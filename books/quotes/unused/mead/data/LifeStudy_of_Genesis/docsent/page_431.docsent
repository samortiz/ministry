   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>d Further Striving by Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After praying such a marvelous prayer, Jacob surely should have been at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But he was still active.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead of sleeping, he "took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother" v. 13 . He divided this present into nine droves "and delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove" v. 16 . The purpose of this was to see what Esau's attitude toward Jacob would be.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jacob was clever, sending a present of nine droves of cattle to Esau with a space between each drove.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This increased the distance between him and Esau and allowed him time to learn what Esau would do so that he might have the opportunity to prepare himself for a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consider the whole picture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Firstly, Jacob divided his people into two camps.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then, after praying an excellent prayer, he should have gone peacefully to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But instead of doing so, he formed nine droves of cattle as a present for Esau in order to increase the distance between himself and Esau, thus giving him time to prepare to cope with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a portrait of a very strange experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, Jacob prayed earnestly, but on the other hand, he exercised his wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a photograph of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Jacob might have done this only once, I have done it many times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, I tried my best to prepare for coping with a troublesome situation, and on the other hand, I prayed earnestly to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter how good my prayer was, I still did not trust in it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob prayed very well, but he had no trust in his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If he had, he probably would not have been so active afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I had been one of Jacob's servants, I might have said, "Jacob, after praying such a prayer, you don't need to do so much."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jacob called the nine droves of cattle a present, but they were actually a bribe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do not believe that Jacob had such a good, loving heart toward his brother Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This present did not issue out of a heart of love but out of a heart of fear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Its purpose was to appease Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jacob even said, "I will appease him with the present that goeth before me" v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While Jacob's people and servants might have been sleeping peacefully, he himself could not rest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was desperate before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was a matter of life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jacob anticipated that a slaughter was coming, feeling quite certain that Esau would slay him and his family.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, Jacob had no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suddenly, as Jacob was left alone, "there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day" v. 24 . This combatant was not an angel but the Lord Himself in the form of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only the Bible could have this kind of story.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Much to Jacob's surprise, in the depths of the night, while he was desperate, a man came to him trying His best to pin him down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because Jacob would not give in, the two of them wrestled all night until the breaking of day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before this, Jacob was afraid of being slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now, he was afraid of being defeated in this wrestling match and he thrust all his energy into the struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord did not subdue him immediately so that He might expose to Jacob how natural he was and how great his natural strength was.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, the Lord touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, causing him to become lame.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Still, Jacob would not let Him go until He blessed him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We shall consider this more in the following message.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In his dream at Bethel, Jacob received the firm promise from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord had told him, "Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of" 28:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, when it was time for Jacob to leave Laban, the Lord said to Jacob, "Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee" 31:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Jacob still trusted in himself and exercised his natural skill and ability to save himself from the difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He also had a desperate time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It would seem that after all this, Jacob would no longer do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in chapter thirty-three we see that Jacob had not yet ceased from his own striving.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no indication, even in this chapter, that Jacob trusted in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After wrestling with the Lord who came in the form of a man, "Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men" 33:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After all the Lord's promises, after his prayer, and after wrestling with the Lord, Jacob still had something new to do.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He divided his wives and children again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His first division was a division of his people into two camps according to the two camps of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His second division was that of his present into nine droves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But now, after reconsidering the matter, he redivided his people according to his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"He divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last" 33:1-2, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because Jacob loved Rachel and Joseph, he put them last.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even here, at the last minute, Jacob still exercised his skill to cope with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The two maids and their children went first, to be a sacrifice if necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The second group, including Leah and her children, followed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rachel, the one he loved so much, and her child, Joseph, were last.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the work of the supplanter, the one who is altogether natural.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He had had the promises of God, the dealings and sufferings, the excellent prayer, the wrestling, and the previous dividing of his people, but still he did something else.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is what I mean when I say that this chapter relates a strange experience.</S>
