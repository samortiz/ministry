This book, The Song of Songs, is specially prepared for them. Spiritual fellowship in the secret place is such a holy thing that it should be sealed. But God has chosen to reveal it to us in the Song of Songs so that we can comprehend the pathway of love and be encouraged to go on.</P><P>This exposition was released by our brother in the Lord to a few co-workers many years ago. A brief record of the messages was kept by one co-worker. It was printed in Chungking in 1945 because of a timely need. It was reprinted in 1948 by the church in Tsingtao, and we are reprinting it again in Taiwan. We must clarify that the original manuscript was never edited by the writer himself.</P><P>May the Lord use this book to help all those who are seeking after Him. Amen.</P><P>The Taiwan Gospel Book Room<br>January 1954</P>
