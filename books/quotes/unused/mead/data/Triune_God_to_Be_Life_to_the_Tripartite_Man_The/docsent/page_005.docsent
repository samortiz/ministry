   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Tree of Life as Man's Food</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Indicating Dependence</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God as food to man indicates that man is dependent upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot eat one meal and live forever.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have often thought that it would be wonderful if God had created us so that we needed to eat only one time for our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If this were the case, it would spare us a great deal of trouble, because much time is spent on food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The food we eat must be purchased from the grocery store, stored, cleaned, cut or sliced, and cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes my wife becomes tired of cooking for me, and I sometimes become tired of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To sit and eat for thirty-five minutes sometimes becomes a difficult task for me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On one hand, eating is an enjoyment, but on the other hand, eating is a difficult job.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is gracious to make eating an enjoyment to us, because if it were not an enjoyment, many of us would not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eating makes us very dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we must eat many times a day, and not merely one time for our entire life, we are very dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eating indicates dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That God is our food, signified by the tree of life, means that we must depend on God continually.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must come to Him in order to feed on Him again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the tree of knowledge indicates independence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once we learn how to use a computer in school, we do not need to go back to school to learn the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The knowledge we gain makes us independent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Genesis 2 the tree of life and the tree of knowledge were set up as two principles by which man could live.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we take the tree of life, we depend on God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we take the tree of knowledge, we do not depend on God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, taking the tree of knowledge makes us independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the eyes of God, the greatest sin is independence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must learn to depend on God continually.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To exercise our independence is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In family life and in the church life, dependence is beautiful, but independence is ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To exercise independence is the principle of death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To take the tree of life is life, but to take the tree of knowledge is death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>GOD'S PROHIBITING THE FALLEN MAN,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BY THE CHERUBIM AND THE FLAMING SWORD,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>FROM TAKING THE TREE OF LIFE INDICATING THAT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>GOD'S GLORY, HOLINESS, AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>DO NOT ALLOW THE SINFUL MAN</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>TO ABUSE THE LIFE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Adam and Eve took of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, they chose the principle of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their choice cut them off from the tree of life Gen 3:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge, they were corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were no longer pure, because another source entered into them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This source was the nature and principle of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This nature and principle is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such a nature entered into man in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, man's life was corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of this corrupting element, God is prohibited by His glory signified by the cherubim , holiness signified by the flame , and righteousness signified by the sword from contacting fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, when the requirement of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness is fulfilled, His glory, holiness, and righteousness are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, having been redeemed back to his original state before the fall, man can once again exercise his right to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The tree of life, signifying God as life, was temporarily kept away from fallen man Gen 3:22-24 until Christ came to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His redemption satisfied God's glory, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, through Christ's redemption the way was opened for fallen man to contact God.</S>
