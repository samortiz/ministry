THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE</h2><p>In 12:1-3 we have the governing principle of the spiritual gifts. In verse 1 Paul says, &ldquo;Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.&rdquo; In chapters twelve through fourteen Paul deals with the ninth problem among the Corinthians, the problem of spiritual gifts in relation to God&rsquo;s administration and operation.</p><p>In verses 2 and 3 Paul continues, &ldquo;You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led. Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The apostle&rsquo;s thought here is that the dumb, voiceless idols in verse 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless. But the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit. This kind of speaking is related to the spiritual gifts. No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, &ldquo;Jesus is accursed&rdquo;; he would like to say and he is able to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; No worshippers of God should be silent, but all should use their voices to speak forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God. This&mdash;to speak the Lord Jesus&mdash;is the main function of all the spiritual gifts.</p><p>The governing principle of the gifts is to speak by our spirit with the Spirit, that is, to utter something with the Spirit in our spirit. This kind of speaking is centered on the Lord Jesus. Therefore, what we speak should be focused on Christ. Christ should be the substance, the element, the essence, the center, and the circumference of our speaking.</p><p>When Paul writes about the gifts of the members of the Body, he begins by speaking of &ldquo;dumb idols.&rdquo; The gifts, of course, have nothing to do with idols. But what Paul says concerning the spiritual gifts is spoken against the Corinthians&rsquo; background in idol worship. In verse 2 Paul reminds them that when they were of the nations, of the Gentiles, they were &ldquo;led away to dumb idols.&rdquo; Here Paul does not say they were led away to sins, lusts, or the world; he says that they were led away to dumb idols, in whatever way they were led. No matter by what way they were led, they were led to dumb idols. Paul&rsquo;s use of the adjective &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; implies that both the idols and those who worship them are dumb, unable to speak. When the Corinthians were unbelievers, they also were dumb; they were silent worshippers of dumb idols. This means that when they worshipped the idols, they did not speak. Rather, because the idols were dumb, they also were dumb, silent. But after coming to believe in Christ, they are now worshippers of the living God.</p><p>It is by speaking that we prove that we are living. Our God is living. The Bible reveals that our living God is the speaking God. Throughout the centuries, especially in this New Testament age, God has been speaking. To prove that we are a living member of Christ, we also must speak. We do not mean, of course, that we should speak in a light way or that we should gossip. Instead, we should speak something for the Lord and even speak forth the Lord. We need to speak things which are centered on Christ. Furthermore, Christ must be our speaking, our utterance. He must be the center and circumference of our speech. To speak Christ in this way is a strong proof that we are living. Because the God whom we worship is the living and speaking God, we also speak and thereby prove that we are the living members of the Body of Christ.</p><p>I can testify from experience that the more I speak, the more living I am. To speak is actually to breathe. When I speak by exercising my spirit, I breathe Christ in. Day by day, we need to speak Christ to our husband or wife, to our children, and to our neighbors. We need to speak Christ, taking Him as our center. This speaking is the governing principle of the spiritual gifts.</p><p>According to verse 3, our speaking must be governed by the Lord Jesus. In this verse Paul says, &ldquo;Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed.&rdquo; The Greek words rendered, &ldquo;Jesus is accursed,&rdquo; literally are &ldquo;Anathema Jesus.&rdquo; Anathema denotes a thing or person accursed; set apart, devoted, to woe. To say &ldquo;Jesus is accursed&rdquo; means to speak negatively concerning Christ. Whenever someone speaks in a negative way about Christ, that is a curse.</p><p>In verse 3 Paul also says, &ldquo;No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This is a literal translation of the Greek. This verse indicates that when we say with a proper spirit, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we are in the Holy Spirit. Hence, to call on the Lord Jesus is the way to participate in, to enjoy, and to experience the Holy Spirit.</p><p>We have just pointed out that the literal translation of the Greek in verse 3 is &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When we say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; we admit that the Lord Jesus is the Lord. But when we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we not only make such an admission, but we also call on Him. To say &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; is sweeter than saying &ldquo;Jesus is Lord.&rdquo; This difference can be illustrated in the way we may speak of our father. For example, to say, &ldquo;This is my father,&rdquo; is not as sweet and intimate as to say, &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; In your daily living do you say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; or do you more often call, &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo;? Most of us would testify that we call, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; much more frequently than we declare, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord.&rdquo;</p><p>No doubt, the expression &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; in verse 3 indicates calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. Today some oppose the practice of calling on the name of the Lord. But in 12:3 Paul definitely refers to calling on the Lord audibly. The translation &ldquo;Jesus is Lord&rdquo; does not indicate calling. But the literal rendering &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; indicates not only an admission, but also an address, a calling on the Lord.</p><p>Many of us can testify that calling on the name of the Lord Jesus causes us to be living. When we feel somewhat depressed, we simply need to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and we are strengthened and uplifted. Reports have come to us that a number of saints in a certain place have been helped by calling on the name of the Lord and by pray-reading. One brother testified that the Lord has given us His Word, His Spirit, and His name. We may enjoy His Word by pray-reading; we may enjoy His Spirit by following the anointing; and we may enjoy His name by calling on the name of the Lord.</p><p>As those who worship the living God, we must speak. However, many Christians are dumb. The Pentecostal movement came in as a reaction to this dumbness. At different times in the past, there have also been reactions against the dumbness of formal religion. For example, at the time of John Wesley, the preaching of the Word was limited to the sanctuary. No one was allowed to preach in a secular place. But John Wesley reacted against that restriction and preached outdoors, on the streets and even to miners as they came from the coal mines after work. Inspired by Wesley&rsquo;s preaching, some repented and wept. Others, beside themselves for joy, shouted to the Lord.</p><p>Christ is God&rsquo;s Word, God&rsquo;s speaking. Thus, when we enjoy Christ, we also shall speak. We shall speak forth Christ and, at times, even shout Christ forth. On our way to the meetings of the church, we should not be dumb. Even as we are on the way, we should speak Christ and then bring Christ to the meeting by our speaking.</p><p>To say that Jesus is accursed is to utter negative things concerning Him. But to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; means to speak of Him in a positive way. Furthermore, in 12:3 Paul tells us that no one can say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; except in the Holy Spirit. What an encouraging word! As long as we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; with a proper spirit, we are in the Holy Spirit. Do you feel that you are not in the spirit? Then call on the name of the Lord Jesus. By calling on His name, you will breathe in the heavenly air, the Holy Spirit, and you will be in the Spirit. However, if you are silent, not calling on the Lord, you will not breathe in the spiritual air. This will make you spiritually unhealthy and unhappy. But the more you speak for Christ and even speak Christ, the happier you will be. We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have many positive things to talk about. We have Christ, we have the church life, and we have God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Let us all learn to speak Christ. This speaking is the governing principle of the spiritual gifts.</p><p>When we were in Elden Hall in Los Angeles in 1970, the meetings always started well ahead of the scheduled time. The saints gathered to speak, sing, shout, and praise long before the scheduled meeting time. But in certain places today there is a tendency for the saints to be silent. It seems many have lost their function and their gift. This opens the way for a return to the fallen situation, where there are meetings with forms and a system of clergy-laity. In the church all the members should be living and speaking. Then all the time will be filled with the speaking of Christ and for Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_171.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_173.html">Next</a> </body></html>
