   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Abib A New Beginning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord told Moses and Aaron that they had to make the month of their redemption the beginning of months, the first month of the year to them Exo 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This month in which they came out of Egypt is the month Abib 13:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Originally, this month was the seventh month, but the Lord made it to be the first month of the year, the beginning of all the months.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the beginning God created, but what God had created was put into a coffin in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, there was the need of another beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The beginning in Genesis 1 was buried in a coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in Exodus 12, God made another beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first beginning is in Genesis 1, and that beginning was for creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second beginning is in Exodus 12, and this beginning was for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first beginning was for creation with the purpose of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second beginning was for redemption with the same purpose of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has the same purpose with two beginnings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to realize that we have had two beginnings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we received the Lord, we had another beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This first month of the year was called Abib.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Strong s Concordance tells us that this word means a young ear of grain or green ears of corn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ears of corn that are young, green, and tender point to a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Young s Concordance tells us that Abib refers to something sprouting and budding.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the start of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When some people ask me what the date of my birth is, I would like to tell them that my birthday is Abib.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abib was our beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This beginning is not the beginning of creation but the beginning of a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Something is sprouting, budding, with the green, young, and tender ears of corn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This signifies new life and also indicates something further than the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This new life is something budding, something that sprouts, something that produces green, tender, young ears, and something that is growing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to learn how to understand the Bible by looking at the pictures in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A picture is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This second beginning is the beginning of life and this life is a budding, sprouting life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lamb for Life</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The children of Israel were in a coffin in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if they were brought out of Egypt and put into Canaan, they were still dead, without life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They needed to be brought out of the coffin, out of Egypt, and they needed life put into them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The life is signified by the meat of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Exodus 12 tells us that the Lord told the children of Israel to prepare the lamb according to every man's eating v. 4 . If a person could eat more, he would have to prepare more of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that the lamb is prepared not according to redemption, but according to the life capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because the lamb is not merely for redemption but more importantly for life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you need a bigger portion or a smaller portion of the lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may think that you are so sinful and that your sins are greater than others so you need a bigger Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a human concept but not the divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The divine concept is that we have to prepare the lamb according to our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is allotted to us according to the eating capacity, the life capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our intention is not to lower down the value of the Lord's redemption, but many Christians stress redemption and forget the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I heard a number of messages on the Passover when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The blood of the Lamb that redeems us and causes God to pass over us was always stressed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is good and true, but we need to realize that the blood is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The blood is the procedure to reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The goal is life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The goal is that we may have the Lamb get into us, that we may have the Lamb within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because we are sinful in the eyes of God, we need the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The children of Israel were fallen and sinful like the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the night of the Passover, God came to the earth to judge the sinful people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without the covering of the blood, the children of Israel would be smitten by God in the same way that the Egyptians would.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But God gave them the way for God to pass over them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They needed the covering of the blood, so they killed the lamb according to God's instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They took the blood of the lamb and put it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of their houses Exo 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then their houses were sprinkled with the redeeming blood, and they were eating the meat of the lamb within their houses.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that they were under the covering of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then God came to judge Egypt and smote everyone who was not under the covering of the blood of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But God passed over the children of Israel who were under this covering.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the Egyptians were being smitten by God, the children of Israel were enjoying the meat of the lamb under the covering of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, the blood is for the meat, that is, redemption is for life.</S>
