Pentecostalists</H2><P>[The Pentecostalists represent another extreme. They may neglect the Word and emphasize the Spirit in an abnormal, unbalanced way.] [Their attention is fully occupied by their thought of the Spirit. They do not see that without the Word, the Spirit is in vain. We all have to realize the Spirit comes after the Word.]</P><P>[We should not be at either extreme, but should be balanced, caring both for the Spirit and the Word. Within, we have the Spirit, and in our hands we have the Word, the Bible.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE SPIRIT EMBODIED IN THE WORD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Spoken Words Being<br>the Embodiment of the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>We can say that the Spirit and the Word are one because this is clearly revealed in the Bible. The Lord Jesus said, "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" (John 6:63). [The Spirit is living and real, but rather mysterious, intangible, and difficult for people to apprehend, but the words are substantial. Firstly, the Lord indicated that for giving life He would become the Spirit. ["It is the Spirit who gives life." John 6:63a] Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life. This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit. He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we receive the Spirit who is life.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Scripture Being God's Breath</H2><P>[Second Timothy 3:16 says that all Scripture is God-breathed. Every word of the Bible is the breath of God. We have pointed out that this breath is the pneuma, the Spirit. Thus, because both the Word and the Spirit are the breath of God, they are truly one. The Spirit is the breath of God, and the Word also is God's breath. Furthermore, God's breath is His pneuma, the Spirit. On the one hand, the Word of God is the Spirit; on the other hand, the Spirit of God is the Word.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Word and the Spirit Being One</H2><P>Furthermore, Ephesians 6:17 even identifies the Word as the Spirit. "And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God." In this verse the Spirit and the Word are one thing.</P><P>[Ephesians 5:18-19 says that when we are filled with the Spirit, we will sing hymns and songs. But Colossians 3:16 says that when we are filled with the Word, we will sing hymns and songs. Ephesians and Colossians are "sister books." They always go together. Ephesians says that when we are filled with the Spirit, we will sing. Colossians says that when we are filled with the Word, we will sing. When we compare these two parts of the Bible, we realize that the Spirit is the Word and the Word is the Spirit!]</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
