<h2 class=head2>B. Staying in Fellowship with all the Churches</h2><p>All the local churches should remain in fellowship with one another. No church is a separate entity. All the local churches constitute the one Body of Christ. Each local church may have different practical needs locally, but its main need is to be filled up with the one Triune God. Each local church may have a different administration (eldership), but one universal fellowship. No local church should be secretive. There should be no particular fellowship between local churches. Any saint can fellowship with any local church at any time. The spiritual and financial surplus as well as the needs of a local church should not be restricted to one particular locality. The churches should fellowship with each other regarding their surplus and lack. In this way, all the churches will maintain the proper relationship for the building up of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>VII. THE PRACTICE OF THE ONENESS OF THE BODY LOCALLY</h2><h2 class=head2>A. On the Ground of Oneness</h2><p>In order to practice the oneness of the Body locally, we must stand on the ground of oneness. Many groups of Christians call themselves churches. But what ground are they standing on when they call themselves churches? Many take the ground of nationality, for example, the Church of England, Chinese for Christ, etc. Many take the ground according to a person, such as the Lutheran Church. Some take the ground of practice, for example, the Baptist church. Some say that unless a person is baptized their way, he is not saved. Some say that unless a person rests on Saturday (Sabbath), he is going to hell. All these are divisive grounds. What ground should we take? The genuine ground of oneness. Since the Triune God is one, we should receive all those He has received (Rom. 15:7). We are one with all the ones God the Father created and begot, with the ones Christ redeemed and loved, and with the ones the Spirit regenerated and is transforming.<p>Christians always like to ask, “What church do you go to?’’ We should never ask this question. There is only one church. All the saved ones are in the church. All are one in Christ. Christ is not divided; there cannot be more than one church. We do not go to church because we are the church. We do not join any denominations because they are built on divisive ground. Joining a denomination will cause us to be divided from other Christians. We fellowship with all the believers, yet we should never join a divisive group. We stand on the ground of oneness, one with the Triune God, accepting all the believers in Christ.<p>Some say they are interdenominational—accepting people from all denominations. The problem is that they all return to their denominations. They are not truly standing on the ground of oneness. They are shaking hands over a fence.<p>Some call themselves non-denominational churches. These are like those in 1 Corinthian 1:12 who said that they were of Christ. They still separate themselves from all other believers. They are “free groups’’ not standing on the genuine ground of oneness.<p>The Biblical principle is one church in one city. It is not many churches in one city or one church over many cities. Denominational, interdenominational, and non-denominational churches are not built on the genuine ground of oneness. The genuine ground of oneness is in the Triune God, accepting all believers, and having one church in one city, yet fellowshipping with the apostles and the other local churches. Without such a genuine ground of oneness, it is impossible to build up the church.
