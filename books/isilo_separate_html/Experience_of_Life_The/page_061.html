The main purpose of experiencing the anointing is that we touch God Himself and have His presence. For example, if we deliver a message, it is not only a question of whether or not we should speak, but whether or not we have the presence of God while speaking. If God is not present, no matter how much or how well we speak, our inward being becomes emptier and emptier until at the very end of the message our spirit is completely empty; we cannot even pray for some time. On the other hand, if there is the presence of God, we feel inwardly watered; the more we speak, the more we are satisfied. It is just like the Lord Jesus, who after He finished His talk with the Samaritan woman, was inwardly satisfied (John 4:31-34). Such watering and satisfaction were the result of the anointing. Therefore, when one ministers under the anointing, others receive the supply and are benefited, and he himself receives a greater portion of the element of God. Another example is that when planning to go somewhere, we should ask not only whether we should go, but also whether God is with us. &#8220;Do I have the presence of God like the Israelites in the wilderness, with the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire?&#8221; If God&#8217;s presence is not within us, though we are doing the best thing, it is of no spiritual value. Therefore, the presence of God is of primary importance and depends upon His anointing. Once we have the anointing, we sense the light of God&#8217;s face and obtain His presence. Without the anointing, we lose the light of His face and fail to touch His presence.<p>In the past, although some brothers and sisters learned the lesson concerning the anointing, they placed their attention upon the outward guidance, thereby neglecting the increase of God&#8217;s element within them. Therefore, the element of God within them was of a limited measure, and after a few years His element within them remained the same. During those few years they did nothing wrong or licentious; they feared the Lord and lived as though they were in the presence of God, but God&#8217;s element did not increase within them. Actually, their spiritual life had not increased, because in their experience of obeying the teaching of the anointing, they gave attention only to God&#8217;s guidance and neglected the aspect of God&#8217;s presence.<h2 class=head2>D. The Result of Obedience to the Teaching of the Anointing</h2><p>Since the anointing is vital to God&#8217;s presence, we need to obey the teaching so we can experience more of the anointing. Then we can live at all times and in all places in the presence of God, living in the light of His face and touching His presence moment by moment. At this time we can enter into the reality of the hymn which says:<p class=hbody>We have passed the riven veil, Here the glories never fail; We are living in the presence of the King!<p>When man passes through the veil of the flesh and lives in the presence of God, he enters into the Holy of Holies and lives in the spirit, having fellowship face to face with God. It is at this time that our spiritual experience reaches its peak.<p>In conclusion, the key to all our spiritual life is the anointing. We should continually touch the anointing and obey its teaching. When we live in the teaching of the anointing, we are walking according to the spirit, living in the fellowship of the Lord and in God&#8217;s presence. If once we lose the teaching of the anointing, the leading of the Holy Spirit is absent, our fellowship with the Lord ceases, and the light in God&#8217;s face is lost; consequently, we have no way to live in His presence. Therefore, the teaching of the anointing is truly the center of all spiritual experience and is also a very wonderful part of God&#8217;s salvation. May we pay more attention to it and experience it more!<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_060.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_062.html">Next</a> </body></html>
