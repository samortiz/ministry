<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIXTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HANDING ONESELF OVER<br>FOR THE SERVICE IN THE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (17)</H1><P>Date:Evening, April 23, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TESTIMONY</H2><P>Brother Chang Hsing-yung testified: During the past four years, I was persecuted by the Japanese, and both my arms and legs were injured. Although men rejected me, the Lord delivered me out of the rubble. Later, I went to Shanghai and Taiwan. In both places, I loved money more than I loved God. This time a brother informed me of this co-workers' conference, and I was able to make it. Now I have received the light, and I am willing to consecrate myself afresh to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAMMON BEING<br>THE GREATEST HINDRANCE TO GOD</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee: I deeply feel that the Lord is mainly after men, and not money. From Brother Chang's testimony, we can see that the greatest hindrance to serving God is mammon. This is not to say that mammon is the only hindrance, but we can say that mammon is the most serious hindrance. It hinders us from serving the Lord with all the saints. Today, the hindrance within us is money, and the hindrance outside of us is also money. Money is the greatest hindrance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HANDING OVER ONESELF<br>FOR THE SERVICE IN THE BODY</H2><P>Originally, during the co-workers' conference in the past few days there was no intention to speak on the matter of mammon; we were only speaking on the Body and on submission to authority in the Body. To serve the Lord, we have to serve Him in the Body, and we have to hand ourselves over. If you do not hand yourself over, there is no way for you to serve. From this, we continued on with the line of handing over. In handing oneself over, not only must the work be handed over, but the money has to be handed over also. Once we touched the matter of handing over, we found out that this matter has a tail, and that tail is money.</P><P>Are you satisfied with the way you serve the Lord? We do not have to ask God about this matter. We only need to ask ourselves. If the Lord were to reckon with us today, could we give to Him a proper account? If our hearts condemn us, how much more will God condemn us also (1 John 3:20)? If you have not yet been coordinated in the church, your heart will surely not be satisfied. You can be zealous and eloquent, but you will not be satisfied, because today is not the day for new teachings any longer. You can love the Lord and have faith in Him, but today the way of individual service is a dead-end road. I dare not say whether this was true one hundred or two hundred years ago. But God's need today is that we take the Body way. When we feel dissatisfied within, it means that the Body has a demand. The Lord requires that we serve Him today in the Body of His Son. No matter how many souls you have saved or how much work you have done, if you are not in the Body, you will not be satisfied with your service.</P><P>The words "handing over" are an apt and clear-cut expression. When you hold back yourself, you are giving yourself trouble. If you hold back yourself, you can only drag your feet in the way of serving the Lord. We cannot hold back anything in our consecration. If we do, we are offering to God burnt offerings with the dung attached. Before the burnt offerings are offered up, the dung has to be washed away. We have to have a clear dealing concerning everything related to us before we can consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</P>
