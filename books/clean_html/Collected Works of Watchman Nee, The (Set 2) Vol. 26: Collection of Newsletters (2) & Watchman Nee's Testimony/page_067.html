<h1 class="title">>WATCHMAN NEE'S TESTIMONY</h1><h1 class="msg">PREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION</h1><p>The following is a new edition of the original book Watchman Nee's Testimony. The old edition that was first printed in 1974 was somewhat different from the original manuscript. We have secured the original unedited Chinese copy of the manuscript of the compiler, Brother K.H. Weigh, and have retranslated it into English. The result is the following revised edition of the book.</p>
