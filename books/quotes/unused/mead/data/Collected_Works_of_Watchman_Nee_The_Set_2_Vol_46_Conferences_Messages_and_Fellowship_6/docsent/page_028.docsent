   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HEALING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the past I have been asked quite often to pray for the sick.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Immediately after the prayer, I knew whether or not the person was going to be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After entering the room I would anoint him, depending upon the situation, and after my prayer I would ask, "Well, how is your sickness?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The answer would show at once whether or not the person had faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he said, "Praise the Lord, it is all settled," he might still feel very weak and have a high fever, but he could praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would then ask, "Do I need to come back and pray again?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he said that there is no need because it was all done, I could leave in confidence, no matter how serious his condition seemed to be, because he did not believe that God would heal him, but that He had already healed him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes when I asked a person about his sickness, the answer was different: "I believe that the Lord is going to heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am as certain as anything that God is going to heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe with all my heart that I am going to be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He may seem to have all the faith in the world that he is going to be healed, but I go home disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I know that he is not going to be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There was no divine touch, no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The man said that he believed, but he did not believe at all, he only hoped.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do we see the importance of Mark 11:24?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God says we must believe that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once the Lord granted me a wonderful healing, and I testified to a few of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among them was a sister who had very serious eye trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every week she had to travel a considerable distance by steamboat to be treated by a doctor, under whose care she had gradually improved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She heard my testimony and thought, "Though the doctor said I would be better, he said I never could be normal again."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So she prayed and believed that the Lord would heal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But she had an appointment with the doctor and so she went to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He gave her some glasses and a jar of ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After she got on the steamboat, she prayed again and said, "Lord, are You really going to heal me?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She believed that the Lord had already heard her prayers and that the thing was done.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So she said, "Lord, what do I need these glasses and ointment for?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, Satan said, "Do not be so quick; do not be excessive; do not be fanatical.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Wait and see if it works.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If it does not work, you will still have your glasses and ointment to fall back on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way, you will be protected on both sides."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But she said, "My prayer has been heard; it is already done; I am healed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need for glasses or ointment."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then Satan said, "The glasses cost thirty dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you throw them away, you will be wasting thirty dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If your prayers and faith do not work, you will have to spend another thirty dollars to replace them."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But she said, "I am already healed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What do I need ointment and glasses for?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>So she threw them overboard.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am not suggesting that you throw your glasses away, and that we do not need the help of doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we have faith, we can do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She went back and her eyes were really healed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Remember the Lord's word, "Believe that you have received them, and you will have them."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Faith is always in the past tense, though experience may be in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we make faith a matter of the future, because experience is still in the future, our faith is hope.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the sister returned, she testified of what the Lord had done, and a brother who was in exactly the same circumstances heard her testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was also present when I spoke of what the Lord had done for me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This brother had exactly the same disease and went to the same doctor, who prescribed exactly the same treatment for him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said to himself, "If God is able to heal her eyes, is He not able to heal my eyes?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So he prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then one of my co-workers came to me and said, "Do you know that Brother So-and-so is trusting the Lord to heal his eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is this not grand?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"No," I said, "We should wait to see whether it is hope or faith."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He also had an appointment with the doctor, and he too went to get glasses and ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After he got them, he boarded the same boat and argued, "If I am healed, should I not throw away my glasses and ointment?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He remembered that the sister had thrown her glasses and ointment into the river, and so he did the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He said, "I will trust the Lord and the Lord alone; I will not trust the doctor or medicine."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On his return he came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I asked him, "Why did you throw your glasses and ointment away?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"Oh, I trust God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From today I will not trust man but God alone," he replied.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"What about your eyes?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I asked.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"I can trust God," he said.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then I said, "But you have only those two eyes; they are very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If anything happens to them, you can never replace them."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He said, "I believe God is going to heal my eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"Do you really believe that God is going to heal your eyes?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I asked.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He said, "Yes, if I did not believe that God was going to heal my eyes, do you think that I would have been so foolish as to throw away my glasses and ointment?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I said to him, "I am sorry to say this, but your faith is too big for God to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I am afraid that one day you will have to go back to that doctor and buy another pair of glasses."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"What do you mean?" he asked.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I replied, "You have hope in God but no faith."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He was rather irritated, and he went out and said to another brother, "One day Brother Nee will see that he is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I will prove to him that I have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I know God is going to heal me."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>My co-worker came in and asked, "Why did you say that he has no faith?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Why do you believe that God is not going to heal him?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I replied, "Because he has no faith at all; he has only hope."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>"What do you mean?" he asked.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>"Do you not remember that Mark 11:24 explains the nature of real faith?"</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I said.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He responded, "Do you mean to say that a person who risks blindness does not have real faith?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If this is not faith, what is?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do you mean to say that a person who throws away thirty dollars for his faith and throws away fees amounting to a hundred dollars does not have real faith?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If that is not faith, what is?"</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I said, "These are all works, not faith.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is all something that he has done; it is not believing in what God has done."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Of course, I was more than willing for him to be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I did not want him to not be healed so that I would be proven right!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A month passed, and nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Two months passed, and I saw him again.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>His eyes were redder and the discharge worse.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>One day he came to me and said, "Do you still believe that I do not have faith?"</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I said, "I fear that this is the case."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He replied, "I believe that God is going to heal me.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>One thing I know: God has shown me that I must go up the river to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I will stay for two months, and when I come back, I will be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I said, "Try your best to believe that you will be healed."</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I said nothing to discourage him, but I said to my co-worker, "He believes that if he does something for God, God will do something for him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>His belief is related to the future, not the past."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He came back unhealed, and he had to resort to glasses.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Today he still wears them.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>These two cases were exactly parallel.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>One was healed and one was not healed because one had faith and the other had none.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>One believed and the other only hoped.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We think that if people risk something, they have faith; however, these are the works of men, not the faith of men.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we believe, we should say, "Praise the Lord, it is done."</S>
