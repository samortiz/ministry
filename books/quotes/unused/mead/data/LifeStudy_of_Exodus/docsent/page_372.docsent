   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Pillars</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 11 says, And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings a hundred cubits long, and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of bronze; the hooks of the pillars and their connecting rods shall be of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The phrase of bronze governs both the sockets and the pillars, just as the phrase of silver refers both to the hooks and the connecting rods.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, both the sockets and the pillars were of bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because they have followed a rather ambiguous translation, some Bible teachers may think that the pillars were made out of another material, perhaps silver or acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, neither silver nor acacia wood fits the picture, and neither of these matches the spiritual significance here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The bronze pillars signify Christ judged by God being the standing and supporting strength of the separation of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is not only the base of the separation; He is also the standing and supporting strength of the separation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, both the sockets and the pillars are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this Christ is not a glorified Christ He is a judged Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today we need to live this judged Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to express Him to others, especially to outsiders in the world, we need to be judged in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are judged in everything day by day, we shall express Christ as the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My intention here is not simply to give teachings from the types as admonitions or exhortations to good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No, here we have something more basic, more crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we live Christ, we shall find that His life is a judged life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Him there is an element of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, the more we live Him, the more our daily life will be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This judgment will give us the base and the supporting strength to bear the righteousness of God as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. Sixty, the Number of Both the Pillars</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>and the Sockets</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With the court of the tabernacle there was a total of sixty sockets and sixty pillars: twenty on each side, ten at the rear, and ten at the front.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The front ones were arranged in two groups of three and one group of four.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The number sixty here signifies Christ in the likeness of the man of flesh Rom 8:3; John 3:14 being judged by God according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The number six is implied here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ was judged by God in the likeness of the man of flesh, or in the likeness of the flesh of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, Christ was fully judged by God in the flesh of man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This does not mean that Christ had fallen flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No, He had the likeness of fallen flesh and He was judged in this flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This also is an element of the judged life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this judged life there is an element of the flesh of man being judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all are men of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our flesh must be judged, and in Christ it has been judged already.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we live Christ, we experience God s judgment on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The number sixty implies the number six.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if we add sixty pillars and sixty sockets, we have the number one hundred twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that eventually sixty is swallowed up by one hundred twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the number one hundred and twenty we do not have the number six.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can the number six be swallowed up?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This happens by having the pillars standing in the sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The point here is that if we live Christ, the judged life of Christ will make us sockets and also standing and supporting pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are sockets without being pillars, we are still in the number six.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, if we are pillars without being sockets, we also remain in the number six.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we are both pillars and sockets, we no longer have the number six.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, the number sixty is swallowed up by the number one hundred twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we live Christ, His judged life will bring our daily life under the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Daily we shall be judged in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we shall have the sockets and also the pillars to bear the righteousness of God as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a teaching for the purpose of exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the contrary, this is a revelation in the Bible to show us where our salvation is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our salvation is in the judged Christ.</S>
