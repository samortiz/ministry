   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They believe in the flesh and put their trust in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most obvious sign of unchecked flesh is self-confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Self-confidence is the characteristic of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Philippians 3:3 says, "We are the circumcision, the ones who..have no confidence in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To put no trust in the flesh is to have no confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All those who have been smitten by the cross are broken.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although their person may remain, they have learned to fear God and no longer put their trust and confidence in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before a person is dealt with by the Lord, he quickly judges anything that comes his way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He opens his mouth and makes judgments quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But after a person has been dealt with by the Lord, he does not judge lightly; he no longer has any confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one who makes quick proposals and believes in his own strength knows the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such a person has never experienced the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once our flesh is circumcised, we will not believe in ourselves any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will not be that full of confidence, and we will not express our opinions easily.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the Lord, we must see that we are weak, powerless, helpless, and faltering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God brought Abraham to the point where he realized that his flesh needed to be dealt with, and that the things he did during the past thirteen years were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was no room in God's promise for him to do or accomplish anything; all he needed to do was believe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the same time, God showed him that his descendants for generations to come must be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the basic requirement to be God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The condition for us to be God's people in practicality is to have the mark of the cross upon our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Circumcision is the mark of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the proof of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is a mark?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A mark is a characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's people have a characteristic, a mark, which is the denial of the flesh, the rejection of confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's people are those whose confidence in the flesh has been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are the ones who have lost confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a pity that so many Christians are so confident about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They know how to believe in the Lord Jesus, and they know how to be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They know how to overcome, and they know how to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seems that there is nothing that they do not know!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They brag again and again about this and that kind of experience that they had on certain days of certain months.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It seems that they are lacking in nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They may talk about how they fellowship with God and how they communicate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They think that they know what God is saying concerning certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They think that they know God's will concerning many things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They can talk about what God has told them to speak or pray at such and such a place and at such and such a time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To them, it seems as if knowing God's will is the easiest thing on earth!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet they lack the mark of having "no confidence in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such Christians are indeed in need of God's mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The meaning of circumcision is to cut off the confidence of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is to cut off the natural strength so that one no longer speaks and walks in a loose way, but instead becomes a fearful and trembling person.</S>
