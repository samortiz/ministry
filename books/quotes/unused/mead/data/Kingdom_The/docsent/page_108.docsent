   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LIFE OF REST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another principle of the kingdom is in Matthew 11:28-30.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once we forsake our wisdom and intelligence, we will know the Lord Jesus and have a real enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After this we will have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kingdom life is not only a life of enjoyment; it is also a life of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you will apply the first three principles revealed in Matthew 11, all of your burdens will be lifted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you try to be wise and intelligent, you will be heavily burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You need to be unloaded.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who are the ones that are the most heavily burdened?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is the wise and intelligent ones, the religious ones, and the cultured ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The kingdom people, on the contrary, are the unloaded ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brothers and sisters, are you loaded or unloaded?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you will be simple and single instead of religiously wise and intelligent you will be unloaded, and you will have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The yoke you bear will be very light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The kingdom life is a life of feasting, a life of enjoyment, and a life of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever you lose your rest, it is an indication that you are not experiencing the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever you are not in the kingdom life, you will certainly be heavily burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your yoke will be the yoke of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, when you exercise the principle of forsaking your religious wisdom and intelligence and of being simple, you will be immediately unburdened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You will be released and emancipated and completely at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes people come to me and say, "Brother Lee, you have many burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can you bear them?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I answer, "Brothers, I have no burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I only know how to do a little work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After working, I go home and rest."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the kingdom life some work, but no burden.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is a yoke, but the yoke is not heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, the yoke is also a kind of rest because without it we might depart from the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would attempt to depart from the Lord's way, we would find that the yoke is there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Please bring all of these matters and principles to the Lord and pray over all the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Himself will reveal something more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You will know the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Matthew is a book of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our leprosy is gone, and faith is here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are enjoying and we are resting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let the religious people persecute and let the enemies oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should be violent to enter the kingdom by force.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have no outward regulations, and we have no burdens because we do not exercise our religious wisdom and intelligence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are simple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not care what other people say about us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We only care for the rest in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we are heavily burdened, Satan is happy; but when we are resting, he trembles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the kingdom life.</S>
