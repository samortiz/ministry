<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Carrying Out the Flow of the Spirit</H2><P>In John 7 the Lord told us that the Spirit would flow out of our innermost being as rivers of living water (vv. 38-39). The one flow of the Spirit becomes many rivers. The rivers of living water as the flow of the Spirit flow out of us in resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Forming the Base of His Move<br>in the Ascension of Christ for the Formation<br>of the Church, the Body of Christ</H2><P>Resurrection formed the base of God's move in the ascension of Christ for the formation of the church, the Body of Christ (Acts 5:30-31; Eph. 1:20-23). Without resurrection Christ could never ascend to the heavens, so the resurrection laid the base for His ascension, in which He formed the church. He released His divine life to produce all the members of the Body of Christ, yet they could not be formed into the Body until He ascended into the heavens. It was in His ascension that He formed all the regenerated members, produced in His resurrection, into His one organic Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Empowering the Believers with the Power<br>of Christ's Resurrection for the Conformation<br>to His Death in the Believers' Christian Walk</H2><P>God empowers the believers with the power of Christ's resurrection for the conformation to His death in the believers' Christian walk (Phil. 3:10). We should live a life of death so that we can be conformed to the image of Christ's death. But in ourselves we cannot do this. We need the power of Christ's resurrection. The husbands and wives are a constant and continual problem to each other. This is why there are so many separations and divorces today. But we have the power of Christ's resurrection that empowers us to be conformed to the death of Christ. The power comes not from us but from the resurrection of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Carrying Out the Effectiveness and Killing<br>of the Death of Christ for the Release of<br>the Divine Life in Resurrection</H2><P>It is by the power of Christ's resurrection that we can be conformed to His death. Paul told us that he was always bearing about in his body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also might be manifested in his body (2 Cor. 4:10). Christ's death was always killing Paul. The killing of the cross results in the manifestation of the resurrection life. This daily killing is for the release of the divine life in resurrection.</P><P>These are all the aspects of God's move in Christ's resurrection in humanity. Today God is moving in us, the believers of Christ, in humanity in the resurrection of Christ.</P>
