<h2 class="head1">TWO NECESSARY THINGS</h2><p>In learning to preach the gospel, we have to pay attention to two things. First, we have to understand God's word. We have to find words with "hooks." Second, we have to understand the sinner's heart, that is, we have to understand the condition of those whom we are preaching the gospel to. Concerning the first point, we should study in detail all the verses in the New Testament concerning the gospel. We should begin from the first chapter of Matthew. We should consider how sinners dwelt in darkness and sin, how the Lord preached the gospel to them, and how they were touched. We have to pay attention to how the Lord dealt with sinners and how men received the Lord. When we preach the gospel, we have to visualize these different kinds of sinners before our eyes and consider how we can turn them.</p><h2 class="head2">Finding Words with "Hooks"</h2><p>In preaching the gospel, we should not preach only with the aim of passing on gospel facts. Nor should we try to stir up sinners unnecessarily. Rather, we should preach according to God's word. Our words should have "hooks" that can latch on to men. The words of our preaching should have "hooks" that can catch people. Our job is not merely to convey words but to clinch men with the words. We should not be lazy to exploit these hooks. We have to remember that the effectiveness of preaching does not lie in doctrine but in the "hooks." We should study and constantly analyze the words that bring about salvation in others. If we spend enough time on this, we will discover that every person is captured by some "clincher" words. In preaching the gospel, the main thing is not to make things clear, but to use "clinchers." Every time we apply these "clinchers," men will be saved.</p><p>Gospel preachers should have the habit of asking other brothers and sisters, "With what word were you saved?" We should write these words in a notepad and study them constantly. We should also study our own story of salvation, as well as those who were saved through us. We should read all kinds of gospel stories. We should ask, "What words pricked you? What words smote you?" Write down these words. Then ask, "What words warmed you up and stirred up your desire?" Write down these words as well. Then ask, "What words prompted you to receive the Lord?" Write down these words. We will see something very interesting: The Holy Spirit likes to use words that He has used before to save men. In preaching the gospel, we have to know the words the Spirit likes to use. We have to know which words touch men, subdue men, produce a sense of need in men, prompt men to make a decision, and clinch men. We should be able to develop our own clinchers in addition to using these clinchers.</p><p>The best gospel preachers always bring their audience to a high point and then conquer them with God's word. We have to learn to use words that the Holy Spirit once used. It is very easy for the Holy Spirit to use words that He has used before. For this reason, we urgently need stories of salvation, in particular, stories of those saved through us. A study of these stories will help us find the words that the Holy Spirit has used. By what words were men subdued? We have to pay attention to these words and mark them down. We have said that there are not too many categories of people in this world. Once we know how to deal with these few categories of people, we have just about mastered everything. There is definitely the need to spend time learning the words that subdue people. We need more than one notepad to write down the words that touch men to salvation. Some people are touched in their conscience by certain words. Others are prompted to receive salvation by some other words. We have to record these words in our notepads. When we meet another person in a similar condition, we can use these words on him. In preaching the gospel, all we care for is saving men; we do not care to use too many words. We have to mark the words that the Holy Spirit has used before and try to use them again.</p>
