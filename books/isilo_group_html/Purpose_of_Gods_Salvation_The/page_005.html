<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
AND THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to obtain a Body as a vessel for Christ. Most people do not have the concept that the Body of Christ is His vessel. In Ephesians 1:23 Paul says that the church is &ldquo;His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the church is the Body of Christ and also His fullness. Our natural concept is that the church is simply the church. We lack the deep understanding that the church is the Body of Christ. <em>The Body</em> is a particular expression. If Paul had not received the revelation that the church is the Body of Christ, I doubt that anyone would have had such an understanding. It is easy for us to understand the church as an assembly, a group of people gathering together. However, we cannot imagine that the church is a Body. Even though we have read in the Bible that the church is the Body of Christ, and we often talk about the church being the Body of Christ, we still do not have much feeling concerning the Body of Christ. What is the church? The most important answer to this question is given to us in the Bible by Paul: &ldquo;the church, which is His Body&rdquo; (vv. 22-23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH HAVING THE LIFE OF CHRIST<br />
AND BEING A PART OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>As soon as we speak of the human body, two matters immediately come to mind. First, a person&rsquo;s body has life. A chair or a desk has nothing to do with life. When we speak of a person&rsquo;s body, we know that it has life. Brother So-and-so&rsquo;s body has his life; we can even say that this brother is in his body. Second, a person&rsquo;s body is his main part. A person&rsquo;s body not only has life but is also his main part. Moreover, a person cannot be separated from his body. Likewise, the church being the Body of Christ means that the church has the life of Christ and is a part of Christ. Hence, the church cannot be separated from Christ. We must see that the church is a part of Christ. The church is not formed by gathering natural people together; it is formed by those who are full of Christ. The church is the aggregate of those who allow Christ to fully occupy them.</p>
<p>Apparently, Brother A and Sister B are in the church. However, strictly speaking, there are no such persons in the church. We can say this because anyone who comes into the church must not only die but also be buried. According to the Bible, the primary meaning of baptism is burial, that is, termination on the cross. The first thing that happens to a person who believes in the Lord is that he dies and is buried. Any saved person who is part of the church has been put into water and buried. No natural person can enter into the church, because every natural person is buried in the water before coming into the church. &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). I have already died and been buried, and now it is Christ who lives in me. In the church as the new man, there cannot be Jew or Greek (Col. 3:10-11). It is disastrous to bring our natural man into the church. In the church as the new man, there are neither Americans nor Chinese; there is only Christ. If there were Jews, Greeks, Americans, or Chinese, it would be a social group, not the church. In the church there is only Christ, because the church is a part of Christ. Moreover, only Christ is all and in all in the new man. The church is the Body of Christ, and every part of the church is Christ. This is the same as saying that every member of my body is part of me. A false tooth may look exactly like a real tooth, but it is not part of a person&rsquo;s body. We must see that the church is Christ Himself; as such, the church does not have room for the natural man, which is outside of Christ. Just as dentures are not a part of a person&rsquo;s body, any natural element cannot become a part of the church.</p>
<p>Christians lack the reality of the church because there is too much of the human element and too little of Christ&rsquo;s element. A Western missionary once asked me, &ldquo;Why are you so old-fashioned, following the ancient Chinese way of having men sit on one side of a room and women on the other side?&rdquo; He said that we should copy the Western way of letting the men and the women sit together. I replied that we do not have an Eastern concept or a Western concept; it is acceptable among us for men and women to sit together or for them to sit on separate sides of the room. If we have seen that everything natural has been thoroughly terminated, we would not have feelings concerning such matters. Furthermore, we would not insist on any practice, because to insist is to give the human element a place in the church.</p>
<p>A brother from the West once said to me that our meetings are good in every respect except that often everyone prays at the same time. He considered this to be the way Chinese people study in school and, hence, a Chinese custom. He also said that people in the West pray one at a time and, hence, not many people pray. I told him that we cannot require the church to follow either the East or the West, because in the prayer of the church there is neither East nor West; there is only Christ and the Spirit. We all are the one Body of Christ. We must rid ourselves of our natural concepts and natural feelings.</p>
<p>A newly baptized brother who was quite knowledgeable once said to me that it is not proper for everyone to say Amen when a person prays, because such noisy worship forces God to leave our meetings. On another occasion a brother was critical and asked why Christians have so many different postures when they pray; some sway and others shake. I said that our personal opinion, insight, or feeling is not the criterion in the church. We must remember that we have been buried. Hence, we should never rashly criticize the actions of any brother or sister in their service to the Lord. We should never think that the church should follow our considerations in its practice. The church is neither you nor I, and it is neither the East nor the West. Hence, the church does not follow our feelings or our views. The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ wants to fill everyone who belongs to Him in the church. In matters related to our service and in other things as well, we must not forget that we have already been buried and that Christ is everything in the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Purpose of God's Salvation &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
