THE ARM OF JEHOVAH</H2><P>Whatever is covered in chapters forty-one through sixty-six of Isaiah concerns Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in relation to Israel's return and restoration. In Israel's return and restoration, the all-inclusive Christ is, first, the arm of Jehovah, second, the reigning God, and, third, the exalted Christ.</P><P>The arm of Jehovah signifies the strength of Jehovah. Christ as the arm of Jehovah is the strength of Jehovah. Isaiah 51:9 begins, "Arise, arise! Put on strength, / O arm of Jehovah." To put on strength is to wear strength as a garment. Christ is the garment of God as the strength of God.</P><P>Jehovah, the complete Triune God, is the great I Am (Exo. 3:13-14). Whatever we need, He is. In a positive sense, He is everything. He is strength, righteousness, justice, light, and many other items. God as strength is embodied in Christ. In this aspect, His name is the arm of Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Arising and Putting on Strength<br>As in the Days of Old</H2><P>In 51:9-11 Isaiah cried out that the arm of Jehovah should arise and put on strength as in the days of old, as in the generations of past ages, especially as in the exodus of His elect out of Egypt. In the exodus from Egypt, the first obstacle the children of Israel met was the Red Sea. Behind them Pharaoh's army was chasing them, and in front of them was the Red Sea. They could do nothing about the situation, but the arm of Jehovah did something. He caused a strong wind to blow so that the water was divided. The sea was dried up, and Israel walked in the sea on dry land. Isaiah was burdened that the arm of Jehovah would do the same thing in his day so that the captives of Israel would be brought back.</P><P>In Isaiah's prophecy Christ has a name which is called "the arm of Jehovah." This name is mentioned not only in 51:9 but also in 53:1, where Isaiah shouted, "Who has believed our report? / And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?" The arm of Jehovah mentioned in both of these verses is Christ. Christ is the arm of Jehovah, who is the Triune God, the great I Am. Christ is the arm of Jehovah to save God's people.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_241.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_243.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 242</div><br></body></html>
