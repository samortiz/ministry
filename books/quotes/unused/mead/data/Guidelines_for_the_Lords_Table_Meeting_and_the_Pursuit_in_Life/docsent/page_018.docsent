   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Avoiding Formalities</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sixth, we should avoid formal prayers at the table meeting; instead, we should use words of revelation and words that convey spiritual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For instance, at the beginning of the table meeting, a brother may pray, O Lord, once again we come to Your table.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word is formal; it is not of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After singing Hymns, #226 we should normally have a certain feeling or seeing concerning the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not pray with formal phrases, such as once again we..., especially if such a prayer was offered earlier in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose we were invited to a meal and have been sitting for a while at the dinner table.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the food is put on the table, we should take it and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It would be formal for us to say, Once again let us come and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we pray, we should simply say, O Lord, we thank You for the bread and for the cup; we are here in remembrance of You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>O Lord, thank You for giving us the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The principle is that we mention the bread and the cup directly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can also say, O Lord, our hearts are filled with sweetness as we sing with our mouths and behold the bread and the cup with our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>O Lord, You are the sweetest One.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is somewhat poetic.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After this we can pray with words of revelation concerning the bread: O Lord, although we are here breaking the bread, the bread was actually broken on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This word is significant because it shows that we can break the bread today because the Lord was broken at the time of His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should continually refer to the bread in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For instance, we may say, Lord, we praise You that You were broken; You are no longer unbroken.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because You were broken, we can have Your life, Your very person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we have finished praying concerning the bread, we should go on to speak concerning the cup, still using words of revelation and of a poetic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then all the saints will have the inward revelation: O Lord, the bread is so good, and the cup is so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You received the cup as a portion on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You drank the cup of wrath so that today we have the cup of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is because You shed Your blood and died for us that the cup of wrath has become the cup of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this cup, we see the precious blood You shed for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is because You shed Your blood that our sins were taken away from us, and God s riches have come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>O Lord, now we receive this bread and this cup from Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While we are receiving them, we pray that You would add Yourself as a blessing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lord, may we touch the reality of this bread and this cup, not merely the outward bread and cup.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lord, may we break this bread and drink this cup in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must bring the brothers and sisters into the feeling of the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through our prayer, both the bread and the cup are unveiled to the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After our prayer, everyone should have seen the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of revelation is not received instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we need to spend the time and energy to exercise diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If in every locality there are ten saints who know how to select hymns and another ten who know how to pray, the situation of the various meetings will surely be living and full of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, everyone will love to come to the meeting and live the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are fifty-two weeks in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If week by week, we speak the story, the beauty, and the sweetness of the bread and the cup through our prayers, what a rich church life we will have!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, when we are remembering the Lord in a table meeting, we may see the beauty of the Lord s fine living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When it is time to bless the bread and the cup, someone may bless and thank the Lord for the bread and the cup, saying, O Lord, this bread is like the cakes of fine flour in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lord, You are like the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are fine in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then when we break the bread the following week, we may see the suffering of the Lord; thus, we bless the bread and the cup by saying, O Lord, from the time You came to the earth, You suffered continually.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lord, You are the one grain who passed through smiting and grinding.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You suffered Your whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lord, the cup displayed here portrays You as a grape that was crushed, squeezed, and pressed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have suffered so much for us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, we thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way, the saints will know the Lord in His different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must all be desperate before the Lord to avoid formal words and, instead, use words of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, after the bread and the cup are blessed, a brother may select Hymns, #93.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As a rule, someone should offer a prayer that follows the feeling of the hymn, saying, O Lord, because You were betrayed by man and forsaken by God, You measured sin s distance on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This distance includes darkness, wrath, and the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here, despite such a distance, we are receiving the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should then thank and praise the Lord for His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After this, a brother who has seen the revelation that resurrection comes after the cross should pray, O Lord, You not only died, but You also resurrected for us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On one hand, we have seen Your death; on the other hand, we are in Your resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Lord, we are here remembering You in Your resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We praise You that You resurrected and that You are with us now and forever.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today we praise You in Your resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way, the entire meeting will move forward and will be full of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, praying in the table meeting involves many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our prayer may be compared to the four seasons, which can be represented by different kinds of blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our praises concerning the bread and the cup should change according to the season.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, even though we see the Lord s death, we are still in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Furthermore, the utterances of our prayer in a table meeting should not be too free or careless.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For instance, someone may pray, O Lord, You shed Your blood drop by drop.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is not appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may be able to teach in this way in a children s meeting, but we cannot pray like this in a table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That would be a joke.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Another example is to pray, O Lord, our hands have sinned, so Your hands were nailed for us; our feet have sinned, so Your feet were nailed for us; our head has sinned, so Your head was pricked for us...</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may think that this is a good prayer, but this prayer is from the human mind and devoid of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord Jesus hands and feet were nailed not merely because our hands and feet have sinned but because our entire being has sinned, including our ears, our eyes, our tongues, etc. Because of Hymns, #93, we can say to the Lord, On the cross You measured sin s distance.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When You were on the cross, You knew how far away we were from God because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It was not until we saw Your death on the cross that we knew how far away we were from God because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Before You died on the cross, we did not know how far away we were from God, and we did not even realize that we were sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In short, our prayers at the Lord s table meeting should focus on these six principles: being fitly connected, moving forward in the spirit, maintaining the feeling of the meeting, using poetic utterances, having revelation, and avoiding formal expressions.</S>
