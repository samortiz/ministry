   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Direction of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>from the Center to the Circumference</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's work always begins from the center and goes to the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God reveals Himself within man's center, his spirit, then extends to his soul, enlightening his mind, and finally directs his body to execute His will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Take the matter of sanctification as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The God we know in our spirit is absolutely holy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This holy God is joined to our spirit through the Holy Spirit we become one spirit with the Lord .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From this spirit God enlightens our mind, so that our mind begins to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The power of holiness thus begins to operate in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All unholy thoughts are rejected, and anything that is incompatible with God is immediately denied.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way, the soul becomes sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the same time, the effect reaches the body, particularly the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The inward sanctifying power will direct the eyes, so that they can no longer look at anything that is contrary to holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The eyes will shun everything unholy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Holy Spirit speaks through the ones who know holiness in such a genuine way, their words will convey the sanctification that they have seen and experienced, and they will produce an effect in others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Method of the Work Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Revelation is the method by which God works.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation is something of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, the spirit and not the mind comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The spirit and life take priority, while the mind and the intellect follow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many people use their mind and intellect to seek after God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The result is confusion in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will never know God's will this way because the method is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first thing God wants us to do is to wait for His revelation in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After this, He will enlighten our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only then will we know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must remember that the mind is secondary and not primary in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This does not mean that we should not use the mind, but we should use it as a secondary means.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to consider a few things that constitute a spiritual vision.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's Word shows us that at least three things are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The meaning of revelation is an unveiling or a removing of the covering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose that there is a book in a cabinet, yet it cannot be seen because the door of the cabinet is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The door must be opened before the book can be revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The second thing is light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If this room does not have any light, one cannot see anything even when something is placed before his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The third is opened eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A thing may be uncovered and light may be present, but one cannot see anything if his eyes are closed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Holy Spirit unveils the reality of Christ to man through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the same time, He enlightens the mind in man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The mind is man's inner eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As long as a man does not have the eyes of the Laodiceans, he will see.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Laodiceans did not see because they felt that they had something; they thought that they had something.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once there is a thought of having something, that thought becomes a veil to the eyes, and a person becomes blind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Blessed are those who are poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lines of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are two lines in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the negative line, God's work leads man to a knowledge of himself through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once man sees himself, he will apply the cross to deal with sin, the flesh, and the world by the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the positive line, the Holy Spirit reveals Christ to man's spirit and dispenses Christ to man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Man receives Christ by faith and abides in Him, allowing His life to be wrought into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The measure of revelation and knowledge of Christ determines the measure of the stature of one's spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The destination of these two lines of work is the purifying of the "self" to the point that nothing of the "self" remains and only Christ occupies the whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Pattern and Goal of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When Moses built the tabernacle, God showed him the pattern on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He could not change anything; everything had to be built according to the pattern of God's instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today the building work of the Holy Spirit in us is according to the pattern of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nothing apart from Christ can be brought in. The work of the Holy Spirit is absolutely pure, and His work is to make men as pure as the Lord 1 John 3:3 .</S>
