THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION<br>OF THE TRANSFORMATION FOR THE COMPOSITION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</H2><P>Now we want to see the ultimate consummation of the transformation for the composition and constitution of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:1-3, 9-23). The conclusion of the sixty-six books of the Bible is a divine building, the New Jerusalem. This building is a gold mountain, constituted with precious stones and twelve gates of pearl. This is the issue, the consummation, of the entire revelation of the whole Bible. Surely this must be very meaningful. This is why we purposely wrote a number of hymns related to and concerning the New Jerusalem when we were composing our hymnal (see Hymns, #971, 972, 975, 976, 978, 979, 980, 981, 984). I hope that we would learn to sing all these hymns.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Purely of the Originating God</H2><P>The New Jerusalem is purely of the originating God in His divine nature, signified by the pure gold of the base of the city (vv. 18b, 21b). The New Jerusalem is built on a gold mountain, and that gold is the base of the New Jerusalem. The city's being of pure gold signifies that the New Jerusalem is altogether of God's divine nature and takes God's divine nature as its element. All of us have God in His divine nature within us as a base according to our spiritual birth (2 Pet. 1:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Exclusively of the Redeeming Christ</H2><P>The New Jerusalem in its composition and constitution is exclusively of the redeeming Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In the Work of His All-inclusive Death<br>and His Life-supplying Resurrection</H2><P>The holy city is exclusively of the redeeming Christ in the work of His all-inclusive death and His life-supplying resurrection. His death is all-inclusive to solve all the problems, and His resurrection is supplying us with life all the time.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
