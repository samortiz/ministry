In this message we shall go on to consider the other signs in this chapter.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTED LAZARUS</h2><p>The next sign in John 12 is the sign of the resurrected Lazarus (vv. 1-2, 9-11). This sign is a testimony of resurrection life. Verse 9 says that the people came &#8220;that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from among the dead.&#8221; Lazarus was a living testimony of resurrection life.<p>Actually, Lazarus did not do anything; he simply was a testimony of resurrection life. Martha was serving, and Mary was expressing her love for the Lord. Lazarus, however, was simply reclining at the table with the Lord Jesus. The testimony of Lazarus became the center of people&#8217;s attention. As a testimony of resurrection life, Lazarus attracted others.<p>The principle is the same today in the church life. The most attracting factor in the church life is our testimony of resurrection life. For example, someone may testify to his relatives, &#8220;You know what kind of person I was. You could even say that I was dead and buried. But now I am a resurrected person.&#8221; Today the Lord does not mainly want us to do things for Him. He wants us to be His testimony, a testimony of resurrection life.<p>To some extent, people are moved by Mary&#8217;s love. They may look at this dear sister and appreciate her love for the Lord. But the church life is not centered on this love. The center of the church life is a living testimony of resurrection life. This testimony, of course, is not of the natural life, but of a resurrected life, a new life.<p>I wish to emphasize the fact that the center of the church life must be persons living no longer by the natural life, but living by resurrection life. It is not necessary for a resurrected person to do anything. He may simply recline at the table, and others will be satisfied to see him.<p>We should not think that any kind of religious service can attract others. Neither should we think that our love for the Lord will be the primary attraction. If our love is not a love that comes out of resurrection life, it will never be a means of attracting people. The central attraction, which is also the focus of the church life, is resurrection life. If we all live this resurrection life, we shall become those who attract others to the Lord.<p>Other people appreciate resurrection life. If a young person tries to tell his parents how much he loves the Lord, this may offend them. Parents want to see that their child is living a certain kind of life. Your parents may not care about religious service or even appreciate your love for the Lord. But they will appreciate the fact that you are living another life, a resurrection life, a life that has brought you out of the tomb. Therefore, resurrection life should be our focus.<p>Sometimes certain people have advised me to give messages on a particular subject. For the most part I respond to these suggestions by saying, &#8220;There is no need for me to give messages on these subjects, for many others are speaking on these things. However, many Christians do not pay any attention at all to resurrection life. For this reason, I am burdened to minister life to the Lord&#8217;s people.&#8221;<p>Because it is our burden to minister life, our Bible studies are called Life-studies. Many years ago we coined the term &#8220;life-study,&#8221; realizing that what the children of God need today is a life-study of the Word. Because God&#8217;s people need life, year after year we publish the Life-study Messages. It is not our intention to pass on mere Bible knowledge that will cause others to exercise their mentality. Our goal is to minister resurrection life from the written Word to God&#8217;s people. This is what we need. We need resurrection life.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_115.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_117.html">Next</a> </body></html>
