   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE SPIRIT BEING THE PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TRIUNE GOD WITHIN US Scripture Reading: Matt 1:23; 18:20; 28:20; John 14:17; Acts 9:31; Rom 8:14, 16; 9:1; 2 Tim 4:22; 2 Cor 13:14; Rev 1:4-5a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Timothy 1:4 speaks of "God's dispensation economy which is in faith."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's New Testament economy is altogether in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The divine facts in God's economy are great and real, but they require our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has accomplished everything necessary for the dispensing of the divine Trinity into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The only requirement now is that we exercise our faith to enjoy this dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The dispensing of the divine Trinity may be illustrated by the flow of water in the water pipes in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The water is always there, but how much the water flows depends on how much we turn on the faucets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The dispensing of the divine Trinity is a fact and a reality, but we must exercise our faith to say "amen" to this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to "turn on the faucet" by saying "amen" to the divine fact and enjoying the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's New Testament economy is by faith, not by appearance, and this faith is based upon the divine facts that have been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, many of the facts in the Bible are not presented in a plain and simple way, and there are many items, especially in the New Testament, that are difficult to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, many times we do not stand with the divine facts but prefer to exercise our feeling and natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, what we preach as the glad tidings, the good news, is that God has accomplished everything needed for His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Gospels the Lord said, "All things are ready; come to the marriage feast" Matt 22:4; Luke 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The feast of God's economy is already "cooked."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should simply come and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>RECEIVING WHAT GOD HAS ACCOMPLISHED</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>ACCORDING TO HIS TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has accomplished everything for His economy, and we have God's accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the book of Revelation, John speaks in the past tense.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that in God's eyes everything has been done.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also have the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has recorded what He has accomplished in a book.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, this book is a covenant and a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A covenant is an agreement with some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will with certain accomplished things bequeathed to the inheritor.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every page of the Bible is an item of the bequeathed inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A testament is a contract of bequeathed items, not of requirements for us to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a statement that tells us that whatever is written within it has been accomplished and is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we have to take what is in it and receive it by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first main item in the New Testament is that God was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Secondly, He lived a human life on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death as the Lamb of God John 1:29 , the brass serpent John 3:14 , and the grain of wheat John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He accomplished such an all-inclusive death, He solved the problem of our sins, sin, the flesh, the old man, and our worldliness, and He terminated Satan and death Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then He resurrected and ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After He accomplished all these things, He recorded what He had accomplished in His testament and passed this testament on to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many readers of the Bible think that they must accomplish what is written in it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we do not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everything has been done already; it is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we may not have this realization.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord's ministry today is not teaching the saints something we need to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is showing us that all the things that have been accomplished and consummated by God are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should simply see the facts, take them, stand with them, and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must believe that we have been filled with the Spirit within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must also believe that we have the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we go out to visit people for the gospel by knocking on their doors, we should not tremble.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not expect some outward evidence or experience to prove that we have Christ's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we question whether or not we have the authority of Christ, this indicates that we do not have the habit of faith.</S>
