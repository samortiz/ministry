   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the One chosen and beloved by Jehovah; He is the One in whom Jehovah delights. b.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With Jehovah's Spirit upon Him, Announcing Justice to the Gentiles</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matthew 12:18b goes on to say, "I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the Gentiles."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ had Jehovah's Spirit upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Christ was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him and abode upon Him as the economical power for His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With Jehovah's Spirit upon Him, He announced justice to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word justice here means "righteousness" or "righteous judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A righteous judgment is a decision for the right things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus proclaimed all the right decisions for the Gentiles. c.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not Striving nor Crying Out</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 12:19 says, "He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the Lord did not shout or make noise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of crying out to make His voice known in the streets, He was calm and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 19 indicates that, as the Servant of Jehovah, Christ was no longer free to minister openly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the contrary, because He had been rejected, He had to hide Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the context of Matthew 12 makes clear, the reason for the rejection and the cause of the Lord's hiding Himself was His breaking of the religious regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was due to the Lord's caring for His headship and for the members of His Body. d.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not Breaking the Bruised Reed nor Quenching the Smoking Flax</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew 12:20 continues, "A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ will not break a bruised reed nor quench smoking flax.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that while He was being rejected and opposed, He was still full of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who were opposing Him were like bruised reeds and smoking flax, but the Lord Jesus was still merciful toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Jews used to make flutes of reeds.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a reed was bruised, they broke it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They also made torches with flax to burn oil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the oil ran out, the flax smoked, and they quenched it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some of the Lord's people are like the bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Others are like the smoking flax that cannot give a shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet the Lord will not break the bruised ones nor quench the smoking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although the Lord was rejected, He was still merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even those who had become bruised reeds He would not break, and those who had become smoking flax He would not quench.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, He kept open to them the door of mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Among those who believe in the Lord Jesus today, many have become bruised reeds that can no longer give a musical sound.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a rule, the bruised reeds should be broken and thrown away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But Christ will not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, many of His believers no longer burn as a bright light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a rule, He should quench them all and cast them away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But He will not do this either.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead, as the merciful Servant of Jehovah, He would use some of those who are as bruised reeds and smoking flax to bring forth justice unto victory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we think that no one is useful except ourselves, we cannot carry out the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord would select some bruised reeds and smoking flax.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He would perfect them so that they could become useful in His hand to bring forth justice unto victory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No matter how much He is opposed, He, the Servant of Jehovah, is still merciful.</S>
