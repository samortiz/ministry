   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE IN MOTIVE AND FEELING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must see something more concerning the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the appreciation of Christ, there is another kind of difference.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only is there a difference in size, but also a difference in feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some peace offerings are offered as a thanksgiving, and some are offered for a voluntary vow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"And of it he shall present one cake out of each offering for a heave offering unto the Lord, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is presented; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he presenteth his sacrifice; and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten" Lev 7:14-16, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>. Those who offer the peace offering for thanksgiving are very thankful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord has been very good to them, and they are grateful and thankful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, they bring to the Lord a peace offering for thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But let me ask a question: Do you think that this kind of offering is very strong in feeling?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe that most of you might say yes, but I say no. This is the weakest feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For me to bring a peace offering to the Lord because He has been so good to me is more or less like making a bargain with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Jacob was young, he made a bargain with the Lord like this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He told the Lord that if He would provide for his eating, his clothing, his housing, and protection, then he would do certain things for the Lord Gen 28:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is easy to be thankful to the Lord when He is so good to you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But suppose the Lord is not so good to you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How would you feel then?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some may get a better job, some a better home, some a better car, and some a better degree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything is better all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then they will be very thankful to the Lord, and they will come to the meeting with a peace offering for thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a feeling in this peace offering, but it is not a very strong feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose that when you look for a better home, you eventually get one that is worse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And when you look for a better job, you don't find it, and instead, you lose your present job.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What would you do then?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Could you still come to the meeting with a peace offering?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I don't think so.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You simply will not have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But there is another kind of peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a peace offering for a voluntary vow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who give this offering do not care whether the Lord gives them a better home or not.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In fact, they don't care whether the Lord gives them anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are just here for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a vow to them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The heavens and the earth can flee away, but they are still for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Undoubtedly, this kind of feeling is very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times in the meetings, we hear these two kinds of peace offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some offer a peace offering of thanksgiving by saying, "Praise the Lord, He is so good to me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I only expected to get a job paying 400.00 a month, but now I have one that pays 550.00 a month."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes, on the other hand, we hear some of the saints say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We don't care for this and we don't care for that!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are just here for the Lord's recovery!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lord, what a mercy that we could be here for You!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a vow, and it is voluntary.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may lose our job, we may lose many things, yet we are so strong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The peace offering for thanksgiving is only good to eat for one day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It cannot last longer; it immediately becomes old.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Hallelujah, I have a better car, and the Lord gave me such a good home.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I did not ask for this much, but He gave it to me."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of offering is only fresh for the present meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Tomorrow it will be old.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After we have told the church that the Lord gave us such a good job, we cannot repeat it tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we repeat it again tomorrow, no one will listen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It will stink because it is too old.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But a peace offering of a vow is good for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can repeat it the next day, and we can repeat it again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, the peace offering for thanksgiving is much weaker than the peace offering for the voluntary vow.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The voluntary vow is stronger and lasts longer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The difference is in our motive and in our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What kind of motive do we have when we bring Christ into the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do we only have the motive of thanksgiving, or do we have the motive of a vow?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We all must learn to bring Christ to the meeting for a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Regardless of whether or not He would do anything for us, we are still for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even if He puts us in prison as He did John the Baptist, we will still praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>John was very strong in testifying for Christ, but when he was put into prison, he sent his disciples to ask the Lord if He was really the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In other words, he was saying that if Jesus were really the Christ, He would get him out of prison.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But the Lord Jesus told John's disciples to tell John that He did many things for the blind and the lame, but He would not do one thing for him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He added that John will be blessed if he is not offended.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we would be offended when the Lord treats us in this way, then we could only offer a peace offering for thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We could never offer a peace offering for a vow.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Suppose a young sister who has been hoping for a baby boy for a number of years finally has her "Isaac."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I do believe that this young mother will bring a peace offering of thanksgiving to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But suppose that after six months, the Lord takes away her "Isaac."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Will this sister still bring a peace offering of thanksgiving to the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I am afraid that it will be a weeping offering.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we are here simply for the Lord to do something for us, we can only offer the peace offering of thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But if we are here for the Lord, with a voluntary vow for His purpose, we do have a strong motive to bring as a peace offering to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This offering always lasts longer.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Together with this point, there is another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the presentation of the peace offering, we always need to offer something new and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should not offer the peace offering which we offered yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need something new for today.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Every day we need some new experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We all must realize that it is not so good to apply our old appreciations of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is really poor to apply what we experienced two months ago, and it is also not good to apply something of yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We always need some fresh and new peace offerings.</S>
