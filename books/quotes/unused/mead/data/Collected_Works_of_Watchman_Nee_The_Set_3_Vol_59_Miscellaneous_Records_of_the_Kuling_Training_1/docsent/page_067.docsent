   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING AT PEACE TO SUBMIT TO DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since God dares to commit Himself to the deputy authority, we should dare to submit ourselves to the same.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God puts His trust in all the masters, parents, husbands, and men in position.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He does not say that we should submit only to the half that are good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If that is the case, we may choose to take the other half, to whom we think we owe no submission.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since God was at peace to use a man such as Saul, David was at peace to submit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Saul's behavior before God was God's business; David's attitude was simply one of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether or not Moses and Aaron were wrong in how they behaved is not for me to know; all I need to know is that they were God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the Israelites needed to know was that Moses and Aaron were deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That should have been enough for them to practice submission.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Israelites had a complaint, they did not argue with God; they did not say that God was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, they said that Moses and Aaron were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Israelites rebelled against Moses and Aaron, however, God said that they were rebelling against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Where authority is present, God upholds this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Where authority is absent, God appoints authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First God appoints authority, and then He upholds authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether or not a deputy authority is wrong is nobody else's business, but if I am wrong in my attitude, I have to bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to learn to have the courage to submit to deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God never argues with us about the rights and wrongs of the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He only charges us to take care of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God took care of Saul's right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to be responsible for how we behave.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If God did not have trust in such a man, He would not have appointed him in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a serious thing for God to entrust Himself to man unconditionally.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people entrust themselves to others conditionally.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, a man may entrust another person with his money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He may say that the other person can use his money as long as the amount is under a hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if the amount is exceeded by one dollar, he should check before spending it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a conditional trust, but God entrusts His authority to man absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a great thing to entrust someone with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to believe that God has entrusted Himself to His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He will surely honor the authority He has appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to our rebellious nature, we are happy only to submit to God's direct authority; we have no respect for His appointed deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people think that they can submit as long as they can set aside God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet ninety percent of all authorities are deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God has no qualm about entrusting Himself to these deputy authorities, we should have no qualm in submitting to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since the Lord is happy to commission men to be His authority, we should be happy to submit to these commissioned authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>GOD HONORING THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us consider again the ordinance regarding the taking of a vow in Numbers 30 and see how God honors deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the entire chapter, only verse 2 speaks about man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From verse 3 onward, the subject is the vow of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The woman is under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before she is married, she is her father's daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After she is married, she is her husband's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Prior to her marriage, her father is her authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After she is married, her husband is her authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No man or woman can revoke his or her vow before the Lord; a person must carry out his or her vow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is God's direct commandment; it relates to God's direct authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The woman has an added consideration; she is under an indirect authority her father or her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The father or husband is a woman's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is an authority appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a girl makes a vow at home before she is married, this vow has to be approved by her father before God will recognize it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It seems as if God is saying that in order for a woman to submit to God's authority, she must first submit to His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the father objects to the vow, God will not acknowledge it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If He acknowledged it, He would be overturning His own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God honors His own deputy authority, which He appointed Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the deputy authority approves it, the direct Authority endorses it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the deputy authority does not approve it, the direct Authority will not endorse it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The whole chapter is on this one matter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After a woman is married, she is under the authority of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As long as her husband does not approve a vow, God will not hold the wife accountable for it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God only requires that the wife submit to the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the New Testament a man cannot say that he has made a gift to God of what is due to his parents and, therefore, has no further obligation to honor his parents Matt 15:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God says that we should honor our father and mother v. 4 . A man cannot overturn God's deputy authority; he cannot make an excuse by saying that he is submitting to God's direct authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God says that if a person does not submit to deputy authority, his vows will not be honored by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the same way, after a woman is married, the vow she makes in the presence of and with the consent of her husband is acknowledged.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the husband does not consent to it, God will annul the vow.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the husband dies and the woman remarries, the same submission applies to the second husband; he is the deputy authority, inasmuch as God is the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Here we find God establishing His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What should we do when the deputy authority makes a mistake?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Numbers 30:15 says that if a husband makes null and void the vows and pledges of his wife after he has heard them, he will have to bear her iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If a deputy authority makes a mistake, we do not have to bear any responsibility for his mistake; he has to bear the responsibility of the iniquity himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God only requires obedience from the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In this chapter of Scripture, God shows us that He will not allow a person to overstep His appointed deputy authority even if it is under the pretense of obeying God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We cannot say that since we have received a command from God, we will obey God only and do not need to take heed to the command of the elders or the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If the husband is wrong, he must bear not only his own sin but the sin of his wife as well.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, we have to learn to be a deputy authority ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A deputy authority has to learn to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we are wrong, we must bear not only our own sin but the sin of misguiding others.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The entire New Testament upholds the place of deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the Gospels we find Christ exercising submission when He answered the high priest who questioned Him in the name of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In Acts we find Paul doing the same thing when he faced Ananias the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The only portion in the New Testament where we find an exception to this rule is when Peter testified concerning the resurrected Christ and the Sanhedrin tried to stop him from preaching in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Peter and the other apostles answered, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men" Acts 5:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The authority of the Sanhedrin was also a deputy authority, and it was right for the Jews to obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But in this case, the Sanhedrin was clearly acting contrary to God's authority by rejecting the Lord's name and forbidding the apostles from preaching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The apostles could not go along with this.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Only under such circumstances were they allowed to say, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Other than this, a person should not rebel against God's deputy authority under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We cannot be careless in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We cannot practice rebellion under the pretense of obeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We cannot rebel against the deputy authority while claiming that we are obeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What a solemn matter deputy authority is!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God's authority is established successively step by step through submission in each step.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We cannot disobey our parents while claiming that we are obeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When a person rebels against deputy authority, he is rebelling against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have to learn to identify God's deputy authorities, and we have to learn to honor them, uphold them, and build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must obey deputy authority, and we must eradicate the spirit of rebellion in us.</S>
