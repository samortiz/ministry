 <h1 class="msg">CONSECRATION</h1>
<p>After a person is saved, if he desires to grow in life and to allow God to do a thorough work on him, he must consecrate himself to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE BASIS OF CONSECRATION&mdash;<br />
THE REDEMPTION OF GOD</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;You are not your own...For you were bought with a price.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Corinthians 6:19-20</p>
<p>The Lord shed His priceless blood on the cross to purchase you. Therefore, you belong to Him.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But now, having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God...&rdquo;</strong> Romans 6:22</p>
<p>When we were saved, God redeemed us from under the curse of the law. We were rescued from the hand of Satan, from sin, from the world, and from death.</p>
<p>Consecration is our recognition of God&rsquo;s legal claim on us, giving God the right that is due Him.</p>
<p>Hence, it is reasonable that we consecrate ourselves to God. This is our &ldquo;most reasonable service&rdquo; (Rom. 12:1).</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE MOTIVE OF CONSECRATION&mdash;<br />
THE LOVE OF GOD</h2>
<p>1. THE CONSTRAINING OF LOVE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For the love of Christ constrains us, having judged this, that One died on behalf of all; therefore all died; and He died on behalf of all, that those who live may no longer live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and has been raised.&rdquo;</strong>  2 Corinthians 5:14-15</p>
<p>The love which Christ exhibited in His substitutionary death is our motivating power; it constrains us to live to Him.</p>
<p>2. THE BESEECHING OF LOVE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 12:1</p>
<p>3. THE CALLING OF LOVE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Jesus said to Simon Peter...do you love Me more than these?&rdquo;</strong>  John 21:15</p>
<p>The Lord often asks within us, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than the world? Do you love Me more than knowledge, fame, parents, wife, and children?&rdquo; Who can resist His love?</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE INCENTIVE<br />
TO CONSECRATION&mdash;<br />
THE REVELATION OF GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">(1) Seeing the Eternal Purpose<br />
of God in the Universe, Resulting<br />
in Our Giving Ourselves to It</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 3:10</p>
<p>When Paul saw the purpose of God, he gave himself willingly to be the prisoner of Christ Jesus (Eph. 3:1).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, when Nehemiah saw the will of God, he strove to do a good work even unto death (Neh. 2:18; 6:11).</p>
<h2 class="head2">(2) Seeing the Preciousness<br />
of the Lord, Resulting in Our Life-long Commitment to Him</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.&rdquo;</strong>  John 6:68</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ.&rdquo;</strong>  Philippians 3:8</p>
<h2 class="head2">(3) Seeing the Coming Glory,<br />
Resulting in Our Willingness<br />
to Suffer and to Sacrifice for Him</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Jesus...for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame.&rdquo;</strong> Hebrews 12:2</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE MEANING OF CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>Consecration is not to donate money, to become a preacher, or to work for the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>1. It is to hand over our rights to God and to have God rule over us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. It is to offer ourselves as a sacrifice to God for His satisfaction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Present your bodies a living sacrifice.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 12:1</p>
<p>A consecrated person is like a bullock or a lamb that is offered on the altar:</p>
<p class="indent1">his <strong>position</strong> is changed, and<br />
his <strong>use</strong> is changed.</p>
<p>Formerly, he was in his own hand, for his own use.</p>
<p>Now he is in God&rsquo;s hand, for God&rsquo;s use.</p>
<p>This makes him a sweet-smelling savor,<br />
a sacrifice well-pleasing to God,<br />
to satisfy God.</p>
