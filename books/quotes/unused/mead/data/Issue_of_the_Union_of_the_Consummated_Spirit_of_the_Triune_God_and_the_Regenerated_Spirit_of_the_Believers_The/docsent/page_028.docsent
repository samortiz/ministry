   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Actually, a Christian is not single-natured but dual-natured.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ has divinity and humanity; He is God yet man, God plus man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A Christian has humanity and divinity; he is man yet God, man plus God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, from the beginning Brother Nee did not agree to translate the word Christian into Chinese as "Christ-disciple."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said that we should translate it as "Christ-man."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A Christ-man is one who has both the divine nature and the human nature, one who is a man yet has two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are a dual-natured entity man yet God; hence, we are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since we are God-men, our living is not merely the living of God but also the living of human beings; it is not merely the living of human beings but also the living of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The redeemed people in the Body of Christ are those who are regenerated to be man yet God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We who are regenerated by God will become God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some people do not agree with this kind of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, I must say that once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, He is regenerated, born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is his Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the Father is God, the children also should be God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sheep beget sheep; horses beget horses.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, God begets God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>John 1:12-13 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten...of God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word strongly indicates that the believers of the Lord are God's children, who are born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is born of God is God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps there are some who say that although we are born of God, we are still men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To this I must say that although the Lord Jesus is God who became a man, He is still God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we are men who become God, we are still men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus is God who became a man, but He did not lose His divinity; He is still God, and hence, He is God yet man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we, the saved ones, are men who become God, but we have not discarded our human nature; we are still men, and hence, we are man yet God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the fact and the truth, and it is logical.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We, the saved ones, are not merely forgiven of our sins; we are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be regenerated is to be born a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our first birth was of our parents, who are humans; hence, we also are humans.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we are regenerated, born of God the Father; hence, we also are God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our second birth was of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since we are born of God, surely we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The children of God surely are God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By our first birth we became man; by our second birth we become God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a person in his second birth is still only a man, he has not been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our second birth we are born of God, and what is born of God surely is God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, today we are not merely men but men yet God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are children of men, and also children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A man has begotten me; thus, I am a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has begotten me; thus, I am God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By our two births we have become men yet God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is irrefutable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have been stressing the fact that we are men yet God because this has too much to do with our living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, the children of a president are prudent in their speech and careful in their actions because they recognize their status.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A person who is born of God should not forget his status as a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have really seen this matter, there will always be a reminder within us: "Would a son of God speak in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Would he dress in this way?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one who really recognizes that he is a son of God could ever live and act by his own desires.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can testify that when I went to a department store, each time I picked up a necktie, there was a reminder within me saying, "I am a child of God who speaks for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Can I use this tie?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Often I just put down the necktie because I knew that I could not use it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers and sisters, do not forget your status.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the prince of a royal family forgot his status, that would be very unfortunate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since we are men yet God, our living should match our status.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must live the life of one who is man yet God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only when we live the life of one who is man yet God can the Body of Christ be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should never think that the Body of Christ is worked out by man's labor; neither should we think that the Body of Christ can be built up by good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The building up of the Body of Christ depends on the living that is the mingling of two natures the divine nature and the human nature that is, the co-living of two parties the One who is God yet man and those who are man yet God blended together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This kind of joined and mingled living will cause the Body of Christ to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, the building up of the Body of Christ is the issue of the co-living and co-walking of God and man through the union and mingling of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In actuality, this kind of co-living and co-walking is the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, this kind of building requires the participating God, in His resurrected and uplifted humanity, to co-live and co-walk with the participating men.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the other hand, this kind of building also requires the participating men, in their redeemed and resurrected humanity, to experience the co-death with Christ so that the attributes of the participating God can be manifested from within the participating men in resurrection to be their virtues.</S>
