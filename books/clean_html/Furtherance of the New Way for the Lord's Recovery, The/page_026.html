<h2 class=head2>Two Ways—Praying and Singing</h2><p>There are two “tools” for leading a home meeting: the Word and the Spirit. There are also two ways for leading a home meeting: praying and singing. Concerning praying, we should pray as soon as we enter the meeting and also lead others to pray; however, we should not pray in a routine or perfunctory way. Concerning singing, we may not have any musical ability and are out of tune when we sing, but this is not important. What is important is that we must sing. Praying and singing are two ways necessary for leading the home meetings.<p>There is a secret to these two ways. The secret is that we must be “crazy” in our spirit (cf. 2 Cor. 5:13; Acts 26:24-25). We must be “crazy” when we pray and “crazy” when we sing. When we go out to lead the home meetings, we must be a “crazy” person. Like someone who is drunk, we are full of new wine and filled with the Holy Spirit. This requires us to be those who pray and praise all the time. Do not care about or be limited by the circumstances. For example, sometimes when we visit a home, there are only little children there. This is not a problem. We can lead them to sing, “Since Jesus came into my heart,” while we wait for the mother to come home. If her face is not too happy when she returns, we should not be affected. On the contrary, we should be filled in spirit and sing, “O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore.” Thus, we will be able to minister to them through singing.<p>You should know that a person with the leading and presence of the Holy Spirit is like “one who is beside himself.” When we are “crazy” and “drunk” in spirit, the Holy Spirit will be with us. If we are not at all filled with the Holy Spirit and are like old men sitting as stable as a great mountain, then the Holy Spirit will have no way to do anything. The Holy Spirit has no way to move those who are immovable and rigid. Only those who are open can be moved by the Holy Spirit. Whether a meeting is living or dead totally depends on whether we are living or dead. If we are living and beside ourselves, even a dead meeting will become living because of us.<p>We must be those who are “crazy” in spirit in order to lead others to be “crazy” in spirit. If we want to help people not to be formal in prayer, then we must pray “crazy” prayers instead of conventional prayers. We must be like Paul, who was like a “pest” and a “plague” and was able to stir people up and “infect” them (Acts 24:5). Our whole being must be full of “germs,” so that when we contact people, we immediately “infect” them with the “germs” and make them “crazy” too. If we are this kind of person, when we lead the home meetings, we will make others this kind of person also. This is to escape from the degradation of Christianity and to completely repudiate the degraded customs of Christianity. In this way the home meetings will be full of the enjoyment of God and the presence of the Lord.<h2 class=head1>PERFECTING IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2><p>God gave the natural world a law of “each after its own kind” (cf. Gen. 1:11-25). If we are white, our children will look like us; and if we are black, our children will also look like us. It is unusual for parents to give birth to a child that does not look like them. If we possess certain characteristics, then we cannot avoid passing them on to our children. In the same principle, we will cause the people whom we are caring for to be the same as we are. If we love the Lord and His word, if we are always filled with the Holy Spirit—praying and singing livingly and crazily—then when we go to lead the home meetings, we will certainly cause people to be supplied and to love the Lord. As a result, the world will spontaneously fall away from them and they will not want anything other than the Lord and His word.<p>Therefore, when we go to lead a home meeting, we should have these four items—the Lord’s Word, the Holy Spirit, praying, and singing—as our foundation. We should be acquainted with the Word, be rich in the Word, and have a thorough understanding of the Word. We should be constantly, richly filled and overflowing with the Spirit. We should pray and sing in a crazy and living way. The Word, the Spirit, praying, and singing are four keys to leading the home meetings. The Word and the Spirit are “tools,” while praying and singing are ways. The Word and the Spirit are the base, while praying and singing are the expression.<h2 class=head1>OVERTURNING OUR CONCEPT BEING NECESSARY FOR EVANGELIZATION</h2><p>However, we do not only emphasize ways and techniques; rather, through these ways and techniques we are overturning everyone’s concepts to rid ourselves of all that is old, even old feelings, flavors, and thoughts, until we are inwardly filled with the home meetings. We use home meetings to preach the gospel, speak the truth, and feed others. We pray and break bread in the homes in order to make the home meetings the practical church life. If our concept is completely changed, if, according to the principle we set forth, we produce a full-timer for every twenty saints and a weekly door-knocker for every four saints, and if all the saints continue to support and give their all to preach the gospel house to house, then I believe that within three to five years we can produce a completely new generation. This could comprise more than ten thousand households and sixty or seventy thousand new ones who meet regularly and who go everywhere preaching the gospel and teaching the truth. This will bring in a genuine great revival.<p>Door-knocking to preach the gospel is not only the God-ordained way but also the best way according to the needs of human society. Man is a social creature, and every human being likes to be part of a group, but it is not easy to find a good and proper social group. The church is the best “society” because we give people salvation and the Lord as life. This brings great blessing to a person’s family. Today one of the greatest problems in American families is that many of the young people, including junior high and elementary school students, take drugs. However, by the Lord’s preserving, this problem is almost non-existent among the children of our brothers and sisters in the church because they receive the protection of the truth. The Chinese proverb says, “He who nears vermilion becomes red; he who nears ink becomes black.” This is a natural outcome. This is also why we continually emphasize that the household is the unit for receiving blessings. We must stress the home meetings.<p>I believe that the day will come when the gospel will not be preached just by those of us who are here; instead, it will be preached by all the brothers and sisters because everyone will be able to preach effectively and the rate of increase will be high. In the meetings it will not be just a few people who are functioning, but everyone will be full of the Lord’s Word and the Spirit and will function in a living and fresh way. This is true evangelization.
