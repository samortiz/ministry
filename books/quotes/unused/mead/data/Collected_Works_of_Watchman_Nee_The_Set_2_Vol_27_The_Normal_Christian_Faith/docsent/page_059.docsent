   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GLAD TIDINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our gospel is also called the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why is it called the glad tidings?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is it because the Bible contains commandments that have a higher standard than all other religions?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If so, then we are preaching grievous tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a physical fitness test, if the requirement is only to jump a foot, everyone can easily pass.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if the requirement is ten feet, then we have a grievous tiding.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is the glad tiding that God gave us?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the bestowing of His Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By His resurrection we are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now He is living inside of us to be our life, so that we may live Him out and fulfill His demands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the glad tiding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The glad tiding is that God is fulfilling His own commandments inside of us!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The gospel is not a set of do's and don'ts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You do not have to crawl around the earth day and night like crabgrass, telling yourself over and over again that you are not supposed to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not a glad tiding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a grievous tiding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The gospel is that God is coming into us to live and obey for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>HE MAKES US ABLE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only do we have to see that we are unable; we have to realize that God is able!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Luke 18:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The young ruler only saw that he was unable and concluded that God was the same and proceeded to leave sorrowfully.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But God is able!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not think that when you are unable everything is over with you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The inability of man is the beginning of the ability of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the time for God to show forth His power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not that we are able, but His doing a work for us makes us able.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The meaning of Christ being our life is this: formerly man lived by his own life, but the natural life is ousted by the coming in of the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The "I" who formerly lived is gone, and the life of Christ comes in to take its place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then it is no longer I who live.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the life within is exchanged, the behavior without cannot remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because our life is Christ, we can fulfill Christ's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not the power of Christ helping us to conform to His ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, it is the life of Christ substituting ours to live out His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When His life inside is working, we can keep His laws.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE OLD COVENANT A FAILURE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to look at one passage carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hebrews 8:8-9 says, "For finding fault with them He says, Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.'"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How did God establish His covenant with the children of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did so by taking them by the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The laws were written on stone tablets.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were outward.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The result was that the children of Israel did not continue in God's covenant, and God did not regard them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's commandments are one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our obeying is another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The result of that whole experiment was a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE NEW COVENANT WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now let us look at the second covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hebrews 8:10 and 11 say, "For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me. And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now the law is put within man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is no longer inscribed on stones, nor is it recorded merely in the Bible; it is written upon our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is the good of having the law put inside of us?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ezekiel 36:27 says, "And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Please note the word "cause."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is a strong word in the Hebrew language.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The result of God's putting His Spirit within us is to cause us to be able to obey His ordinances and walk in His statutes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Under the old covenant, man had to struggle to obey God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now the Spirit of God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He causes us to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hitherto God gave the commandments, and we supplied our own strength for their fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now the commanding One is God, but the supplying One becomes God also.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After resurrection, Christ came into us to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The result is that we are enabled to fulfill God's commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ's sufficiency has become our ability.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because Christ is living for us, all the problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I AM CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I turn the question now to you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Have you given up hope in yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Are you still trying to improve yourself and reform to a better status?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have completely abandoned any hope in myself!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>My goodness and wickedness alike are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now everything is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do you believe that God has crucified you?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do you believe that your old man is nullified and that Christ is in you?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If so, you have to substantiate all these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then you will be able to say that henceforth it is Christ living in you.</S>
