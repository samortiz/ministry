   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Practical Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning John s accusation in this item, we must distinguish Christianity from the Christians and the genuine church that is according to the divine revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 13 the Lord Jesus showed us clearly in His parables the difference between the wheat the real Christians and the tares the nominal Christians , the difference between meal fine flour Christ as food to God and men and leaven evil things such as heresies, false teachings, and evil practices , the difference between the mustard seed Christ as the seed of life and a big tree the abnormal development of the church Christianity , and the difference between the tares, leaven, and the abnormally developed tree, and the treasure hidden in the field the kingdom of the heavens and the pearl of great value the genuine church .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The nominal Christians, the heresies, the evil practices, and the abnormal development have transmuted the church, which is composed of the genuine Christians and Christ as the seed of life and the spiritual food to be the precious pearl and the hidden treasure, into Christianity, which is not acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today, for the Lord s recovery, we must realize the difference between the genuine church, composed of the real Christians, and the abnormal Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we say Poor Christianity! we refer to the abnormal Christianity, with no intention of belittling or despising any real Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do recognize real Christians as our beloved brothers and sisters in Christ and respect those among them who are seeking the Lord and His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we cannot justify the very Christianity of which they are members and for which they work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, in the Lord s recovery, quite often in teaching the saints we must present the truth concerning the genuine church of the Lord as His organic Body by pointing out the poor situation of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We prefer to speak about others in a positive way, but in today s abnormal situation we simply cannot avoid pointing out the abnormality that exists among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>14.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Dissenting Accusation</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>an Overstressing and Distortion of the Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>concerning Deputy Authority</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There has been to some extent an atmosphere of fear brought in among the saints and among the churches, bringing the conscience of the saints into bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe this has been done by an over-stressing and distortion of the teaching concerning deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This has brought the saints into a condition where they are fearful to follow their conscience, to be one with their spirit, and sometimes to speak their genuine concerns.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Practical Truth</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John s word here is an accusation against the teaching of deputy authority in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the divine revelation in the holy Word, there is deputy authority in God s economy, both in the Old Testament, such as with Moses and the priests who taught the people the divine oracle, and in the New Testament, such as with the elders, who take care of the church 1 Tim 3:5; 5:17; Heb 13:17 , and the apostles, who establish the churches and teach the saints 2 Cor 10:8; 13:10; 1 Cor 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A local church is under the authority of Christ as the Head, represented by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the saints in a local church should obey the elders Heb 13:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The churches as the Body of Christ are under their Head, Christ, represented by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the churches should obey the apostles 2 Cor 2:9; 7:15; 10:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To obey the elders in a local church and to obey the apostles among the churches does not mean that the obeying one does not need to obey the Lord directly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he is seeking the leading directly from the Lord, he should also take care of the elders in the local church, because he is living and working in the church as a part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the churches are seeking the leading directly from the Lord, they should also take care of the apostles, because they are all living and working with the apostles in the churches as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether in a local church or among all the churches, we should be Body-conscious, taking care not only of the Head but also of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since we are living and working in the Body, we have the Body with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot have the Head without the Body; neither can we have the Body without the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should seek to obey the Head with a relationship to the Body, and we should also seek to obey the Body with a relationship to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all need to realize that in our natural life we are very independent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So, to take care of obeying both the Lord and the elders or the apostles at the same time is not an easy thing for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, we may unconsciously feel that the teaching concerning the obeying of God s deputy authority is overly stressed or even unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In any case, to say that there is no deputy authority of the Lord is surely unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fear within those who are not willing to obey the elders in a local church or the apostles in the churches might, according to their feeling, bring their conscience into bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Any kind of fear that causes the saints to feel bound in their conscience and not free to do whatever they feel led of the Lord is not needed or healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a fear might be due to the saints independence, or to their unwillingness to be one with the elders, or to their holding of a view concerning the church life which is different from the view held generally by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If it is due to the saints independence, then the saints need to learn how to live the Body life; if it is due to the saints unwillingness to be one with the elders, then they need to learn more concerning how to be in one accord with the elders in the church life; if they are holding a different view than the church s view, then they need to learn more lessons that they may go along with the church or the churches in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regardless of what the fear is due to, it is always better to obey the elders in a church or the apostles among the churches at the same time as one obeys the Lord, rather than to obey only the Lord without caring for the elders in the church or the apostles among the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the saints need to be ushered into a Body-consciousness and to be helped to pay the price of the giving up of their independence, their freedom to be different, and their subjective view, so that the Body of Christ can be built up in the Lord s way.</S>
