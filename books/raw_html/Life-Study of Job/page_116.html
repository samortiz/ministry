<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. To Empty the Bible Readers' Spirit<br>That They May Have More Room in Their Spirit<br>to Gain God in His Riches More and More</H2><P>In addition, the book of Job functions to empty the Bible readers' spirit that they may have more room in their spirit to gain God in His riches more and more, to gain God more than anything else.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. To Serve the Bible Readers with a Capacity<br>to Understand the Secrets in the Psalms</H2><P>Finally, the book of Job functions to serve the Bible readers with a capacity to understand the secrets of the next book, the Psalms. If we come to the Psalms without reading the book of Job, we will be lacking part of the background necessary for understanding the secrets in the Psalms.</P><P>We have seen that our principle in this study of Job is to study this book according to what is revealed in the Bible as a whole. If we come to the book of Job without the proper understanding of the divine revelation in the entire Scriptures, this book will not mean very much to us, and we will not understand the goal of God's dealing with Job.</P><P>Some readers of Job know about his patience and endurance (James 5:10-11) and about the material blessing Job received at the end, but they do not know either what it means to see God or what God's intention was in His appearing to Job. Regarding God's dealing with Job, there were certain mysterious things, and these things are to some extent unveiled in the Psalms. For a complete unveiling we need to come to the New Testament to see the revelation concerning Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension to produce the church as the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</P>
