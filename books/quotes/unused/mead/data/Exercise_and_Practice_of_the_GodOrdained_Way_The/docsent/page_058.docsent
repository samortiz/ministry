   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE SEVENTEEN FOUR CRUCIAL PRACTICES OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading: 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Reading the Bible 2 Tim 3:15-16 2.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praying Always 1 Thes 5:17-18 3.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Keeping Morning Watch Psa 119:147-148 4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Attending the Meetings Heb 10:25 BEING RELEASED FOR THE LORD'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the way to care for the new believers in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To have successful home meetings is not easy; it depends entirely upon our actions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we do something as a part of the Lord's work, we must be released persons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must also be persons who can cause others to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As descendants of Adam, all the people on this earth are under some kind of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, in touching the work of the Lord, we cannot be people under bondage; we must be fully released.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we go to visit a new one's home to have a home meeting, yet we are not released, this can be very damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We all have to learn to get ourselves fully released from every kind of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are many things that come to us to bind and oppress us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this respect, we are very weak and fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A small thing can easily bind us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While a brother is driving to a new one's home for a home meeting, one of his team members may say something about his driving.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This little word about his driving will make him unhappy and bind him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In married life it is difficult to be released because small things can easily cause offenses, and to be offended is to be bound.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before going to visit a home, you may receive a phone call that causes you to become bound.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may feel and realize that you are bound and even pray, "O Lord, release me," but many times your prayer would not be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then when you enter the home, outwardly you may shout and rejoice, but inwardly you are not released.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Devil knows you are bound, your spirit knows you are bound, and even the new ones will realize that something within you is not so pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Your being bound can kill the home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of what you would say, preach, or teach, it would not work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, to work for the Lord effectively, you must be a released person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many years ago while I was in Shanghai, Brother Watchman Nee stressed this point very much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He told us that we should never open any letters shortly before speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I would open a letter before speaking, I might be damaged and lose my effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even to look at the sender's name and address might bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brother Nee also said that when we are about to speak, we should not accept any phone calls.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many times as I am picking up my books to come to the meeting, the phone will ring.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Should I answer it or not?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These things are quite bothering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another bothering factor can be our children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are about to go to speak for the Lord, something will happen related to our children that will bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is easy to see how fragile we are.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many things in our circumstances, in our environment, and in our situation come to us with the intention of destroying our spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why it is hard to find anyone on this earth who is fully released, without any kind of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot avoid people completely.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to contact others, and the more we contact others, the more bothering factors we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All of us are surrounded by bothering factors.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can we learn not to be bothered?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This lesson is endless; we will continue to learn it until we meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My burden in this message is to make one basic lesson clear to all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Regardless of how much training you receive concerning the home meetings, you must first learn how to get yourselves released.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is possible to do nearly everything under bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you are under bondage, you can still teach in a classroom or you can still learn as a student.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, in touching the spiritual work, as long as you are not released, you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The subtle enemy that damages our work is the one who bothers us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once we become bothered, we are not released, but bound.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then our work becomes fruitless.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For our work in the home meetings, we all must learn to keep ourselves always in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should never get out of the spirit to deal with things in our environment or situation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must preserve ourselves in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is also good to try not to get involved in troubling situations.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once you are involved with anything, it is easy to become bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the negative side, we must learn not to get ourselves involved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the positive side, we must preserve, or keep, ourselves in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then even if someone says something to us concerning our driving, we would not care, we would not be interested in getting involved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The problem is that we are too sensitive and always want to be involved in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some like to know everything and are always hunting for information.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we are like this, we are through with the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Bible tells us that while the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He was deaf and blind Isa 42:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was not actually deaf and blind, but He simply would not hear or see.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sometimes I go places and actually see many things, but I do not care for or pay attention to those things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead, I might be considering a certain chapter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, when I return I do not remember many of the things that I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I believe the Lord Jesus' eyes were very sharp, but He would not look upon so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In that sense, He did not see; He was blind.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this same sense, He was also deaf.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He did not see and He did not hear, so He did not become involved in so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must realize that we might be persons who are involved in too many things.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some can be among us for only a few days and already be involved in more things than I am.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Such persons cannot carry out the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We all must learn not to get ourselves involved with others or in others' situations.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must be those who know only the Lord and nothing else.</S>
