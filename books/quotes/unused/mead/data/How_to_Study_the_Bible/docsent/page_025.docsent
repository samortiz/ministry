   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Moving from Sameness in Quality to Increase in Capacity</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Holy Spirit is matching our spirit with the spirit of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This refers to a match in quality, not to a match in capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spirit of the Lord Jesus is thousands of times greater than our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the only begotten Son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sameness in quality means that we have a little share in the spirit that He possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are the same in kind, but they are not the same in degree.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the discipline of the Holy Spirit can carry us further, from just a qualitative matching of our spirit with the spirit of the Bible to an actual increase in the capacity in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord increases the capacity of our spirit with His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This involves a process that goes on continuously like feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today the Lord dispenses something to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tomorrow He will dispense more things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the dispensing increases, the capacity of our spirit increases.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we begin to understand the Bible, we begin the process of feeding, and as we are fed, our capacity increases.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The starting point in our understanding of the Bible is a matching in the quality of the spirits, while the consummate issue of our understanding of the Bible is an increase in the capacity of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose a man has a terrible temper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He cannot read God's Word no matter how hard he tries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After God disciplines him, he will have a little patience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This patience is not the result of a conscious effort on his part, nor is it a kind of manmade endurance; it is the spontaneous result of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After he acquires this kind of spirit, his reading of God's Word will result in the ministration of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's word will supply his spirit and enrich it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He will receive more and more, and his capacity will increase little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit first brings a man's spirit into harmony with the spirit of the Bible as far as the quality is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then there can be an increase in capacity as well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This increase in capacity comes from the discipline of the Holy Spirit through the environment, as well as through the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Holy Spirit does the breaking work through His discipline in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time, through the words of the Scripture, He brings us the supply so that our capacity will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more the Holy Spirit ministers His word to us, the richer we become.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every ministration of the Holy Spirit brings more riches to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through the continual ministration of the Holy Spirit through the word, our capacity is continually expanded.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are continually fed by the word, the Bible will be continually fresh to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the eyes of man, the Bible was completed eighteen or nineteen hundred years ago, and it bears no more significance to us than just a recapitulation of the thoughts and concepts presented at the time of its writing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In reality, however, the Spirit that was present at the time of the writing of the Scriptures is still with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we read the Bible today, we should read it as if it was written today.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever we read the Bible with our spirit, it is a new book to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although historically this book was completed over eighteen or nineteen hundred years ago, it is not old in any way, because it is a book written in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We become tired of many books after reading them a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we are not tired of the Bible even after reading it dozens of times.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is because it is a book in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we touch the Bible according to the letters or according to our thoughts, it will become old to us before very long.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we read it by the spirit, it is new to us every time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever we find a portion of the Word tasteless, it is not the portion itself that is tasteless but our spirit that has failed to function.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every portion of the Bible is full of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our spirit is strong enough, every passage will be precious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we do not read the Bible with our spirit, even a book as precious as Romans or a passage as wonderful as the sermon on the mount will be tasteless and meaningless to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually, it is not the Bible that has become meaningless, but our spirit which has become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once our spirit becomes fallen, the Bible becomes tasteless to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When our spirit is not strong, we lose the taste for reading.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when our spirit is strong, the Bible will be a fresh book, as one that has just been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The spirit of the Word is indeed rich.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A man should not presume that his spirit is strong and that he can meet all the demands.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only those who have passed through the dealings will know a little about the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The amount of dealing one experiences dictates the amount of his understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because we have only experienced limited dealing, we remain at the place where we were before, being ignorant of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is imperative that we pass through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more discipline we go through, the more we learn.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At a certain point, when our spirit somewhat matches the spirit of God's word, we will see light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Revelation will come, and we will be fed.</S>
