	 <h2 class="head5">Metal</h2>
<h2 class="head6">Gold</h2>
<p>Besides wood and stone, gold was also used in the building of the temple (1 Kings 6:20-21, 30, 32, 35; 7:48-51). In typology, gold signifies a great principle in the building of the church. Gold denotes that in the church there is not only man but also God. The building of the temple and its furniture&mdash;including the Ark, the table of the bread of the Presence, and the incense altar&mdash;were all composed of wood overlaid with gold. This typifies that the materials consist of humanity plus divinity. The church has a dual nature&mdash;humanity plus divinity. The materials are men who have passed through death and resurrection, who have been dealt with, and who also contain divinity. According to the outward appearance of the temple, the stone was visible and the wood was invisible. Once a person entered the Holy Place, he saw only an abundance of gold. This indicates that the church possesses the element of God.</p>
<p>Both wood and stone signify the human element, and gold signifies the divine element. The fact that stone and wood were associated with gold indicates that humanity has been mingled with divinity. The church is God added to man. In Revelation 1:20 there are seven churches. The seven lampstands are the seven churches. The number seven is composed of three plus four. Four is the number of the creature, and three is the number of the Triune God. Three plus four is seven. This means that the church is God added to man. When God is added to man who has passed through death and resurrection and who has been dealt with, two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity&mdash;are mingled together to become God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head6"> Silver and Bronze</h2>
<p>Silver and bronze, in addition to gold, were included among the materials used in building the temple (1 Kings 7:15-47; 1 Chron. 28:14-17; 29:5). Silver was not used much in the temple; however, bronze was used in great quantity. Just as in the tabernacle, bronze was used outside of the temple. The bronze altar and the bronze laver were in the outer court of the tabernacle, and bronze sockets were underneath the linen hangings of the wall of the outer court (Exo. 27:18-19; 38:17). Likewise, in the outer court of the temple there was a molten sea with twelve oxen upholding the sea, all of which were made of bronze (1 Kings 7:23-26). Bronze signifies the judgment that the Lord bore for us, that is, His work on the cross. Although not much silver was used in the temple, there was some silver, as in the tabernacle (v. 51). This indicates that the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth because the Lord Jesus was judged on the cross and accomplished redemption for us.</p>
<p>The materials for the building of the temple&mdash;bronze, silver, gold, timber, and stone&mdash;typify the materials used for the building of the church. Bronze typifies the judgment that the Lord bore on the cross. Silver typifies the redemption produced through the work of the cross. Gold typifies God Himself as divinity added into humanity. And timber and stone typify humanity that has passed through death and resurrection and has been dealt with. All these materials are the church of God on earth.</p>
