In 1971 these messages were published with some added material by the Gospel Book Room, Taipei, Taiwan.</p><p> </p><h2 class="head2">"Godhead" Defined</h2><p>In the following pages, the word <i>Godhead</i> (Gk. <span class="greek">&Theta;&epsilon;&oacute;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>), is used several times.

But we do not participate in His Godhead; we do not possess His Deity.</p></div><h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h1><p>There are two great mysteries in the Bible, one is the Triune God-the Father, Son, and Spirit, and the other is the Person of Christ. Christ is both God and man, and the two natures, divinity and humanity, are complete in Him. Although He has both divinity and humanity, He is still one Person. Our mind cannot thoroughly comprehend this. We can only accept this fact according to the revelation of the Scripture.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE AGES</h2><p>Before considering the revelation of the Bible concerning the Person of Christ, let us look at the views and teachings of different men throughout the ages concerning this matter. From the first century A.D. to the middle of the sixth century, the so-called bishops held different teachings concerning Christ&#8217;s Person. Hence, there were often disputations and eventually divisions in the church in the first six centuries. These different views and teachings can be summarized and classified into seven kinds. Among these, only one is proper and may be considered the orthodox teaching. The other six are improper; they are either wrong with respect to Christ&#8217;s humanity or mistaken regarding His divinity, and they either overly separate Christ&#8217;s divinity from His humanity or merge His divinity and humanity into one. We shall briefly discuss the seven different schools.</p><h2 class="head2">1. Christ Having Only Divinity but Not Humanity</h2><p>This is the erroneous teaching of the Docetists (A.D. 70-170). They said that Christ has divinity only and is without humanity. To the Docetists all matter is essentially evil. Since Christ is holy, He could never have the defilements of the human flesh. The body which He took on Himself while on earth was not a real body, but a mere illusion. His birth was not a real birth, and His death was not a real death.</p><p>Of course, this teaching is altogether absurd and clearly contrary to the revelation of the Scripture. The Bible definitely and explicitly says that the Lord is the Word of God who &#147;became flesh&#148; (John 1:14), who &#147;also Himself in like manner shared in the same [i.e., blood and flesh]&#148; (Heb. 2:14) and who became &#147;man&#148; (1 Tim. 2:5). Having a human body and human nature, He is a complete, true man.</p><p>Just as is mentioned in 1 John 4:2-3, this school denied that Christ is come in the flesh. The Gospel of John refutes them at its very beginning by declaring that Christ is the Word and that He is God who became flesh (John 1:1, 14).</p><h2 class="head2">2. Christ Having Only Humanity but Not Divinity</h2><p>This is the heresy of the Ebionites (A.D. 107). They maintained that Christ has human nature but is without the divine nature and that His life followed the common human pattern, though His behavior bore a special relationship to God.</p><p>This teaching is even more absurd than the preceding one. It closely resembles the false teachings of the modernists today and contradicts the Bible to the uttermost. The Bible definitely states that Christ is man, and it also clearly reveals that He is God (John 1:1; Heb. 1:8; Rom. 9:5). Christ is a complete, true man as well as the perfect, real God. He possesses complete and perfect humanity as well as complete and perfect divinity.</p><h2 class="head2">3. Christ&#8217;s Divinity Being Incomplete</h2><p>This is the erroneous teaching of the Arians. They said that Christ&#8217;s divinity is incomplete and that He came into being through the union of the Logos and the human body. Therefore, He cannot compare with God, but is merely all-excelling, being the most outstanding, the noblest, and the highest among the creatures-for the Word is not God who is uncreated; rather, He is the chief of all creation. Arius asserted that Christ was created by God, but was created before the ages, preceding all created things. Hence, there was a time when He did not exist. He further affirmed that because Christ died without sin, He could be resurrected, ascend to the heavens, and thus become God. The first general council assembled at Nicea in A.D. 325 declared Arianism a heresy and rejected it.</p><p>Under careful examination the false doctrine of the Arians is found to contain three points which are contrary to the revelation of the Scripture: (1) The Bible says clearly that &#147;the Word was God&#148; (John 1:1), yet Arius asserted that the Word is not the self-existent God and therefore maintained that Christ&#8217;s divinity is imperfect and cannot compare with God. This is truly a great heresy! (2) The Scripture says that Christ is the very God who exists from the beginning (John 1:1) and who is self-existent and without beginning. However, the Arians said that there was a time when Christ did not exist and that He became God only after His resurrection and ascension. This kind of teaching is also a great insult to Christ&#8217;s Person! (3) The Bible indeed says that Christ is the &#147;firstborn of all creation&#148; (Col. 1:15), and also that Christ is &#147;the beginning of the creation of God&#148; (Rev. 3:14), but it does not say that He was created before the ages, as was arbitrarily asserted by the Arians. In summary, they totally denied Christ&#8217;s uncreated divinity and were too dogmatic concerning the time of Christ&#8217;s becoming a created one. Justifiably, their teaching was pronounced a heresy and rejected by the general council at Nicea.</p><h2 class="head2">4. Christ&#8217;s Humanity Being Incomplete</h2><p>This is the absurd teaching of the Apollinarians. They said that Christ&#8217;s humanity is incomplete because He has the human body and human soul, but does not have the human spirit, which is mysteriously replaced by the Logos. The so-called Christ is thus formed with these three: Logos, soul, and body (unlike a normal human being which is made up of the spirit, soul, and body). The second general council which assembled at Constantinople in A.D. 381 pronounced this doctrine a heresy.</p><p>Of course, this doctrine greatly contradicts the revelation of the Bible. Although the Bible says that Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20), having complete divinity, it also says that He was born of Mary (Luke 2:5-7), having perfect humanity. He was born a child (Isa. 9:6) and grew up in a normal human way (Luke 2:40, 52). He not only possesses a human body (Heb. 2:14) and a human soul (Matt. 26:38), but also a human spirit (Mark 2:8). Hence, the Scripture clearly reveals to us that Christ is a man complete with spirit, soul, and body and that He possesses perfect humanity as well.</p><h2 class="head2">5. Christ&#8217;s Divinity and Humanity Being Separated</h2><p>This is the false doctrine of the Nestorians. They maintained that the two natures, divinity and humanity, in Christ are ever distinct and separate, for a person can never possess two natures. They reasoned that if there are two natures, there must be two persons. Therefore, they over-divided the two natures in Christ even to the extent of saying that there are two distinct beings-God and man-in the one body of Christ. The third general council which assembled at Ephesus in A.D. 431 rejected this doctrine as improper.</p><p>The teaching of the Nestorians is also evidently contrary to the biblical revelation. In the Old Testament the Bible shows us that the ark of testimony, which typifies Christ, is made of wood and overlaid with gold-it is a product of two natures. Gold typifies Christ&#8217;s divine nature, while wood typifies His human nature. Although gold and wood are of two distinct natures, they were united as one to become an ark. This indicates that although Christ possesses two natures, divinity and humanity, He is still one; and His two natures, though each being distinct, are not separate, but rather united into one. Although Christ has both divinity and humanity, the two natures have become one Person-it is not one body consisting of two persons, God and man.</p><h2 class="head2">6. Christ&#8217;s Divinity and Humanity Being Merged into One</h2><p>This is the wrong teaching of the Eutychians. They denied the distinctness and coexistence of Christ&#8217;s divinity and humanity, but asserted that the two natures were merged into one, which is neither divine nor human, but a third nature resulting through the merging of divinity and humanity-the divinity being dominant, with the humanity being absorbed by the divinity. Hence the Eutychians were also known as the Monophysites. Their teaching was rejected in the fourth general council at Chalcedon in A.D. 451.</p><p>Eutychianism also contradicts the Scripture. In the Old Testament, the Bible shows that the meal offering which typifies Christ consists of oil mingled with fine flour (Lev. 2:4; Exo. 29:40). Oil which typifies the Holy Spirit is related to Christ&#8217;s divine nature, while fine flour which typifies Christ&#8217;s behavior is related to His human nature. Although oil and fine flour are mingled into one, they are still two in nature-they are not merged into one to become a third nature. But Eutyches maintained that the two natures of Christ, divinity and humanity, were merged into one and became a third nature, just like an acid nature being mixed with an alkali nature becomes a neutral nature. The two natures of Christ, divinity and humanity, are mingled into one body like oil mingled with fine flour; when mixed they do not become one nature as transpires when an acidic and an alkaline substance are mixed.</p><h2 class="head2">7. Christ Having Both Divinity and Humanity-Each Being Complete Yet Both Being United in the Body of One Person</h2><p>This is the proper teaching of the orthodox school. After the aforementioned four general councils, the fifth general council was assembled in Constantinople in A.D. 553 where all those of the orthodox school acknowledged that Christ has both divinity and humanity, each being complete but united in the body of one person-without separation, without confusion, and without being changed into a new nature. Our Lord is definitely the Son of God and the Son of Man as well. He is the perfect God and a complete man as well. He is truly God and truly man, and He is both God and man. He has perfect divinity as well as complete humanity. The two natures in Him are neither confused nor separated. Although He has two natures, still He is one person. His Person cannot be divided, and His natures may not be confused. This is the proper revelation as shown in the entire Holy Word of God; this is also the orthodox view of the church of God through the ages. Our Lord who is both God and man, one person with two natures, without separation and without confusion is truly a mystery of mysteries and is worthy to receive our worship and praise forever!</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE SCRIPTURE</h2><p>Although the Person of Christ is a great mystery, the Bible speaks very clearly regarding this matter. This matter which is revealed in the Scripture is a mystery, but the words which the Bible uses in unveiling it are clear. Hence, though we cannot completely understand such a mystery, we can comprehend and receive the words which the Bible speaks concerning it.</p><h2 class="head2">1. Christ Is God</h2><p>Both in the Old and New Testaments, the Bible many times and in many ways clearly says that Christ is God.</p><h2 class="head3">A. In the Old Testament</h2><p>Hebrews 1:5 tells us that the word spoken by God in 2 Samuel 7:14, &#147;I will be his father, and he shall be my son,&#148; refers to Christ. God is His Father, and He is God&#8217;s Son. Such a designation, according to the biblical sense, shows equality with God (John 5:17-18). Beginning with Genesis, there are many places in the Old Testament which speak concerning Christ. However, it is not until here in 2 Samuel 7 that it says God is His Father. He is God&#8217;s Son, has the Godhead, and is equal with God. He came as the Son of God with the Godhead to be the Christ of God to accomplish God&#8217;s will.</p><p>Throughout the Psalms, Christ is repeatedly referred to as God. Psalm 2:7 says, &#147;The Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.&#148; This word refers to God raising the Lord Jesus from the dead (Acts 13:33) and declaring Him to be the Son of God who possesses the divine essence of the Godhead (Rom. 1:4). Although He became the Son of Man, and put on human nature and a human body, God raised Him up from the dead, declaring Him to be the Son of God, who has the divinity and the Godhead, being so much better than the angels (Heb. 1:4-5). In a Psalm praising Christ the Psalmist declares, &#147;Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre&#148; (Psa. 45:6). Hence, &#147;O God&#148; in this verse is directed to Christ. The Psalmist plainly addressed Him as God and praised Him as such. He is not only the fairest One among the children of men (v. 2), but also God who has the throne forever and the scepter. He who is the fairest Man is simply God, the very God who reigns on the throne in eternity.</p><p>In Psalm 102 the Psalmist declares, &#147;O my God...thy years are throughout all generations. Of old hadst thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end&#148; (Psa. 102:24-27). This is a word of praise to God, saying that God is both the Creator and Ruler of the heavens and earth, and that He is ever unchanging. According to Hebrews 1:8-12 this word speaks of Christ. Here again, the Bible clearly says that Christ is God, and praises Him as the Lord who creates and rules the heavens and earth, who is the same, and whose years shall have no end.</p><p>David declared, &#147;The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand&#148; (Psa. 110:1). In Matthew 22:42-45, the Lord pointed out that here David called Him Lord. This proves that He is God; otherwise, how could David call Him Lord since according to the flesh He is the Son of David? Although He became flesh and was made the Son of David, as God He is David&#8217;s Lord, the One who sits in heaven and is equal with God.</p><p>In the book of Isaiah it says, &#147;In that day there shall be a sprout of Jehovah for beauty and glory&#148; (Isa. 4:2, Darby). This sprout is Christ, who came forth from Jehovah God. Therefore, He, as the sprout that came out from God and possesses the Godhead, is for the manifestation of God&#8217;s beauty and glory. And we indeed see God&#8217;s beauty and glory manifested through Him. The prophet Isaiah declared, &#147;I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up [in the footnote Darby&#8217;s translation says that the Hebrew might mean, the Lord was high]...the whole earth is full of his glory&#148; (Isa. 6:1-3, Darby). John 12:38-41 says that here Isaiah saw the glory of the Lord Jesus. This shows us that the Lord Jesus is God who is high, who sits upon the throne in heaven, being praised by the seraphim, and whose glory fills the whole earth. Hallelujah! Our Lord is the most high God who sits on the throne and whose glory fills the universe! He is worthy not only to receive praises from the heavenly angels, but much more, to be praised and worshipped by us!</p><p>The Old Testament prophecy, &#147;a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel [that is, God is with us]&#148; (Isa. 7:14) was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus (Matt. 1:20-23). Although the Lord was a man conceived and born through a virgin, men called Him &#147;God is with us,&#148; for when He was in the flesh He was God with men. He is God who became a man and dwelt with men; hence, He is the very God who is with men. Isaiah 9:6 says, &#147;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given:...his name shall be called...Mighty God, Eternal Father [or Father of Eternity]...&#148; (Heb.). This word cannot be more clear and emphatic in saying that our Lord is not only the very God, but also the Father. He was born in the flesh as a child, yet He is the &#147;Mighty God&#148;; He came into time as a son; yet, He is the Father in eternity. Jesus who became flesh is God! The Son who came into time is the Father! He is our God, and He is also our Father.</p><p>Isaiah 11:10 says, &#147;And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people....&#148; Here &#147;the root of Jesse&#148; refers to Christ (cf. Revelation 22:16 which says He is the root of David). In verse 1 of this chapter it says that He is a shoot that came out of the stock of Jesse and a branch out of his roots (ASV). This indicates that He became a man and was a descendant of Jesse; He came forth from Jesse. But in this verse it says that He is the root of Jesse, indicating that He is God who is the root of Jesse, and Jesse came out of Him. Isaiah 40:3-11 says, &#147;The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.... And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed....Behold your God! Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand....He shall feed his flock like a shepherd....&#148; Based upon Matthew 3:3 which quotes the word &#147;the voice of him that crieth,&#148; we understand this passage here in Isaiah 40 refers to Christ. He is God&#8217;s expressed glory just as Hebrews 1:3 says, &#147;Who [Christ] being the effulgence of His glory.&#148; He is the God of God&#8217;s people, when He comes, it is the Lord coming to His people, as a Mighty One, and also as a Shepherd. Of course, these words will be fulfilled even more at His second coming. But when He came the first time, it was also the manifestation of God&#8217;s glory, the coming of the very God Himself, for He is God, the very Lord God Himself.</p><p>Jeremiah 23:5-6 says, &#147;I will raise unto David a righteous Branch [or, shoot or bud]...and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness&#148; (cf. 33:15, 16). This means that Christ on the one hand is a righteous shoot or bud that came out from David, that is, a descendant of David, and on the other hand He is The Lord who has become our righteousness. He is God as well as man.</p><p>Micah 5:2 says, &#147;But thou, Bethlehem...out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.&#148; Matthew 2:4-6 clearly points out that this passage speaks of Christ. Although He was born in Bethlehem and came out from there, His root or source is from of old, from eternity. Only God is from of old and from eternity. Hence, this proves that He is God, the very God who is from of old, from eternity.</p><p>Furthermore, the angel of the Lord, as mentioned in Exodus 3:2-12, Judges 6:11-24, 13:15-24, Zechariah 1:11-12, and 2:8-11, refers to Christ. These places clearly indicate that the angel of the Lord is The Lord God Himself. (Zechariah 12:8 which says, &#147;As God, as the angel of the Lord,&#148; proves this.) This shows us that Christ, who was sent of God as the angel of the Lord to accomplish God&#8217;s will, is the God who sent Him, the very Lord God.</p><p>In the above quoted passages, the Old Testament clearly reveals that Christ is God, having the Godhead, God&#8217;s status, God&#8217;s position, and divine power-He is nothing less than God Himself.</p><h2 class="head3">B. In the New Testament</h2><p>Matthew 1:20-23 says, &#147;For that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins. Now all this took place that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.&#148; In this passage there are three main points which strongly prove that our Lord is God Himself:</p><p>(1)He was born through the impregnation of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is God Himself. Hence, when He was born through the impregnation of the Holy Spirit, that was God incarnated. This exactly agrees with John 1:14 which says that He is God who became flesh.</p><p>(2)God ordained His name to be called Jesus. &#147;Jesus&#148; in Greek is equivalent to &#147;Joshua&#148; in Hebrew (Num. 13:16; Heb. 4:8), which means Jehovah Savior. This tells us that this Jesus is Jehovah God who became our Savior. Hence, He is God Himself.</p><p>(3)God not only ordained His name to be Jesus, but men also called Him by the name Emmanuel, which means God with us. This also indicates that He is God. He-the One who became flesh and dwelt among men-is God with men. In His God-ordained name &#147;Jesus,&#148; there is &#147;Jehovah,&#148; and in His name &#147;Emmanuel&#148; by which men called Him, there is &#147;God.&#148; He is Jehovah, and He is God. He is &#147;Jesus,&#148; Jehovah Savior, and He is also &#147;Emmanuel,&#148; &#147;God with us.&#148;</p><p>The New Testament shows us that on a number of occasions (particularly immediately before the Lord&#8217;s birth, at His baptism, and at His death), God clearly revealed either directly or through angels and men, that the Lord is the Son of God; that is, that the Lord has divinity and the Godhead, and is equal with God (John 5:17-18).</p><p>The word spoken by the angel Gabriel who was sent from God when Jesus was to be conceived was, &#147;He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest....The holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God&#148; (Luke 1:32, 35).</p><p>Then later God spoke from heaven after the baptism of Jesus and said, &#147;And behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight&#148; (Matt. 3:17). And when John the Baptist saw the Holy Spirit descend upon the Lord, he said, &#147;And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God&#148; (John 1:34). When the Lord first began calling people to follow Him, Nathanael said, &#147;Rabbi, you are the Son of God&#148; (John 1:49).</p><p>After the Lord walked upon the sea, caused Peter to do the same, and calmed the wind, the disciples said, &#147;Truly You are the Son of God&#148; (Matt. 14:33).</p><p>After Peter had received the revelation from God, he declared, &#147;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&#148; (Matt. 16:16).</p><p>At the time of the Lord&#8217;s transfiguration on the mountain, God spoke out of the cloud and said, &#147;This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight&#148; (Matt. 17:5).</p><p>The centurion and they that were with him at the Lord&#8217;s death said, &#147;Truly this was God&#8217;s Son!&#148; (Matt. 27:54).</p><p>When the Pharisees said that Christ is the Son of David (Matt. 22:42), the Lord said, &#147;How then does David in spirit call Him Lord?&#148; (Matt. 22:43), quoting the word (v. 44) from Psalm 110:1, proving that David in spirit had called Him Lord. Here He admits that He is the Lord of David. Although He became flesh and was made a son of David, He is actually the Lord of David because He is God.</p><p>Matthew 28:19 says, &#147;...baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&#148; In this word to His disciples the Lord placed Himself one with the Father and the Holy Spirit, thus proving that He has the same divinity and Godhead as the Father and the Holy Spirit.</p><p>A passage in the Gospel of Mark says, &#147;He said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their heart, Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?&#148; (Mark 2:5-7). This not only proves that the Lord Jesus is God who can forgive sins, but also indicates that the Lord confesses Himself to be God, the God who alone can forgive sins. Later in the same passage He also showed those who criticized Him that, just like God who searches men&#8217;s hearts, He knew the reasoning in their hearts and stood on the position of God to exercise God&#8217;s authority to forgive men&#8217;s sins (vv. 8-12).</p><p>Further in the Gospel of Mark it says, &#147;And when he was gone forth...one...asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?...And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God&#148; (Mark 10:17-18). The Lord Jesus&#8217; word here proves that He admits He is God who alone is good. By saying this, the Lord wants the one who confesses that He is good to confess also that He is God, the only good One.</p><p>The Gospel of John states, &#147;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God&#148; (John 1:1-2). According to verse 14, the Word here is the incarnated Lord Jesus. He not only was with God in the beginning, but He is the very God.</p><p>The Gospel of John further states, &#147;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#148; (John 1:18). This tells us that the Lord, being the only begotten Son of God, is the expression of God. No man has ever seen God, yet He declares God. The Father is the invisible God, the hidden God; the Lord Jesus is the manifest God.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said, &#147;That all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him&#148; (John 5:23). Here the Lord shows us that He enjoys the same honor with the Father because He is the Father, and He is also God.</p><p>Jesus said to the blind man whom He had healed, &#147;Do you believe in the Son of God? He answered and said, And who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him? Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One who is speaking with you. And he declared, Lord, I believe&#148; (John 9:35-38). Here the Lord Himself told the blind man whom He had healed that He is the Son of God. This is the Lord&#8217;s own word saying that He is the Son of God, has the Godhead, and is equal with God.</p><p>In such verses as John 10:30, 17:11 and 22, the Lord Jesus clearly says that He and the Father are one. Just as the Father is God, He also is God. In addition, John 13:3 says, &#147;Jesus, knowing...that He had come forth from God, and was going to God.&#148; This word proves that the Lord and God are one. He had &#147;come forth from God&#148; and &#147;was going to God,&#148; (not to where God is) because He is God.</p><p>Then, again, the Lord said to His disciples, &#147;If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also....He who has seen Me has seen the Father....I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me&#148; (John 14:7-10). If men have seen Him, they have seen the Father; if they have known Him, they have known the Father. He is in the Father, and the Father is in Him, because He and the Father are one; He is the Father, and He is also God.</p><p>The Lord Jesus also said, &#147;All that the Father has is Mine&#148; (John 16:15). This means that all that God is rests in the Lord, as Paul also testified in Colossians 2:9: &#147;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&#148; for He is God as well as the Father.</p><p>The Lord&#8217;s prayer to the Father on the last night of His stay on earth was, &#147;And now, glorify Me with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was&#148; (John 17:5). In this word He told us that He shared the glory with the Father even before the world was. This proves that He is the same as God in the beginning because He is the God who is in eternity.</p><p>The disciple, Thomas, said to the Lord after His resurrection, &#147;My Lord and my God!&#148; (John 20:28). And in the following verse, the Lord confirmed Thomas&#8217; word, for He actually is both Lord and God.</p><p>In stating, &#147;But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God&#148; (John 20:31), John declares that his entire Gospel was written in order to prove that the Lord is the Son of God-He is the same as God, having God&#8217;s nature and Godhead.</p><p>The book of Acts also says the Lord is Lord (2:36; 9:5; 10:36) as well as the Son of God (9:20; 13:33). This proves that the Lord has God&#8217;s divine nature and the Godhead and is the same as God.</p><p>There are numerous verses in the Epistles which state that the Lord is Lord as well as the Son of God, thus strengthening the evidence that He has God&#8217;s divine nature and the Godhead. In addition to these, the following few verses clearly and definitely show us that our Lord is God; He is no less than the unique God Himself. &#147;Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever&#148; (Rom. 9:5). This word cannot be more clear in saying that Christ is God blessed forever. &#147;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all&#148; (2 Cor. 13:14, ASV). Here the Lord is placed on the same level as God and the Holy Spirit. This proves that the Lord has the same divine nature and the Godhead as God and the Holy Spirit.</p><p>&#147;Who [Christ Jesus] subsisting in the form of God...&#148; (Phil. 2:6), and &#147;Who [the Son of His love] is the image of the invisible God...&#148; (Col. 1:15). The Lord not only has the form of God, but He is the image of God, for He is the very God. Colossians 2:2 and 9 tell us that the mystery of God is Christ and that in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. All that God is is Christ; all that is of the Godhead rests in Christ, for He is God Himself. &#147;And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness, who was manifested in the flesh...&#148; (1 Tim. 3:16). Christ in the flesh was God manifested in the flesh. It was actually the flesh, yet God was manifested in it! This is really a great mystery! Christ who became a man was God manifested in the flesh, and He is God Himself! &#147;Who [Christ] being the effulgence of His [God&#8217;s] glory and the express image of His substance&#148; (Heb 1:3). In the foregoing passage we have seen that Christ is God manifested, and here it says that He is the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory, the express image of His substance. He is God&#8217;s expression, His manifestation. &#147;But as to the Son...O God...&#148; (Heb. 1:8) is a quotation from Psalm 45:6 proving that the Son (Christ) is God. Following this, in verses 10 to 12, there is a quote from Psalm 102:25-27 proving that He is the God who is the same and whose years shall not fail. &#147;And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life&#148; (1 John 5:20). It says here that the Son of God is the true One. He is come that we may know Him who is true and that we may be in Him who is true. This true One is the true God, and He is eternal life. According to 1 John 1:2, &#147;eternal life&#148; refers to the Lord Himself. Hence, here it also tells us that the Lord is the true God.</p><p>There are also many verses in Revelation defining the Lord&#8217;s nature: &#147;From Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth&#148; (Rev. 1:4-5). Here the Lord is placed on the same level as God and the Holy Spirit, proving that He has the divine nature and the Godhead, just as do God and the Holy Spirit. &#147;I am the First and the Last...&#148; (Rev. 1:17). Revelation 2:8 and 22:13 also say the same thing. The First and the Last in the universe surely is the God who is from eternity to eternity (Psa. 90:2). Hence this word also proves that the Lord is the eternal God. In Revelation 2:18, the Lord refers to Himself as &#147;the Son of God.&#148; Here once again, the Lord Himself admits He has the divine nature and the Godhead. The terms &#147;the Root of David&#148; and &#147;the Offspring of David&#148; are used in Revelation 5:5 and 22:16 in reference to the Lord. Just as the offspring of David denotes that the Lord is man, and He came out of David; so the Root of David denotes He is God, and David came out of Him. &#147;To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever&#148; (Rev. 5:13). The Lamb here refers to the Lord. This verse states that He and God together receive equal praises from every creature in the universe. This proves He and God are one and He is equal with God in honor and glory. &#147;For its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb&#148; (Rev. 21:22). This verse shows us that the Lord and God are the temple (singular number), proving that the Lord and God are one. &#147;For the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb&#148; (Rev. 21:23). Just as the light is in the lamp and is one body with the lamp, so God is in Christ and is one body with Christ. God is the content of Christ, and Christ is the expression of God. Christ and God are one. In the phrase, &#147;the throne of God and of the Lamb&#148; (Rev. 22:1), the word throne is singular. God and the Lamb share one throne-this also places the Lord on an equal level with God. According to the preceding passage, God is the light, and the Lord is the lamp; therefore, God is in the Lord. It must be that God is in the Lord sitting on the throne. Otherwise how could two sit on the same throne together? In any case, these passages all prove that the Lord and God are one. In Revelation 22:13 the Lord Jesus says, &#147;I am the Alpha and the Omega.&#148; However, in Revelation 1:8, it is the Lord God who says, &#147;I am the Alpha and the Omega.&#148; This unmistakably proves that the Lord is God, &#147;He who is, and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty.&#148; Following that, He says that He is &#147;the First and the Last, the beginning and the end&#148; (Rev. 22:13). Our Lord is the God who is self-existing and ever-existing, without beginning and without end, yet who is the beginning and the end. May we offer up to Him the worship which He as God is worthy to receive! May we forever praise Him as God, the true God, the perfect and complete God! Amen! Hallelujah!</p><h2 class="head2">2. Christ Is Man</h2><p>The Bible, both in the Old and New Testaments, contains many passages which clearly reveal that Christ is man.</p><h2 class="head3">A. In the Old Testament</h2><p>The first prophecy in the Old Testament. concerning Christ says, &#147;And I will put enmity between thee [the serpent] and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel&#148; (Gen. 3:15). This verse prophesies that Christ, as the seed of the woman, will bruise the head of the old serpent, the devil. Later He actually was born of a woman (Gal. 4:4) and became the seed of woman; that is, He became a man, and through His death destroyed the devil (Heb. 2:14). This is the first place in the Scripture which speaks concerning Christ being a man. When God promised Abraham, &#147;And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed&#148; (Gen. 22:18), the promised seed He referred to was Christ (Gal. 3:16). Christ causes all the nations of the earth to be blessed. However, He needed to become the seed of Abraham, that is, to become a man so that the people on this earth could be blessed through Him. Hence, He actually became the seed of Abraham (Matt. 1:1) to become a man. Later in Genesis 26:4 and 28:14, God also gave Isaac and Jacob the same promise, saying that Christ would be their seed and that all the nations of the earth would be blessed in Him. These are prophecies concerning Christ becoming a man. Genesis 49:10 says, &#147;The sceptre shall not depart from Judah...until Shiloh come.&#148; &#147;Shiloh&#148; here, which means Peace-Giver, refers to Christ. This is a prophecy concerning Christ who was to become the seed of Judah, that is, to become a man-the Peace-Giver.</p><p>Moses prophesied to the Israelites, &#147;Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me&#148; (Deut. 18:15, ASV). This Prophet of whom he prophesied is Christ (Acts 3:22-23). His word here shows us that in order for Christ to be this Prophet He needed to be one of the brethren of the Israelites, that is, He needed to become a man.</p><p>&#147;The fruit of the land&#148; is referred to in Isaiah 4:2. According to the first half of this verse, this phrase refers to Christ. Isaiah 11:1 says, &#147;And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots&#148; (ASV). Based on the following verses 2 to 5, this word refers to Christ. He is a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a Branch out of his roots. This also means that the Lord needed to become a man. &#147;And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land&#148; (Isa. 32:2). Based on this passage in Isaiah we can see that &#147;a man&#148; is Christ. Christ who is our refuge is a man.</p><p>&#147;Behold my servant....A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench...&#148; (Isa. 42:1-4). Matthew 12:18-21 tells us that this speaks of the Lord Jesus. He, the servant of God, is a man. Taking the status of a man, He ministers to God as a servant.</p><p>&#147;Behold, my servant....His visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men&#148; (Isa. 52:13-14). According to the description here, in order to be God&#8217;s servant, the Lord needed to be a man. His visage was so marred, more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men-this shows He is a man.</p><p>The entire chapter of Isaiah 53 prophesies concerning Christ. &#147;For he shall grow before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.... He was cut off out of the land of the living....And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death....He was numbered with the transgressors&#148; (Isa. 53:2-3, 8-9, 12). These few verses fully depict the conditions and experiences of a man. Hence, Christ has to be a man, and He indeed became a man.</p><p>&#147;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch [or, Shoot or Bud]...and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness&#148; (Jer. 23:5-6). This word refers to Christ. He is David&#8217;s Shoot, that is, David&#8217;s descendant (Matt. 1:1; Rev. 22:16). He is &#147;The Lord Our Righteousness&#148;; He is also David&#8217;s Shoot. He is God; He is also man. Isaiah 4:2 says that He is &#147;the branch [or, shoot or sprout] of the Lord&#148;-He comes out of God and has God&#8217;s nature. Here it says He is the Shoot of David-He comes out of man and has a human nature.</p><p>The prophet Daniel declared, &#147;I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him&#148; (Dan. 7:13-14). In the visions Daniel saw Christ receiving the kingdom from God and coming back to earth to rule (cf. Luke 19:15: &#147;when he was returned, having received the kingdom&#148;). Christ in this vision appeared as a son of man. This means when He shall have received the kingdom and come back again to this earth to rule as a king, He is a man (Matt. 26:64). It is with the status of a man that He receives the kingdom from God and comes back to rule over the nations of the earth.</p><p>&#147;But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel&#148; (Micah 5:2). This prophecy says that Christ was to be born in Bethlehem (John 7:42) and become a man to rule for God. This also proves that Christ needs to be a man.</p><p>Additional Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ are: &#147;I will bring forth my servant the Branch [or, Shoot or Sprout]&#148; (Zech. 3:8); and &#147;Behold the man whose name is The Branch [or, Shoot or Sprout]; and he shall grow up [or, shoot] out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord: Even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne&#148; (Zech. 6:12-13). All these designations refer to Christ. He is God&#8217;s servant, He is a &#147;man,&#148; He is called the Shoot. He will build the temple of the Lord; He will sit on the throne and rule and be a priest. He can do all these things because He is a man. It is with the status of a man that He will come and do all these things. These are strong proofs that Christ needs to be a man, a real man, a complete man.</p><p>Furthermore, Zechariah 13:7 says, &#147;Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.&#148; In Matthew 26:31 the Lord points out that this word refers to Him. He is God&#8217;s shepherd; He is the man that is God&#8217;s fellow. Although He is God&#8217;s fellow, He is still a man. This also proves that the Lord needed to be a man.</p><h2 class="head3">B. In the New Testament</h2><p>The Old Testament shows us that Christ needed to be a man. In order to be a man He needed to become the seed of the woman as well as a seed of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Jesse, David, etc. At the beginning of the New Testament, Matthew chapter one shows us that Christ actually became the &#147;Son of Abraham&#148; and the &#147;Son of David&#148; (v. 1); He also became a descendant of Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and Jesse (vv. 2, 5-6), born of the virgin Mary (v. 16). He definitely became &#147;the seed of the woman,&#148; to be a real man, just like any ordinary man, having ancestors and genealogy.</p><p>Later, the second half of Matthew chapter one, Luke 1:30-31, and 2:5-12 tell us that Christ was conceived through the Holy Spirit and, following the normal human course, came out of His mother&#8217;s womb to be &#147;a child.&#148; Thus, the prophecy in Isaiah 9:6, &#147;For unto us a child is born,&#148; was fulfilled.</p><p>Luke 2:21-24 also shows us that this child who was born from His mother&#8217;s womb was circumcised on the eighth day according to the laws of the Israelites and was given the name Jesus. And when the days of His mother&#8217;s purification were fulfilled, He was brought to the temple and was presented to God. Everything was done according to the ordinary human way, proving He had definitely become a man.</p><p>Again later, Matthew chapter two shows us how Christ as &#147;a child&#148; was protected by His mother, taken away by Joseph to escape to Egypt (v. 14), brought back to the land of Israel (v. 21), and went to dwell in Nazareth and was thus called a Nazarene (v. 23).</p><p>Luke 2:40-52 also shows us that the boy Jesus &#147;grew, and waxed strong,&#148; went every year to Jerusalem after the custom of the Israelites, and &#147;increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.&#148; He had the proper living of a normal boy growing into manhood.</p><p>Matthew 13:55 says He is &#147;the carpenter&#8217;s son,&#148; and Mark 6:3 says He is &#147;the carpenter.&#148; This tells us that after He grew up He worked with Joseph as a carpenter. This fully proves that He is absolutely man.</p><p>In Matthew 4:3-4, after His baptism and before He started His ministry, the devil came to tempt Him, luring Him to manifest Himself as the Son of God. But the Lord replied, &#147;Man shall not live....&#148; This answer indicates that He acknowledged Himself to be a man and held firmly to the status and position of a man.</p><p>Later, on numerous occasions He called Himself &#147;the Son of Man,&#148; thus acknowledging Himself to be a man (Matt. 8:20; 9:6; 10:23; 11:19; 12:8, 32, 40; 13:41; 16:13, 27; 17:9, 22; 20:18, 28; 24:30, 37; 25:31; 26:24).</p><p>Even in the Gospel of John, a book which testifies that He is God, the Son of God, He not only often called Himself &#147;the Son of God,&#148; acknowledging that He has the divinity and the Godhead and is the same as God (5:17-23, 25-27; 8:36; 9:35-37; 10:33, 36; 14:13; 17:1), but He also called Himself &#147;the Son of Man,&#148; confessing that He is a man, has human nature, and is the same as man (1:51; 3:13; 5:27; 6:27; 8:28; 12:23; 13:31).</p><p>Finally, in Matthew 26:63-64 before His crucifixion the high priest who was judging Him asked Him if He was the Son of God. On one hand, the Lord answered, &#147;You said it!&#148; Yet, on the other hand, He still called Himself &#147;the Son of Man,&#148; holding firmly to His human status.</p><p>Besides this, His birth, His living and actions on earth all prove that He is a man: Philip saw Him as &#147;the son of Joseph, from Nazareth,&#148; a real man (John 1:45). And coming into His own country, His own people called Him &#147;this man.&#148; They knew that He was &#147;the carpenter&#8217;s son,&#148; and that He had a &#147;mother,&#148; &#147;brothers,&#148; and &#147;sisters&#148; (Matt. 13:54-56). These facts strongly prove that He is absolutely a man, not a bit different from an ordinary man. He reclined at the table and ate with men just like an ordinary man (Matt. 9:10-11; Luke 7:36; John 12:2). When He was crucified, the soldiers divided His garments (John 19:23-24), thus proving that He put on clothing just like a normal human being. He, &#147;being wearied from the journey&#148; and being thirsty, asked a woman for a drink (John 4:6-7). He &#147;wept&#148; as did those who were present at that time (John 11:33, 35). He &#147;laid aside His garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself...poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded&#148; (John 13:4-5). All these actions prove that He is absolutely a man.</p><p>The Lord was a man, not only while He was on earth before His death, but even after His resurrection, His ascension to heaven, and His coming again in the future, He still is and forever will be a man in eternity. After His resurrection He appeared to His disciples and said to them, &#147;Behold my hands and my feet....Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me have. And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet....And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of a honeycomb. And he took it, and did eat before them&#148; (Luke 24:39-43). This proves that after His resurrection He is still a man, has flesh and bones, and eats like a man. He told the high priest, &#147;Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power&#148; (Matt. 26:64). This means after ascending to heaven, He is still a man. He told His disciples, &#147;For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels&#148; (Matt. 16:27). Again, in Matthew 26:64 He says, &#147;You shall see the Son of Man...coming on the clouds of heaven.&#148; This means when He comes again in the future He is still a man. He said to Nathanael, &#147;You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man&#148; (John 1:51). This describes His condition in the future, in eternity. He still is the Son of Man; He still is man unto eternity.</p><p>In addition to the four Gospels, other New Testament books contain verses which also prove He is a man: He is &#147;Jesus of Nazareth, a man&#148; (Acts 2:22). Stephen saw Him in heaven as &#147;the Son of Man standing on the right hand of God&#148; (Acts 7:55-56). Romans 1:3, &#147;Jesus Christ our Lord, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,&#148; clearly proves that He is a man of blood and flesh. He is &#147;the one Man Jesus Christ&#148; (Rom. 5:15). He is &#147;the last Adam,&#148; and He is &#147;the second man&#148; (1 Cor. 15:45, 47). He is the One who died for all (2 Cor. 5:14). He is the seed of Abraham (Gal. 3:16). &#147;Out of whom according to flesh is the Christ&#148; (Rom. 9:5) proves He is a man with flesh who came out of Israel. That He was &#147;come of a woman&#148; (Gal. 4:4) certainly proves that He is a man. He &#147;became in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man&#148; (Phil. 2:7-8). This absolutely proves that He became a man. First Timothy 2:5 refers to &#147;the Man, Christ Jesus.&#148; He was made a man who is a little inferior to the angels (Heb. 2:6-9). &#147;Since therefore the children have partaken of blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner shared in the same&#148; (Heb. 2:14). This means He became a man of blood and flesh. The statement, &#147;Jesus Christ is come in the flesh&#148; (1 John 4:2), clearly shows us He became a man. He is &#147;One like the Son of Man&#148; (Rev. 1:13). He is &#147;the Lion of the tribe of Judah&#148; (Rev. 5:5). This means He is a descendant of Judah. This also proves that He is a man. He is &#147;the Offspring of David&#148; (Rev. 22:16) surely proves that He is a man.</p><h2 class="head2">3. Christ Is Both God and Man</h2><p>In all the verses mentioned above whether in the Old or New Testaments, we can clearly see that on the one hand Christ is God and on the other hand He is man. On the one hand He is man, and on the other hand He is God-He is a mysterious One, God as well as man, man as well as God.</p><h2 class="head3">A. In the Old Testament</h2><p>On the one hand Christ is &#147;a child&#148; and on the other hand He is the &#147;Mighty God&#148; (Isa. 9:6). He is both.</p><p>Christ is the Shoot of David, the descendant of David; yet, He is also &#147;The Lord Our Righteousness,&#148; God becoming our righteousness (Jer. 23:5-6). He is a descendant of man-He is a man, and He is the very God Himself-He is both.</p><p>Christ is a man who came out of Bethlehem, but He is also God who is from of old, from eternity (Micah 5:2). On the one hand He is a man in time, and on the other hand He is God in eternity. He is both.</p><h2 class="head3">B. In the New Testament</h2><p>Christ is both the Son of David-a man, and the Lord of David-God Himself (Matt. 22:42-45). Christ is the Son of Man &#147;who came out of the seed of David&#148; having humanity; and He was designated to be the &#147;Son of God&#148; in power, having divinity-God&#8217;s nature (Rom. 1:3-4). Christ is a man of flesh who came out of Israel, yet He &#147;is over all, God blessed forever&#148; (Rom. 9:5).</p><p>He is the One &#147;subsisting in the form of God,&#148; but who became &#147;in the likeness of men,&#148; and was &#147;found in fashion as a man&#148; (Phil. 2:6-8). For He is God who became a man. Hence, He is God, and He is also man; He is man, and He is also God.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said with His own mouth, &#147;I am the Root and the Offspring of David&#148; (Rev. 22:16). &#147;The Root of David&#148; refers to God out from whom came David; &#147;the Offspring of David&#148; refers to a seed, a man, who came out of David. Therefore, this is to say that Christ Himself acknowledges that He is man as well as God. He is both.</p><p>Thus, the Bible clearly reveals to us that our Lord is God as well as man, the true God and the true man, the perfect God and the perfect man. He is nothing less than God and nothing less than man, having complete divinity and complete humanity. He is God with the divine nature; He is also man with a human nature. The Gospel of John continually shows us these two aspects of Him. He is God who knows everything and sees everything (John 1:47-48), who is omnipresent, and who descended out of heaven yet is still in heaven (John 3:13). He is a man who can get weary and thirsty (John 4:6-7). He can also weep (John 11:35). Both God and man are complete in Him. This is really mysterious. It is no wonder that His name is called &#147;Wonderful!&#148; (Isa. 9:6).</p><h2 class="head2">4. Christ Is the Creator</h2><p>God is the Creator of all things (Gen. 1:1; 2:1-3). Since Christ is God, He surely is also the Creator of all things. This is clearly revealed in the Scripture: &#147;O my God....Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands&#148; (Psa. 102:24-25, ASV). We have seen that this word refers to Christ. Christ is God who created heaven and earth. &#147;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being&#148; (John 1:3). &#147;Through whom are all things, and we through Him&#148; (1 Cor. 8:6). &#147;Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him&#148; (Col. 1:16). &#147;Through whom [the Son] also He [God] made the universe&#148; (Heb. 1:2).</p><p>These verses explicitly tell us that Christ is the Creator of all things; all things have been created and came into being through Him.</p><h2 class="head2">5. Christ Is a Creature</h2><p>Man is a creature (Gen. 1:27; Acts 17:26). Since Christ is man, surely He is also a creature. This is revealed in the following two verses.</p><p>Colossians 1:15 says the Son is &#147;Firstborn of all creation.&#148; This tells us in plain words that Christ is created. He is the Firstborn of the creation, the First of all creatures.</p><p>In Revelation 3:14 Christ calls Himself &#147;the beginning of the creation of God.&#148; This also tells us He is created, the chief of the creation, the first One of all creatures.</p><p>In some translations, the above two passages do not match the meaning in the original Greek text (the Chinese Version is an example of this). Some do not understand these two passages properly; hence, they deny that Christ is created. However numerous authoritative versions such as the King James Version, American Standard Version, Revised Standard Version, New American Standard Bible, Amplified New Testament, Interlinear Greek-English New Testament, Conybeare&#8217;s Translation, Wuest&#8217;s, Darby&#8217;s New Translation, Concordant Version, and the Berkeley Version translate Colossians 1:15 either: &#147;the firstborn of every creature,&#148; or &#147;the firstborn of all creation.&#148; According to the original text, this translation is correct. Based on the proper translation, &#147;the firstborn of all creation,&#148; in 1934 Brother Watchman Nee delivered the following word: &#147;In creation the Son is the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15),  and the beginning of the creation of God (Rev. 3:14). According to His eternal plan and before the foundation of the world, God ordained that the Son become flesh and accomplish redemption (1 Pet. 1:20). In God&#8217;s plan the Son was the first in creation&#148; (The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, Vol. 11, p. 734).</p><p>&#147;Firstborn&#148; in Greek is prototokos. Proto means the first one or the beginning; tokos means born, produced. Hence, prototokos means the first one born, the one produced in the beginning; it can thus be translated &#147;the firstborn.&#148; The New Testament uses this word six times in referring to Christ. It says: He was the &#147;firstborn son&#148; of Mary (Luke 2:7); He is the &#147;firstborn among many brothers&#148; (Rom. 8:29); He is the &#147;firstborn of all creation&#148; (Col. 1:15); He is the &#147;firstborn from among the dead&#148; (Col. 1:18); He is the &#147;Firstborn&#148; of God (Heb. 1:6); and He is the &#147;Firstborn of the dead&#148; (Rev. 1:5). Although the above six references use different terms, all the terms refer to Christ being the Firstborn One. That Christ is &#147;the firstborn of all creation&#148; means He is the first One, the chief of all creation. This absolutely does not mean that He is before all creation and is therefore not included in all creation.</p><p>Colossians 1:15-18 says twice that the Lord is the Firstborn. In verse 15 it says the Lord is the &#147;firstborn of all creation&#148;; in verse 18 it says He is the &#147;firstborn from among the dead.&#148; &#147;The firstborn from the dead&#148; means the Lord is the first One among the resurrected. &#147;The firstborn of all creation&#148; means He is the first One among the created. This means that all in all, whether among the created ones or resurrected ones, the Lord is the Firstborn, the Beginning, and occupies the first place.</p><p>There are two great categories of things in the universe: the created and the resurrected. In this passage, from the second half of verse 15 through verse 17, it speaks of the first category, including all creation, among whom the Lord is the Firstborn, the first One. Verse 18 is concerned with the second category, including the church, among whom also the Lord is the Firstborn, the first One. In both categories the Lord is the Firstborn, the first One. This passage proves that in all things He is the Firstborn, and He has the preeminence. Whether among the created or the resurrected, He is the Firstborn, He is the Head; therefore, He is above all and has the preeminence in all things. The central thought of this passage is that Christ has the preeminence in all things. Unless He is the Firstborn of all creation and the first One of all creation, how could He have the preeminence among all creation?</p><p>Christ is a creature because He became &#147;flesh&#148; (John 1:14), took part of &#147;blood and flesh&#148; (Heb. 2:14), was born a &#147;child&#148; (Isa. 9:6), and became a &#147;Man&#148; (1 Tim. 2:5). &#147;Flesh,&#148; &#147;blood and flesh,&#148; &#147;child,&#148; and &#147;man&#148;-these surely indicate creatures. Are not &#147;flesh&#148; and &#147;blood and flesh&#148; created things? Are not &#147;child&#148; and &#147;man&#148; created things? Of course they are! Then, since Christ became these things, how can we say that He is not a creature? If we acknowledge that Christ is man, then we must admit that He is a creature; if we deny that He is a creature, then we deny that He is a man.</p><p>We saw earlier that Christ is a man in the flesh not only before His death, but even after His resurrection He is still a man with bones and flesh-He still has a created body; however, it is a resurrected body. Furthermore, He still wears the created human nature in heaven today, just as the last line of stanza 5 in Hymn #113 says: &#147;He wears our nature on the throne&#148; (Hymns, Living Stream Ministry). Even in the future when He shall come again and in eternity, forever He is man and always wears human nature. Since He became flesh and put on human nature, He will never put it off. From His incarnation to eternity He is always man, always wears the created human nature, and always is a created one.</p><p>Christ is the &#147;only begotten Son of God (John 1:18; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9); He is uniquely one, has divinity and Godhead, and is without beginning, existing in Himself just like God. But Christ as the &#147;firstborn of all creation&#148; or &#147;Firstborn&#148; in resurrection does not come into being by Himself; rather, He has a beginning in creation and resurrection. As to His being the Firstborn of all creation, He has the created human nature. As to His being the Firstborn of the resurrected, He has the uncreated, divine nature and the created, resurrected human nature as well. He, the Firstborn of the resurrected, becomes the firstborn Son of God. As to His uncreated divine nature, He is God&#8217;s only begotten Son and is the same as God, without beginning and self-existing. However, according to His uncreated, divine nature, plus His created, resurrected human nature, He is God&#8217;s firstborn Son, the Firstborn of the resurrected, but not without beginning and not self-existing, but rather, beginning from resurrection. Regarding His created human nature, He is the Firstborn of all creation, so He surely is not without beginning nor is He self-existing; rather, He begins from creation. He is the uncreated, self-existing One; He is also the Firstborn of the created ones and the resurrected ones. He is called &#147;the Firstborn of all creation&#148; because even before creation God foreordained that He (Christ) should become a created man, just as we have quoted earlier from Watchman Nee&#8217;s word: &#147;For in His eternal plan, before the foundation of the world, God has preordained that the Son should become flesh to accomplish redemption (1 Pet. 1:20). In God&#8217;s plan, therefore, the Son is the first One among the creatures.&#148; This is not in accordance with Arius&#8217;s assertion that Christ was created before the foundation of the world. Such assertion is without scriptural basis. The Bible shows us that before the foundation of the world, even before anything was created, God had foreordained that Christ become a created man in order to accomplish His purpose. Hence, in God&#8217;s plan and in His eternal view, Christ is the first one created-He is the Firstborn of all creation, the Head of all the created ones. Therefore, to say that Christ is created and that He is the &#147;firstborn of all creation&#148; is altogether in agreement with the scriptural revelation and is altogether founded on scriptural ground.</p><h2 class="head2">6. Christ Is Both the Creator and a Creature</h2><p>According to the complete revelation of the Bible, Christ is both the Creator and the creature, because He is God and He is man-He is God who creates, He is also man who is created. As to His being God, He is the uncreated Creator, the I AM who is without beginning. But as to His being man, He is created, the Firstborn, with a beginning. We must see and know these two aspects of Him. We must see that He is God, and He is also man; He is the Creator, and He is also a creature; He is the I AM; He is also the Firstborn; He is without beginning, and He is also with a beginning. Otherwise our understanding of Him is inaccurate, unorthodox, and contrary to scriptural revelation and will invariably fall into error and incompleteness.</p><p>Our knowledge of the Lord should not be limited by our own view; rather, we should accept the whole revelation of the Bible. However much the Bible reveals is that which we must receive. Some think that since the Lord is God, how could He become man. Likewise, some think that since the Lord is the Creator, how could He become a creature. Although they believe the Lord is God and man as well, they only believe Him to be the Creator, not a creature. But the Bible clearly reveals that the Lord is the Creator and that He became a creature, just as on one hand, He is God, and on the other hand, He became man. We must know and accept the various aspects of what the Lord is and not ignore or deny any aspect of what He is.</p><p>We should never try to use our limited, logical mind to analyze our unlimited Lord! The Pharisees recognized that Christ was the Son of David, based on one aspect of the Bible; however, they did not know that the Bible also reveals another aspect of the Lord which says that Christ is also David&#8217;s Lord. We should be warned not to repeat their mistake by limiting ourselves to one aspect of the biblical revelation of Christ and neglecting or rejecting the other aspect. The Scripture on one hand, says that Christ is the Creator; on the other hand, it also says that He is a creature. This is the complete, clear revelation of the Bible; we should not deviate from it nor come short of it. Our all-inclusive Lord is too wonderful! He is so wonderful it is hard for us to comprehend Him. He is really worthy to be called &#147;Wonderful!&#148; He is really worthy also to be appreciated and loved by us!</p><p>If we confess only that our Lord is the Creator yet deny that He is a creature, in principle this is the same as those who deny that the Lord came in the flesh (1 John 4:2-3). Hence, we should never deny the created aspect of our Lord simply because of our narrow, limited view. He is the uncreated God; He is also a created man! He is the Lord of creation, and He is also a creature, even the &#147;firstborn of all creation.&#148;</p><h2 class="head2">7. Christ Is Still the Creator though He Has Become a Creature</h2><p>When Christ became a creature, He did not lose His eternal, uncreated nature-He remains the Creator. In like manner, when He became man, He did not lose His divine nature-He is still God. Although He became a created man, He remains the uncreated God. Although He became a creature, He still is the Creator. Now He is the all-inclusive Christ who has both divinity and humanity and who has the uncreated divine life as well as the created human life. He is the uncreated I AM; He is also the created Firstborn. May we love and worship Him forever and ever! Amen!</p></body></html>
