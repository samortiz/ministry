<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(28)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 31, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER H. B.</h2><p>When I was young I suffered from pneumonia in both my lungs. I was seriously ill. My family even prepared for my funeral. I looked to the Lord and at the same time took medicine for my healing. When the war in Europe broke out, my family lost several million U.S. dollars within a few days. My father had a stroke because of this great loss and died from it. I began to fellowship with the Brethren, but I was still not clear about my salvation. I met Brother Nee for the first time in Shanghai. Later I went to Peking and began to meet there. I once argued with the brothers concerning some points of truth. The responsible brothers even hit me with a chair and kicked me. I also attended some meetings of the Bethany Congregation, and my name was among them. Later I left that denomination and asked to have my name removed. For a while I cherished some hope for the denominations, but I have since lost this hope. Today I no longer act like I did before. My eyes today are on the Lord Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Taking the Straight Pathway</h2><p>You should take a less detoured course in the work and should no longer busy yourself with the minor and inconsequential jobs. A worker must maintain his special characteristics before the Lord. At the same time, he should not be without coordination; he should work in coordination with others. God's way of leading can produce two results. In the first case, the potter works on the vessel, and the vessel breaks as the wheel turns. Cracks appear, and the potter does not mend it. In the second case, the same thing happens, but the potter decides to mend the crack. Man's intention is to take the second way, the mending way. If something is spoiled, mend it. But Jeremiah 18 tells us that the worker does not mend; rather, he discards what he has broken and makes a fresh vessel out of new clay. This is a parable; it speaks of God's way in leading men. Once a man takes a wrong step, he cannot turn back. God will not use those who have taken a wrong turn. He does not mend. The only thing left to do is to ask God for mercy to make another vessel. Some have made the wrong turn in their profession or their marriage. God will not recover them. Brother, you have to forget about the past. Let the past go and close the book. You have to ask the Lord to make a new vessel. Do not ask God to mend the broken pieces. Rather, present a new lump to His hand, from which He can make a vessel fit for His use. God does not turn back to remake old vessels. It is a serious thing to take the wrong turn. Some mistakes can never be remedied. God may have to raise up another vessel for His glory. If one slips and stumbles on the right way, he can be recovered; all he has to do is stand up again. But if his pathway is wrong, it is not easy to recover him. It is impossible to try to be a mended vessel. If we have taken a crooked pathway once, we have to accept our mistake. We should not hold on to the past. Instead, we should ask God to make a new vessel.</p><p>We have to be pliable, and we have to know that our past ways were wrong. The vessel is broken, and we need to have a new one made. Do not hold on to the past. We must consider the past as gone. We should not try to mend the broken vessel, but we should have a new beginning, a new vessel. When a vessel becomes broken, God does not remake it. Instead, He makes a new one. Therefore, you have to humble yourself before God and pray that He will turn all curses into blessings. God may make you a more glorious vessel than you were before. But whatever God does, you will not be the same vessel. In the church some do not want to become God's ordained vessels, while others do. Those who do, bring glory to God. If the brothers all know the church, the way of the work will have less detours.</p><p>The churches everywhere may have problems, and their conditions are different. The churches have their local situations, and there is no way we can unify their conditions. This problem also existed at the time of Paul. The more sectarian a group is, the more uniform its members are. But the more a local church is according to God's standard, the less uniform it will be. If the churches are churches at all, they are different from locality to locality. There was the church in Corinth, and there is also a church in Ephesus. Paul said, "All who are in Asia turned away from me" (2 Tim. 1:15). Paul was a great servant of the Lord, yet even he could not unify all the churches.</p>
