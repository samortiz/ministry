   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Four Ages Dispensations in the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why is it that in theology the term dispensation is understood as "age"?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is because the dispensation of every period is actually the period itself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the record of the Bible, the dispensation of God's economy can be divided into four great periods.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first period is the dispensation of the patriarchs, the second period is the dispensation of law, the third period is the dispensation of grace, and the fourth period is the dispensation of righteousness executed in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, God's dispensation in the first period is concerning the patriarchs, and it can be called the dispensation of the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This age, which was from Adam to Moses, lasted approximately two thousand five hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's dispensation in the second period is concerning His dealing with men by the law, and it can be called the dispensation of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This age, which was from the decree of the law by Moses to Christ's incarnation, lasted for about one thousand five hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's dispensation in the third period is concerning the application of the grace of Christ, and it can be called the dispensation of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This age, which is from the Lord Jesus' first coming to His second coming, should last for about two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's dispensation in the fourth period is concerning God's execution of everything according to His righteousness, and it can be called the dispensation of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This will be the millennial kingdom, which will be from the Lord Jesus' second coming to the judgment at the great white throne, and will last for one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the old creation God has these four dispensations: the arrangement for the patriarchs, the administration by law, the supply by grace, and finally the execution according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The patriarchs, the law, grace, and righteousness are God's four dispensations arrangements .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Consequently, these four dispensations arrangements spontaneously form four ages: the age of the patriarchs, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First was the age of the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the age of the patriarchs was the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After the age of law is the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the age of grace will be the age of righteousness, the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These ages will last for a total of approximately seven thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible Revealing the Years of Creation</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is difficult to calculate the number of years since the creation of the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because before the creation of Adam there was another world, the preadamic world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the study of geologists, no one knows how many millions of years that world lasted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In fact, it is very hard to have an accurate calculation since the calculations by astronomers also vary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, it is hard to say how many years the world before the creation of Adam lasted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the record of the entire book of Genesis, only verse 1 of chapter one refers to the preadamic world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one knows how long ago this "beginning" was.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 2a goes on to say, "But the earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that the world at that time was in chaos and had been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No one knows how much time elapsed after the earth had been covered with darkness under deep water before God came in to do the work of re-creation, not creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 2b says, "And the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At this time the Spirit of God was moving and brooding upon the surface of the waters to begin His work of re-creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God firstly divided the light from the darkness, then He separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>3-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was still not creation but only restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After this, God gathered together the waters under the heavens into one place to form the sea, and He let the dry land appear from underneath the water vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This also was not creation but only a restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the dry land had appeared, God caused the earth to grow plants.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This, however, was not restoration but creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, God created the plants vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then God began to restore the heavens and caused the sun, the moon, and the stars to appear vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>14-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is hard to say whether this was creation or restoration because verse 16 says, "And God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, God created the fish, that is, the living creatures in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the same time, He also created the birds, that is, the living creatures in the air vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, He created the living creatures on the dry land, which consisted mainly of three categories cattle, beasts, and creeping things vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way living creatures were generated in the seas, on the land, and in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These records show that the re-creation which began from Genesis 1:2 includes both restoration and creation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The most prominent thing in God's re-creation is that He created man on the sixth day.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Concerning the creation of man, the Bible uses three different terms created, made, and formed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 26 says, "And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here the word make is the same word used in the past tense in verses 7 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 27 says, "And God created man in His own image."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The word created here is also used in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 7 of chapter two says, "Jehovah God formed man with the dust of the ground."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The word used here is formed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Hebrew word for created is bara.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To create means to produce something out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Hebrew word for made is asah.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To make means to work upon an existing substance in order to produce something out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Hebrew word for formed is yatsar.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To form means to give shape to something in the same way that a potter molds clay into a form.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Man was not only created but also made and formed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is because God used the dust of the ground 2:7; 3:19 , which already existed there, as material to make man a physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, God used an existing substance to make the final product man's physical body, and He also formed man in the same way that a potter molds a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God used the dust to form man's shape and then breathed into him the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This breath of life, which came out from God, became the spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thus, man was enlivened and became a living soul with a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, man was made and formed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, the spirit of man was created by God because it came from the breath of life which came out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, God's original creation 1:1 , particularly the creation of the heavens and the earth, was in the age long before Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have no way to count the number of years of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, if we count from Adam until the millennial kingdom, it should be a little over, if not exactly, seven thousand years.</S>
