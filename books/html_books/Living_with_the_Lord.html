<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is a translation of messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee in a conference held in the church in Taipei on August 26-31, 1975. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE BEING<br />
THAT WE WOULD LIVE WITH HIM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:4, 12-14, 29; 14:16-20, 23; 15:4-5; 17:21, 23; 6:57</h1>
<p>We thank the Lord for allowing us to gather once again in His name where we can worship Him and release our spirit. We can release our spirit vocally or silently. Either way allows us to release our spirit as long as we use our spirit and do not remain in our mind. I believe that in this series of messages the Lord will grace us and bring us on another step.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING A GLORIOUS PLAN<br />
AND ACCOMPLISHING FIVE GREAT ACTS</h2>
<p>Our God has a purpose and a work. The Bible reveals that based upon His purpose God formed a plan in eternity past. This plan was made according to God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. God had a desire, a delight, in His heart, and according to this desire, delight, He made a glorious plan in eternity past. This plan may appear to be rather simple, but intrinsically it is truly mysterious. In His plan God desires to gain a group of people as a corporate vessel to contain Him that He might be expressed through them.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is to express Himself. God is a hidden, mysterious God. Although one may search the heavens, the earth, and the entire universe, it is not easy to find God. It seems that there are many things in the universe but that there is no God. However, we know that above all things and in the midst of all things God does exist. God is real, actual, and living, yet He is hidden and concealed. God is hidden, but the Bible shows us that He wants to be expressed. In Himself He is hidden, but when He enters into us, He can be expressed through us. Although God is a hidden God, we can express Him. In fact, His expression depends upon us. This is God&rsquo;s eternal heart&rsquo;s desire. This is what He has ordained according to His eternal plan.</p>
<p>Since God has a plan, God also works. The Bible begins with an account of God&rsquo;s first work&mdash;creation&mdash;and ends with a city that is called &ldquo;the holy city, New Jerusalem&rdquo; (Rev. 21:2). This city is not the result of God&rsquo;s work of creation but of His work of building. God begins with creation and ends with building. Creation is His first step. Building is His final step. God&rsquo;s creation is for God&rsquo;s building. The two&mdash;God&rsquo;s creation plus God&rsquo;s building&mdash;accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal plan and fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>Between the two ends of the Bible, that is, between God&rsquo;s creation and God&rsquo;s building, God takes five major steps and accomplishes five major acts&mdash;redemption, regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification. We must inscribe these five great acts in our hearts. We were fallen, so God came to redeem us out of the fall. After redemption God in the Son came into us to be our life. Now in addition to our natural life, we have a spiritual life, the divine life. This life regenerates us, causing us to be born again. Once we have been regenerated, this life within us begins to transform us through a metabolic process, changing our nature into His nature. Then in addition to transformation, God takes a further step to conform us into His image. Every believer will eventually have God&rsquo;s image and be like Him. Finally God will bring us into glory, making us the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s building. This is an overview of the whole Bible. The Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s creation at the beginning and of God&rsquo;s building at the end. Between these two ends the Bible reveals God&rsquo;s work to redeem us, regenerate us, transform us, conform us, and lead us into glory. None of these great acts is according to our religious or natural concept.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD TAKING TWO STEPS TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PLAN</h2>
<p>Now we will consider how God accomplishes His plan. By using simple words we hope to present a picture of how God does this. To accomplish His plan, God has taken two steps. The first step that He took was to become flesh. If He had not become flesh, God would have no way to accomplish redemption. Thus, in order to redeem us God came from heaven to earth, brought divinity into humanity, and became flesh. The One who became flesh, God Himself, is Jesus Christ our Lord. We should never try to find God outside of Jesus Christ, for outside of Jesus Christ there is no true God. Jesus Christ is God Himself, the Lord of all creation, and Jehovah. Do you believe in God? If you believe in God, you must believe in Jesus Christ. The Jews believe in God but reject Jesus Christ. Consequently, they do not have God because Jesus Christ is God, and God is in Jesus Christ. God became flesh&mdash;an actual historical figure who was born in a manger more than one thousand nine hundred seventy years ago. As a man He lived on the earth for more than thirty years, and at the end of His life He was nailed to the cross, shedding His precious blood to accomplish redemption, solving the problem of our sin and of every negative thing. This was God&rsquo;s first step to accomplish His eternal plan&mdash;He become flesh in order to redeem us.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s first step was to become flesh; His second step was to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In redeeming us God entered into death and passed through death. He took a journey through death, but death had no effect on Him and could not do anything to Him. Death did not take Him captive; rather, He willingly walked into death, gave Himself to death, and allowed death to do to Him all that it could. In the end, death had no power, so He passed through death and came out of death. This was His resurrection. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. His first step was to become flesh; His second step was to become the life-giving Spirit. He became flesh for our redemption; He became the life-giving Spirit to enter into us and to be our life. Today this life-giving Spirit is omnipresent&mdash;in the heavens and on earth, above us and below us, and inside of us and outside of us. God became flesh to accomplish redemption, and He became the Spirit to be our life.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING ONLY THAT<br />
WE STOP OURSELVES TO LIVE WITH HIM</h2>
<p>Each of us who has believed into the Lord Jesus has Him within us. He is within us, and He does not want us to do anything. This is altogether different from our religious concept. Our religious concept always tells us that we should do many things and that we should do our best to be a proper husband or wife. We have heard enough of these teachings. Now I would like to tell you in the Lord that the Lord Jesus within you does not want you to do anything. You are not able to do anything anyway, and even if you could, it would be worthless. The Lord tells us clearly in John 15, &ldquo;For apart from Me you can do nothing&rdquo; (v. 5b). However, I am afraid that many people believe that apart from the Lord they can do many things. It is true that apart from the Lord we can do many things. We can do things like lose our temper and throw things at others. If a wife is apart from the Lord, she may even steal her husband&rsquo;s money, and if a husband is apart from the Lord, he may even lie to his wife. We can do many things apart from the Lord; however, whatever we do is worthless. Therefore, the Lord said, &ldquo;Apart from Me you can do nothing.&rdquo; Hence, all of us should stop all of our doing. We need to resign from being humble and retire from loving others. Whether we are over sixty years old or we are teenagers, we must stop all of our doing. Even if we try to so something, it is useless, because apart from Him we can do nothing. The way to be blessed is to inwardly resign and retire from all of our doing. Then the Lord Jesus will be the One who is living with us. The Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (v. 4). He also said, &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live&rdquo; (14:19b). In saying these words, the Lord seemed to say, &ldquo;I want you to live in Me, and I want to live with you. You and I are meant to live and move together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believe that we have all heard this teaching before. However, we cannot deny that in our living there is not much of this experience. From now on, we must be strict concerning this matter. We must say, &ldquo;From now on it must be no longer I who lives. It must be Christ who lives in me. When I love others, I do not want to be the one who is loving them; rather, it must be Christ in me who is loving them. Even when I sing hymns or pray, it must be no longer I who pray and sing but Christ in me who is praying and singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Countless times young Christians have asked me whether or not they should do certain things. When asked questions of this kind, I often answer that it is not a matter of whether or not we can or cannot do something. What is important is that we ask the Lord. For example, if we want to go to a movie, we should simply say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, my going to the movie is Your going. I am going to see this movie in You.&rdquo; If we are able to say these words to the Lord, then we can go to the movie. When I answer the young people in this way, they often reply, &ldquo;I know that Jesus does not go to the movies, so I cannot say this. Thus, I cannot go to the movies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I use this example to show us that the real Christian life is not something that is out of ourselves. It is not out of our own doing or behaving. The real Christian life is the living of the Lord Jesus within us. It is His living, not our living. Many Christians have heard this teaching, but very few live it. My burden in fellowshipping with you concerning this matter is that today we would make the decision that our living will be the living of the Lord Jesus, that our living will be the Lord Jesus living in us.</p>
<p>Each one of us must see that the Lord has done a great thing. Not only has He solved our problem of sin on the cross, but He has also become the Spirit. As the Spirit He has entered into us. Now He desires to live for us and that we would live together with Him. This is the unique characteristic of a Christian. A normal Christian is one who has the Lord Jesus as the living Spirit living within his spirit. No Christian should live by himself. Every Christian should have Christ living within him. Thus, we all must stop our doing and stop our living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEEDING TO PRACTICE LIVING WITH THE LORD IN OUR DAILY LIVING</h2>
<p>Our need is to practice living with the Lord in our daily living. However, I know that in practice many of us neglect this. When we come to the meeting, the Lord should be coming in our coming; we should come to the meeting because the Lord in us is coming to the meeting. We must have one life, one living, and one move with the Lord. When we come to the meeting, we should have the real sense that we are not coming by ourselves but that the Lord and we are coming together.</p>
<p>The teaching that we hear in the meeting is very clear&mdash; we are dead and buried, and it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us. However, when we are in the midst of our busy lives, the Lord Jesus is not there. We are busy with many things all day, but the Lord Jesus is gone. Outwardly we may appear to be zealous Christians, but in reality the Lord is not present in all of our busyness. We may be so busy that it is not until we sit down in the meeting hall for the meeting that we discover that we have abandoned the Lord and that He is not with us.</p>
<p>We must see the vision that as saved ones the Lord is within us and is one with us. We cannot be separated from Him. He is our life within, and He does not want us to continue to live by ourselves. In our daily living, in matters great and small, we must learn to stop ourselves and say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You are here with me, and I am living by You.&rdquo; When it is time for a meeting, we must say to Him, &ldquo;Lord, You go to the meeting, and I will go with You. I will go to the meeting in You.&rdquo; If we pray in this way, we will spontaneously be living with the Lord when we enter into the meeting hall. As a result, we will not gossip, asking about this or that, because the Lord does not do this. When we are in the meeting, we will cooperate with the Lord and allow Him to flow out from within us to praise, testify, sing, or call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name. Today, the Lord needs a group of people on the earth who are like this.</p>
<p>Today we all need to repent and confess concerning one thing. We need to repent and confess to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, for years I have known that You are living in me, but for years I have not lived by You. Although I do not commit any great sins or do bad things, I do not live by You. Instead, I always live by myself.&rdquo; We all need to have this kind of repentance and confession. We also need to acknowledge that the Lord has suffered by being frustrated and limited within us. We need to confess to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You have not been able to flow out from within me because I have not lived by You. I am still I, and You are still You. I have not allowed You to be my life. Forgive me. Outwardly, it appears that I have not done anything wrong&mdash;I do not scold or offend my spouse&mdash; but in reality You are not my living, and I do not live You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s intention is not for us to be good or to improve ourselves. Of course, neither is it His intention for us to be evil or to do wicked things. The Lord&rsquo;s intention is that we would give Him the absolute opportunity to live in us. The Lord wants us to completely stop all of our doing and to take Him as our life, to live by Him, and to live with Him. Since this is the Lord&rsquo;s desire, we must forget about everything else. We must forget about our zeal, diligence, and all the good things or bad things about us; simply be one with the Lord within. We must understand, realize, and know absolutely that the Lord Jesus is within us as our life, Lord, person, God, patience, humility, love, strength, and everything. Then we must stop ourselves and live by Him. Even when we share in the meetings, we should have such a realization and practice. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, as I stand and speak, I do not want to be the one who is speaking. I will not take the old way of speaking by myself. When I speak, I will not speak; I will let You speak.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s desire today is to gain a group of people who are like this that they may be His witnesses on the earth.</p>
<p>At the end of the Gospel of John, John tells us that the God who was in the beginning, who became flesh, and who is also the Spirit, abides in us and we abide in Him. We and He, He and we, are united as one entity. He is the vine, and we are the branches; we and He are one. Our living is His living, and His living is our living. Our living allows Him to live out of us. For this we all need to go before the Lord, opening ourselves up, stopping all of our activities, and saying, &ldquo;Lord, now I see and realize that it is not a matter of whether I am good or bad. It is altogether a matter of Your living in me and of Your being lived out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire is only this&mdash;to work Himself into us to be our life and person and to be one with us. Today God has come into us to abide in us and to be our person. He desires that we would live Him, that is, live by Him, live with Him, and walk together with Him. Every time that I stand up to speak for the Lord, I inwardly exercise faith and say, &ldquo;Lord, as I speak, You are speaking in my speaking. I am not speaking by myself. I have nothing to say in myself, so when I speak, You speak in my speaking. Lord, You and I, I and You, are united. When I open my mouth, speak through me, and when I speak, flow out through me.&rdquo; We should be this way when we give a message and in our daily living. Every action in our living should be done in one accord with the Lord. When we love, the Lord should flow out of our love. When we are humble, the Lord should flow out of our humility. Every action that we take in our daily living should be the Lord living Himself out through us. I have spoken concerning this matter again and again, but many of us still have not opened ourselves to receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace to live entirely in this reality. May the Lord have mercy on us to wake us up out of our stupor that we would see clearly that we should not live or do, but that the Lord Jesus&mdash;the great God who is inside of us, who has become our life, who has put us on, and who is joined with us&mdash;should be the One who is living and doing. Our living must be His living, our speaking must be His speaking, and our moving must be His moving.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR NEEDING TO DO TWO THINGS<br />
TO LIVE WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>What do we need to do in order to live this kind of life? What do we need to do in order to live by and with the Lord and to abide together with Him? We need to do only two things. In telling you these two things, I do not wish to give you methods; my intention is simply to tell you the way to live this kind of life. First, we must always be open to the Lord. The easiest way to open to the Lord is to learn to open up our whole being&mdash;our spirit, our heart, and even our mouth. We need to learn to open up our whole being and call on the name of the Lord, calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; We must learn to open ourselves to the Lord and to call on name of the Lord. This is the simplest and the best way. This way causes us to meet and touch the Lord. The best way to meet and touch the Lord is not to ponder or meditate on the Lord; the best way is to open ourselves to the Lord by calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Each of us should practice this a little at home. We do not need to be very loud; neither do we need to scream and yell in a crazy way. We need simply to learn to open ourselves up to the Lord and to call on His name. The Bible says that the Lord is rich to all who call upon Him (Rom. 10:12). The Lord is living and real. Moreover, He is within us. When we call on Him, opening ourselves to Him, we will contact Him within.</p>
<p>The second thing that we need to do in order to live with the Lord is to contact the Lord&rsquo;s word in a proper way. The way to do this is to genuinely pray-read and eat His word. To eat the Lord&rsquo;s word is to eat the Lord Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEEDING TO SEE AND TO LIVE THIS VISION</h2>
<p>Every one of us must see the simple vision that the Lord Jesus is the all-inclusive Spirit dwelling in our spirit. Then we must live by the Lord, daily receiving His supply, contacting Him, and being joined to Him. This requires us to open our entire being to Him from deep within. Opening to the Lord in this way is exceedingly easy. We simply need to call on His name and pray-read His word. We can use our spirit to contact the word, to eat the word, and to receive the word into us. We can also use the word to pray to Him, to seek Him, and to fellowship with Him. If daily and moment by moment we contact Him anew, receiving His fresh supply, we will be continuously refreshed, nourished, enlightened, and supplied within. Then we will be able to live, move, and walk in Him in spirit at all times. This is what the Lord desires.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John has twenty-one chapters. Together these chapters reveal that the eternal God became flesh to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption on our behalf. This entire Gospel also unveils that after this God entered into death, He came out of death and was transfigured to be the life-giving Spirit to enter into our spirit to live and move with us. In light of this we should consecrate ourselves to Him, stopping all of our own living and moving, and open up to Him by calling on His name, eating His word, and contacting Him, so that He can supply us and cause us to walk in newness of life. The Lord desires to gain such a group of people on the earth today. By living in this way we will not only have been regenerated and redeemed, we will also be in the process of being transformed. Day after day He will change our nature into His very nature and conform us into His very image. Then one day He will bring us into glory and all of us will be built up together to be His exceedingly glorious expression.</p>
<p>May our eyes be opened to see this one matter, and may we open our heart and spirit to Him and say, &ldquo;Lord, I stop everything. You are not only my life, You are also my living. May my inner being contact You moment by moment and constantly receive Your supply, so that in my daily living You and I will live as one entity.&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRACTICING LIVING WITH THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 21:22; Gal. 2:20a, 4:19; 2 Tim. 4:22a; 1 Cor. 6:17; Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WONDERFUL LORD<br />
BEING THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Bible is a wonderful book. It is wonderful because it is a record of the wonderful Lord Jesus. As those who believe in Him, love Him, fellowship with Him, and draw near to Him daily, we can testify that the more we experience Him, the more we sense that He is rich and wonderful. His mysteriousness is far beyond comprehension. In the two thousand years of the history of the church, countless people have believed into Him, worshipped Him, and followed Him, yet no one can fully describe who He is or thoroughly experience Him.</p>
<p>By reading church history and the biographies of many famous Christians, we can see that there are many who have had amazing experiences of the Lord Jesus throughout the past two thousand years. Today the more we experience the Lord, the more we discover that the one item that is most precious and lovable about Him is that, as the Lord of all creation and the omnipotent God, He has passed through creation, redemption, death, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the life-giving Spirit, He is not only in the third heavens and all around us, He is also in our spirit to be our life, nature, and everything. The Lord&rsquo;s desire today is that we would receive Him as our life, and live, move, and walk by Him and with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR BEING SHORT OF THE REALITY<br />
OF LIVING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>For years we have been speaking and releasing messages as well as publishing books on this matter. However, our burden has still not been discharged. Why has our burden not been discharged? It has not been discharged because this matter is too mysterious. It is definitely not something that can be grasped merely by a little outward understanding. Even if we were to give our entire life, we still would not be able to thoroughly experience the Lord as the Spirit. The second reason that our burden has not been discharged is that, more or less, we tend to lean toward outward things rather than emphasizing the inner life. We must thank the Lord that among us there are many brothers and sisters who love the Lord and have fellowship with Him. We must also thank the Lord that the testimony of the church has been raised up in many places. Nevertheless, we must bow our heads and confess from the depths of our being that there is still a great lack in the churches in every locality. There is not the daily reality of living in spirit and of living with the Lord. We all have to admit that every saint in every church is short of the reality of the experience of living with the Lord.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that I am living together with a brother who is a good friend of mine. If I truly consider him to be my good friend, whenever I have the time and the opportunity, I will definitely greet him and talk to him. If I ignore him, only taking care of my own business and putting him aside, what kind of friend am I? If I were to do this, he would surely feel that I am cold toward him. He would also think that something must have happened between us and that I no longer like him. Most likely he would ask me how he had offended me. Suppose I were to answer him, &ldquo;You have not offended me! I have just been too busy and too tired, and I have had many other things that I needed to do.&rdquo; Even if I were to explain at length why I had been ignoring him, he would not believe that it was only because I had been busy, because to ignore a good friend for this reason is unreasonable and insensitive.</p>
<p>We all admit that the Lord Jesus is real, living, and concrete, that He is with us and is living in us, that He is our life and our everything, and that He wants us to live by Him and with Him. Since we all admit this, I would ask, how much of the last six hours have we spent paying attention to the Lord Jesus? We have heard all the teachings and do not need any new teaching. What we need is the practical outworking in our living of what we have heard. As I consider and reconsider, I feel more and more that in our practical daily living, nothing is more real and more important than living with the Lord Jesus. As the all-inclusive Spirit, He lives in our spirit and desires that we would live with Him.</p>
<p>Some may say that I am giving these messages in order to review the subjects of calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s word. They may think that I am giving make-up lessons on these two topics because we are all very short in the real experience of calling and pray-reading. However, this is not the case. I am not giving these messages for the purpose of giving you make-up lessons. I am giving them to nourish you. You have not been eating much these past few years. Therefore, I feel that I need to be more practical and that I should not give you profound teachings. My burden is to concentrate entirely on giving you substantial and practical nourishment.</p>
<p>Recently I asked a certain brother whether or not he practices every day to live with the Lord. He answered that he does have this kind of exercise but that he does not exercise in this way every day. He also added that when he does exercise in this way, it may be for only half an hour in a given day. If a person breathes for only half an hour each day, will he be able to survive? I give this illustration to show you that everything that we are doing today in the churches in every locality has become a religion. It is true that meetings, messages, singing, and praying are all means of contacting the Lord. However, when they do not help us to contact the Lord, they have become something of religion. Whether or not a practice has become something of religion does not depend on the practice itself. We cannot say that arranging the chairs in a circle so that we face one another in our meetings is not something of religion or that for one person to speak to everyone else from a tall platform is something of religion. We also cannot say that you are religious if you do not pray and read the Bible or that you are not religious if you do in fact do these things. These various practices are not in themselves the issue. Whether or not a certain practice, such as reading the word, praying, meeting, and singing, has become something of religion depends upon whether or not we are genuinely touching the Lord when we do it.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR NEEDING THE REAL PRACTICE<br />
OF LIVING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>In the book of Genesis there is a person named Enoch. He walked with God for three hundred years. Today, however, we are not only walking with the Lord but also living with the Lord. God was outside of Enoch while Enoch walked with God, but today the Lord is within us, and we live with Him. The Lord is our life and our person, and we are living with Him.</p>
<p>We need to have the real practice of living with the Lord, not only living with Him in the meetings, but also in our daily lives&mdash;in our home, on the street, and at our office. We should not only receive this teaching; we should practice it and live it. We must pay attention to the Lord Jesus. We must not put Him aside. We should not abandon the Lord Jesus when we get busy and then eighteen hours later come to the realization that we have left Him and hurriedly pray, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me for not drawing near to You,&rdquo; and then three minutes later go back to our busy life of not living with the Lord.</p>
<p>The focal revelation in the Bible shows us that our Lord, our God, has done everything. He passed through death, entered into resurrection, and having completed everything, ascended into the heavens. Now there is only one thing left for Him to accomplish. He wants to enter into us to be our life, to live with us, and to have us live by Him. Today He is in us in a real and practical way. This glorious God, who is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;and Jehovah, is living in our spirit. This is not a doctrine but a glorious fact. Our Savior, who is the expression of God the Great, is in our spirit today to be our life and to live with us. What we need is not the understanding of this teaching but the practice of this living. If we love the Lord sincerely and genuinely, then from now on our top priority should be to practice living with the Lord. Every one of the saints should say, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on the church where I am. From now on I will not practice anything else except living with the Lord.&rdquo; We need to have this start in our personal life. The local church that we are in also needs to have this start.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THAT WE ARE BEING JUST AN OUTWARD SHELL AND CHRIST BEING OUR UNIQUE CONTENT</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is real and living. He is living right inside of us. In the winter many of us wear gloves. A glove is made to look exactly like a hand, except that a glove is empty. A glove is an exterior covering. The reality of the glove is the hand. According to the revelation in the Bible, every created human being is a hollow shell. Our mind and intellect, our will, and our emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight are all shells. All of our desires are also shells. In fact, our entire life and our whole being are an outward shell. When God Himself enters into us, He becomes our content and the reality of our life and being. The God who enters into us is Jesus Christ as the life-giving Spirit. He is the reality of God. We are a shell, and God desires to enter into us to fill every part of our being. First He enters into our spirit. Then He fills our mind, our emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight, and our will with its power. Outwardly we are but a shell. Christ is meant to be our inward content.</p>
<p>Since we are a shell, our content must be Christ. He has already entered into us to be the content of our spirit, so now we need to live by Him and with Him every day. We should not wait until just before we come to the meeting in the evening to pray to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I am going to the meeting. Lord, do remember this meeting, take care of the brothers and sisters, and take care of me.&rdquo; If we have not prayed all day, it is too late for this kind of prayer. This kind of prayer is religious prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO PRACTICE LIVING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>Since we should not wait until just before the meeting to pray, what then should we do? When we wake up in the morning, it is not necessary to purposely kneel down. While we are brushing our teeth, washing our face, and getting dressed, we can begin living with the Lord by contacting Him, praying, &ldquo;Lord, what will You do today? Lord, how will You lead me today?&rdquo; The minute we wake up, we can contact the Lord. The best way to do this is by calling on the Lord&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord! O Lord Jesus! What do You want me to do today? How do You want me to live by You today? O Lord! How will You lead me today?&rdquo; If we simply communicate with the Lord in this way, gradually over time we will have the practice of contacting the Lord. Then whenever we are thinking, we will say, &ldquo;Lord, I am going to use my mind. My mind is an empty shell. Your mind is the real content. Lord Jesus, come and think for me. I want Your mind to be my mind. O Lord, do think over this matter in me. In this matter, let Your mind fill my mind.&rdquo; This is very clear. When we go to the store to shop, we should not speak to the salesperson on our own. We must say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I ask You to speak. Lead me in my speaking.&rdquo; In everything we must let the Lord come in. When we need to think, we must allow the Lord to think for us. We should not depend upon our own mind. When we are about to use our emotions, we need to open ourselves to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, come in now! Are You happy? Are You sad? O Lord Jesus! My emotions are just a shell that needs Your filling.&rdquo; We also need to allow the Lord to come into our will to fill our will and to make decisions in us.</p><h2 class="head1">INQUIRING OF THE LORD IN ALL THINGS<br />
AND DOING EVERYTHING WITH HIM</h2>
<p>Today our greatest lack is that we do not exercise to live with the Lord. We all need this kind of exercise. If you go to buy a suit, you should say, &ldquo;Lord, what should I do in this situation? Which kind of material do you think that I should get? Should I buy this style or that style?&rdquo; Those of us who love the Lord and are of the Lord are truly different from the rest of the people on the earth. Those who do not love the Lord and are not of the Lord are merely who they are in themselves and nothing more. As such, they are under Satan&rsquo;s hand. We, however, are different. We are not solely who we are in ourselves. We have the Lord Jesus living with us. He lives in our mind, emotion, will, wisdom, and in our entire being. Since the Lord is with us and in us, we must allow Him to live in our living.</p>
<p>We all need to make the decision to practice to live with the Lord. Making this decision is like signing our name to an agreement. Once we have made this decision, it is as if we have signed our name. From that time on we must have this practice. It is not enough to practice only when we are pray-reading or when we are in a meeting. We must practice in our daily living. When a sister speaks to her husband, she should not think in her heart, &ldquo;Since I am not talking to the president or to a judge but only to my husband, it is does not matter how I speak.&rdquo; The married sisters should not think this way. It is probably true that your husband is not the president or a judge, but the Lord Jesus is within you while you are speaking to your husband. The Lord Jesus is higher than the president. He is within you as life, and He wants you to live by Him. When you are about to converse with your husband, you must check with the Lord within. You should say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, how would You speak? In this situation be my thinking, my joy, my anger, my sorrow, my delight, and my everything.&rdquo; This is the practical way to exercise to live with the Lord. In every matter, great or small, we must exercise to take the Lord Jesus as our life. This is our destiny&mdash;to live by the Lord Jesus moment by moment, to live constantly with the Lord.</p>
<p>When you are about to lose your temper, immediately you should call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I am about to lose my temper. Please come and lose Your temper!&rdquo; You have to invite the Lord Jesus to lose your temper for you. Sisters often give their husbands a long face. However, from now on whenever you are about to have a long face, right away you should call, &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; If you want the Lord to live with you, you also have to live with the Lord. I also suggest to the brothers that whenever you are about to give a message, you must exercise to live with the Lord by praying, &ldquo;O Lord, You give this message!&rdquo; You should never again give a message that the Lord Jesus is not giving, and you should never again give a message with words that the Lord who is in you would not say. You have to live with the Lord. If the Lord does not speak, you should by no means speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT,<br />
WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT,<br />
AND FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Lord uses our spirit as the base. Our experience tells us that we can drive the Lord out of our mind, out of our emotions, and even out of the message that we are giving. However, we can never drive the Lord out of our spirit. He is in our spirit, and we cannot chase Him out. This is wonderful. No matter what, He always remains in our spirit. Perhaps then you would ask me, &ldquo;Since the Lord Jesus does not go away, why is my spirit still depressed sometimes?&rdquo; Your spirit is depressed because the Lord Jesus in your spirit is depressed. You should remember that whenever your spirit is low, it is low because the Lord Jesus in your spirit is low. He has no way out of our spirit because you have forced Him to be depressed.</p>
<p>When you live by the Lord, do not believe in your feelings and do not exercise your mind. Rather, you should exercise your spirit. Within you there is a spirit. A child does not initially understand that he has legs, but when you put him on the floor, eventually he will use his legs and begin to crawl. There is no need for you to teach a child to stand, for eventually he will stand up on his two legs. He does not understand his legs, yet he knows how to use them. In the same way, it does not matter how little you know about your spirit; you still know how to use your spirit. Do not think too much and do not go by your emotions, being happy when you are stirred up and downhearted when you are not. Do not pay attention to these things. Simply mind your spirit.</p>
<p>It is the same when you are praying. When you pray, do not pay attention to your thoughts and do not stay in your mind. Pray quick and simple prayers from your spirit, using just two to three sentences to hit the point. When many brothers and sisters pray, they go on and on, uttering long, wordy, and aimless prayers. Imagine if you were the Lord listening to this kind of prayer. Would not your patience run out? Instead of depending on your wordiness, pray by the spirit. Do not give histories or speak doctrines when you pray. If you feel that the Lord is lovely, just say, &ldquo;Lord, You are so lovely. I love You.&rdquo; That is enough; there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>I have discovered that some of you have a new way of singing. You pick only one hymn, and then you pray-sing it verse by verse. I am not criticizing or correcting you. I wish only to say that there should not be any method to our singing. Everything and everyone should be according to spirit with no set method. Perhaps today when we sing a hymn, we may pray-read the whole hymn. Then perhaps tomorrow after we finish singing the hymn, we may not pray-read at all. The hymn singing should be something living. It should not be according to any set way. This does not mean that you should purposely learn different ways to sing, because the different ways that you learn would also become set ways. Every one of us should learn to live in spirit with the Lord. There is no need to have a set method in picking hymns, singing hymns, or pray-reading, because we are all living with the Lord.</p>
<p>In our daily living, it is easy to live alone. For example, it may be quite convenient for a young lady to live and walk by herself. However, once she gets married, her life as a married person may become more difficult. The husband has his ways, and the wife also has her ways. A married person has to live his life with another person. Our Lord&rsquo;s living with us is even more involved than the living together of a husband and wife, for He is living right within us. No matter how close your husband is to you, he cannot live inside of you, and he cannot be your life or your person. However, our Lord lives inside of us to be our person. Thus, we absolutely must exercise to have the habit of going along with Him rather than having Him go along with us.</p>
<p>The Lord told Peter, &ldquo;You follow Me&rdquo; (John 21:22b). When the Lord said this, He was already in resurrection, and shortly after He said this, He ascended to the heavens. Once the Lord ascended to the heavens, how could Peter follow Him? Peter could follow the Lord because the Lord not only ascended to the heavens, He also entered into Peter. How do we follow the Lord today? Someone once told me, &ldquo;The way to follow the Lord is to do whatever the Lord did. He left us a model.&rdquo; Gradually, I discovered that this is the religious way. Today the Lord lives in our spirit, so whenever He makes a move in our spirit, we just follow. This is the way to follow the Lord.</p>
<p>You and I are no longer single today. We all have this wonderful One living in us to be our life and our person. He wants us to put ourselves aside completely and to live by Him. Our mind should be filled with His mind, and our emotions should be filled with His emotions. He wants our entire being and our entire living to be filled with His element. He can sympathize with us, but He does not want to take our way. Thus, we must learn from Him and follow Him. He is in our spirit, so we also have to learn to release our spirit, exercise our spirit, use our spirit, and turn back to our spirit. Each time we turn back to our spirit, we touch the Lord, because the Lord is there. I hope that the brothers and sisters do not take this only as a teaching. Instead, I hope that you would promise to practice, to exercise, living with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT CEASING TO CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>According to my experience, I suggest that if you want to live by the Lord, you should not cease calling on the name of the Lord. You must call on the name of the Lord continually. Besides this there is no other way. Do not think that calling on the name of the Lord is of no importance. The Lord&rsquo;s name is real, for His name denotes His person. If a certain brother is dead or not present, then for me to call his name is useless. However, if he is real, living, and present, then when I call him, he will come to me right away. Jesus is our Lord&rsquo;s name, and the Spirit is His person. Once you call &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the Spirit is here. Do you want to receive the life-giving Spirit? Just call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; When you call, He comes.</p>
<p>Perhaps you would say that this is all superstition. If you believe this, then let us call on the philosophers. Let us say, &ldquo;O Plato! O Socrates, where are you? O Confucius, I love you!&rdquo; You may love these ones and call upon their names, but they will not respond. But if you simply call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; mysteriously you will be filled with feeling within. The more you call, the more feeling you will have. Why is it that when you call on a philosopher or a sage, you have no feeling within, but when you call on the Lord Jesus, you do? This is because all the philosophers are dead and are not here. Only the Lord Jesus died but lives again. He is real, He is living, and He is experiential. He is right here, and He is even inside of you. When you call on Him, your spirit will be released. However, all calling is not the same. If while remaining in your mind, you call with your mouth&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo;&mdash;nothing will happen. When some electrical switches are turned on, the electrical current comes in right away. However, when other electrical switches are turned on, the electrical current still does not come. This illustrates that not all calling is the same. Never think that calling on the Lord is a superstition. It is a spiritual reality. Our Lord is the Spirit today within our spirit. When we call on Him from our spirit&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! I love You!&rdquo;&mdash;there is such a sweetness within. Even when you are reading the Bible, do not use your mind to think. Call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; as you read, and you will be refreshed within. This is the way to call on the name of the Lord and to pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s word. I hope that every brother and sister would practice this kind of living with the Lord every day. In all the churches all the brothers and sisters should be led to live in this practice of living with the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING WITH THE LORD BY LOVING HIM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 14:23; 1 John 2:27-28; Eph. 3:16-19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING WITH THE LORD BEING A STORY OF LOVE</h2>
<p>Living with the Lord is not a matter of coercion. Living with the Lord is according to the same principle as that of marriage life, which is not based upon coercion but upon love. It is truly painful for two people to live together without the sweetness of love and without being maintained in love. The Bible also likens our living with the Lord to the living of a husband and wife in love. Our Beloved is the Lord Jesus whom we love, and we are His lovers. We are bound together with Him by the sweetness of love. Of the sixty-six books of the Bible, one book&mdash;Song of Songs&mdash;speaks exclusively about the loving relationship between the Beloved and His lovers. From beginning to end, Song of Songs talks about our living a life of love and mutual attraction with the Lord.</p>
<p>In John 14:23 the Lord says, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me.&rdquo; All religions, including Christianity, stress respect toward God and fear of God. They state that God is fearful, so man should fear Him. Some religions also speak of worshipping God. These religions assert that since God is great and exalted, man must worship Him. Religion teaches primarily these two things&mdash;fearing and worshipping God. The words spoken by the Lord Jesus, however, do not stress fear, worship, or even adoration. Adoration is something that someone who is inferior has for someone who is superior. Instead of stressing these things, the Lord Jesus spoke of love. Love is something that is shared by two people who have an equal standing and are on the same level. The love between a husband and a wife is a love between equals. In such a relationship it cannot be that one is higher and the other is lower, one is superior and the other is inferior. The Lord Jesus did not say, &ldquo;If anyone adores Me,&rdquo; He did not say, &ldquo;If anyone worships Me,&rdquo; and He did not say, &ldquo;If anyone fears Me.&rdquo; Fear, worship, and adoration are all, more or less, related to religion. Our Lord is not a religion or merely an object of worship. He is a living Person.</p>
<p>Our Lord is the ever-living God and the almighty Sovereign of the universe. It is true that He is God, but this God also became flesh, put on humanity, and took on our nature. As a man He died and resurrected, and today He still has His humanity, a resurrected humanity, and He is still Jesus, the Son of Man. Therefore, 1 Timothy 2:5b says, &ldquo;The man Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Today our God&mdash;the Lord of the universe and our Savior&mdash;is still a man. Even though He became the life-giving Spirit, He still has the human nature. Thus, He can speak to us about love, something that is shared between those of equal rank. He says, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me.&rdquo; When we come to this section of the Bible, we may not treasure the word <em>love.</em> We have to realize that the love spoken of here is something more that adoration, fear, or worship. This love is something shared by two who are on the same level. We are human, and He also is human. We have the human nature, and He also has put on the human nature. He has come to our level. He is not standing above us. He is standing in front of us, on our level, saying to us, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Lord rose from the dead, He immediately went to find Peter, the one who had denied Him to His face. On the night that the Lord Jesus was betrayed, Peter was full of confidence that he would follow the Lord. However, when the test came, Peter denied the Lord three times right to His face (Luke 22:55-61). Shortly after this, the Lord Jesus was crucified and then resurrected. After the Lord had resurrected, an angel told Mary the Magdalene and two other sisters to &ldquo;go, tell His disciples and Peter&rdquo; (Mark 16:7). Peter forsook the Lord, but the Lord did not forget Peter. I believe that after Peter denied the Lord, he regretted to the uttermost that he had done so, saying to himself, &ldquo;How could I have denied the Lord three times?&rdquo; However, at the very juncture when Peter must have been feeling this way, Mary came and said, &ldquo;Peter, the Lord wants me to tell something to the brothers and to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In John 21 the Lord manifested Himself to the disciples. While He was manifesting Himself to them, He found time to speak to Peter face to face. He questioned Peter three times, asking him, &ldquo;Simon, son of John, do you love Me?&rdquo; (vv. 15-17). I believe that the Lord asked Peter this question three times because Peter had denied the Lord three times. The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;You denied Me three times, saying, &lsquo;No! No! No!&rsquo; Now let Me ask you also three times, &lsquo;Do you? Do you? Do you?&rsquo;&rdquo; First the Lord asked Peter, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; Then he asked him, &ldquo;Do you love Me?&rdquo; And the third time He asked him again, &ldquo;Do you love Me?&rdquo; Peter found it difficult to answer these questions. Just a few days earlier he had denied the Lord, so how could he now say, &ldquo;Yes, Lord, I really love You&rdquo;? At the same time, he could not say, &ldquo;Lord, I do not love You.&rdquo; Peter was probably thinking, &ldquo;If I say that I do not love the Lord, I will be lying. I do love Him, but my love for Him is so poor. What is my real situation? Only the Lord knows whether or not I truly love Him!&rdquo; Therefore, Peter answered the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You know that I love You.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">EVERY SAVED ONE HAVING A HEART<br />
TO LOVE THE LORD</h2>
<p>Now I would ask you, &ldquo;Do you love the Lord?&rdquo; I believe that like Peter many of the brothers and sisters would say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You know that I love You.&rdquo; In every believer there is a heart to love the Lord. How do you know that you have believed into the Lord Jesus and that God has accepted you? How do you know that the Lord lives in you? How do you know that you are one with the Lord? We do not know these things by touching the Lord outwardly. We often hear the saints say, &ldquo;Once I believed into the Lord, I touched the Lord. Once I believed into the Lord, I gained the Lord. Since I believed into the Lord, the Lord has been with me. Since I believed into the Lord, the Lord has never left me.&rdquo; As a result of hearing such statements and understanding them according to their human intellect, some expect to be able to touch the Lord Jesus outwardly. This, however, is the human understanding, the human concept. The Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit. He is a mystery.</p>
<p>The Spirit is a mystery, but there are several matters that illustrate the Spirit. One such matter is electricity. Electricity is very practical and is an essential part of modern living, but we cannot see it or touch it. Another mystery is our physical life. No one has ever been able to thoroughly define life. Because we have life within us, we are able to speak and move. However, once a person dies, although all of his inward parts are still within him, he is no longer able to function. Death is the cessation of the function of life. When someone dies, where does his life go? It is difficult to say. Life is a mystery. Therefore, the Bible reveals that our Lord is life to us. He is our life&mdash;He is real, practical, and almighty, yet we cannot touch Him. Although life cannot be touched, its presence is discernible. If I am standing before you, do I need to tell you that I have life? I do not, because when you see me standing before you, you know that I am living. Likewise, how do you know that you have believed into Jesus and are saved, and how do you know that Jesus is in you? You know because you have been enlivened within. There is something within you that you cannot remove. I was saved at a young age. After I had been saved, whenever I heard someone say something negative about Jesus, I would become very unhappy. Later I understood that this was proof that the Lord Jesus had come into me.</p>
<p>Outwardly you may not appear to love the Lord very much, yet deep within you, there is a feeling that the Lord is sweet and that you like Him. Perhaps you may not yet know how to love the Lord and, according to your inner feeling, you do not feel that you love Him. Nevertheless, there is still a sense hidden deep within you that Jesus is good, and every time you think about Jesus, you feel that He is good and that you like Him. If this is your sense within, this is proof that you are saved.</p>
<p>You may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, do not try to fool me. If I am saved as you say, why is it that I still like to play mah-jongg and go to the Chinese opera? Surely, I am not saved.&rdquo; In response I would say that while I do not encourage you to do these things, I am not concerned about them. I only ask you whether or not you have the inner sense that Jesus is good. When Jesus is mentioned, do you have the inner feeling that you like Him? Do you sense that Jesus is lovable? It may even be that while you are playing mah-jongg, while your fingers are on the tiles, a thought arises within you&mdash;&ldquo;Jesus is good.&rdquo; It may also be that while you are at the Chinese opera, while the stage is filled with exciting things, the statement arises within&mdash;&ldquo;Jesus is truly good.&rdquo; Moreover, regardless of how hard you try to get rid of this sense, you are not able to do so. The fact that you have this feeling within that Jesus is good proves that you are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SENSE THAT THE LORD IS LOVABLE INCREASING THE MORE WE EXPRESS OUR LOVE FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>I hope that the sense that Jesus is good is growing within you every day. You do not need to determine to give up mah-jongg or the Chinese opera. All that you need to do is to daily say, &ldquo;Jesus is good; Jesus is really good! Although I am here playing mah-jongg, Jesus is better than mah-jongg. Jesus is truly good!&rdquo; If you say this more and more every day, by the time that you have said this hundreds of times, you will no longer play mah-jongg or go to the opera. You will give up these things, because Jesus is good, and Jesus is so lovable.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, please do not think that it is superstitious to say this. I began hearing sermons in Christianity when I was very young, and although I have heard many of them, no one ever clearly told me that we should confess, &ldquo;Jesus is good! Jesus is so good! O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! Lord, You are so good!&rdquo; Then one day when I was compiling the hymnal, I found a hymn that says, &ldquo;O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord! / Forgive me if I say, / For very love, Thy sacred name / A thousand times a day&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #208). These lines deeply touched me. I said to the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, I am truly sorry. I have been saved for so many years, but I have never said Your name a thousand times in one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some say that calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; is almost the same as the Buddhists&rsquo; chanting &ldquo;Amitabha.&rdquo; However, the real situation is that the more the Buddhist priests and nuns chant &ldquo;Amitabha,&rdquo; the more their faces become downcast, the more their foreheads grow wrinkled, and the more their countenances become sorrowful. Even the rooms that the Buddhist priests and nuns live in are dark and gloomy. When they walk into them, they cannot see anything. Calling upon the name of the Lord is completely different from the chanting of the Buddhists. When you say &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! You are so good!&rdquo; from morning to night, your sad face turns into a smiling face, your downcast face becomes an uplifted face, your furrowed brow loosens up, your wrinkles diminish, and even your bedroom is filled with warmth. How amazing this is! Why is there such a contrast between calling on the Lord and chanting? It is because when the Buddhists call &ldquo;Amitabha,&rdquo; demons come. The more they say &ldquo;Amitabha,&rdquo; the more demons there are, and demons are gloomy. However, when we say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! You are so lovable!&rdquo; the Lord Jesus comes, and the more we say this, the more He comes. The Lord Jesus is the reality of every positive thing in this universe. Thus, when He comes, we have everything.</p>
<p>Everyone who has seen a diamond loves it because diamonds are lovable. However, if you bring me a handful of dirt, how do you expect me to love it? I may be genuinely willing to love it, but I cannot love it because it is not lovable. We love the Lord Jesus not because we know how, but because He is truly lovable. This is the reason that millions of people treasure the name of Jesus. Whenever the name of Jesus is mentioned, there is a feeling of sweetness and love within them. We may think that only little children call upon the Lord, but even I, an elderly man who is over seventy years old, call out &ldquo;I love the Lord Jesus&rdquo; every day. Our Lord Jesus is so wonderful.</p><h2 class="head1">LOVING THE LORD RESULTING IN<br />
LIVING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>Do we love the Lord Jesus? Since we all love Him, we should live with Him. Suppose there is a brother who has not taken a shower for three days, and his entire body smells. If this were the case, it would be difficult for me to love him and live with him. For two people to live together, they must love one another, and in order to love one another, they must find each other lovable. Our Lord Jesus is truly lovable. Formerly, we were not lovable, but the lovable Jesus has made us lovable. Thus, not only is Jesus lovable, but He has also made every one of His lovers lovable.</p>
<p>I know that this is true. I have seen people who were great sinners. Before they were saved, they were like monsters. Then one day they believed in the Lord and called, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Within two or three days after they believed in the Lord, they became most lovable. The loveliness of Jesus made them lovable. This illustrates that if you love Jesus, you will become lovable. Moreover, your loving Him and your becoming lovable will produce a result. Because He is lovable and you have become lovable, and because He loves you and you love Him, the two of you will live together. Because you love one another, you will want to live together all day long. Because He is truly lovable, and you love Him, you will want to see Him often and live with Him. He is your life, and you are His image. You and He, He and you, will then become one. He loves you, and you love Him, so the two of you will live together.</p>
<p>In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me,...My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; The Lord does not say that the Father and the Son will merely visit us and say &ldquo;hello.&rdquo; He says that They will make an abode with us. For the Father and Son to make an abode with us means that They will live, walk, and move together with us. It is truly amazing that the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me,...My Father will love him.&rdquo; Our love for Him is not a love of someone who is below for someone who is above, and His love for us is not a love from someone who is above for someone who is below. Our love for Him and His love for us is a love shared by two who are on an equal standing. This is the Christian life.</p>
<p>What follows such a love? What follows is a life of living with the Lord. The Christian life is a life of living with the Lord and a life of the Lord living with us. Eventually, we will live together with the Lord to such an extent that when we say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, let us go to the movies together!&rdquo;, we will be able to sense the Lord saying, &ldquo;I am not going!&rdquo; Moreover, not only will we sense that the Lord does not want to go, but we will also say, &ldquo;Lord, You do not want to go? Since You do not want to go, then I will not go. What would You like to do?&rdquo; We may say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, they are playing mah-jongg at Mr. Lee&rsquo;s, but they are short one person. Can we go play mah-jongg?&rdquo; And when the Lord says, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;, then we will not go. However, when there is a special gospel meeting, we may say to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, tonight there is a special meeting at the stadium. Shall we go there?&rdquo; Then when the Lord says, &ldquo;Yes, let us go!&rdquo;, we will say, &ldquo;Okay, Lord. Let us go together.&rdquo; This is to live with the Lord. We say, &ldquo;Lord, I have not had a haircut in four weeks, should I go get a haircut today?&rdquo; Then if the Lord says, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;, we say, &ldquo;Then which barber shop should I go to?&rdquo; This is the Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT&rsquo;S STRENGTHENING,<br />
CHRIST&rsquo;S MAKING HIS HOME, AND GOD&rsquo;S FILLING</h2>
<p>We need to see that the Christian life is not a matter of self-cultivation, self-improvement, or anything other than loving the Lord and allowing Him to live with us. The Lord wants to live with us, but the question is whether or not we love Him and are fond of Him. This is why Paul prayed to the Father in Ephesians 3:16, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&rdquo; Paul did not pray for us to be prosperous, for our business to thrive, or for everything to go smoothly with us. He prayed for us to be strengthened into the inner man. When our inner man, our regenerated spirit, is strengthened, it is completely open, and when our spirit is open, the Lord can fill us and spread from our spirit into every part of our heart, including our mind, emotion, and will. This is the way that Christ makes His home in our hearts (v. 17). He does so by filling our spirit and taking possession of our heart.</p>
<p>Do we love the Lord? We must thank the Lord that we do indeed love Him. However, although we love Him, we have not given Him much room in our mind. The Lord is still standing before a closed door and is not able to enter in. We continue to garrison our heart, not giving Him entrance. It is as if we are saying to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, please do not come in. Do not come into my mind. This is not a through street. Just remain in my spirit.&rdquo; This may be our condition. Our spirit may be like a living room in which we have politely asked the Lord Jesus to stay. After a long while, however, the living room of our spirit turns into a prison. We imprison the Lord in our spirit and do not allow Him to take one step out of our spirit. Thus, we need the Spirit to strengthen our inner man by His power, causing our spirit to become strong.</p>
<p>How do we allow the Spirit to strengthen our inner man by His power? The direct way to do this is to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! I love You! O Lord Jesus, I love You!&rdquo; After you have exercised like this for five to ten minutes, the strongest part of your being will be your spirit, and your strengthened spirit will be filled with the Lord Jesus. Furthermore, the Lord Jesus will now have the way to spread from your spirit into your mind, emotion, and will. As you call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo;, your spirit will be filled with Him step by step, and a sense will arise within you, causing you to realize that you have not allowed the Lord to possess your mind, your emotion, and your will and to take away your opinions. If you continue to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo;, the indwelling Christ in your spirit will gradually fill your mind, emotion, and will. Your experience will prove this. Eventually, after one day, two days, one week, or one month, your whole being will be possessed by the Lord. This is the way that Christ makes His home in our heart.</p>
<p>By being strengthened into our inner man through calling on the Lord, we will experience what is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe (v. 18). We will discover that the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are all the Lord Jesus. The breadth, length, height, and depth are all infinite, and all of these infinite measurements are the Lord Jesus. The breadth is the Lord Jesus, the length is the Lord Jesus, the height is the Lord Jesus, and the depth is the Lord Jesus. We will discover that the Lord&rsquo;s patience is endless. Our patience is at most twelve inches long. If someone offends us two inches, we can be patient. If someone offends us four inches, we can stretch the elastic band of our patience. If someone offends us eight inches, we can still stretch it a little more. If someone offends us twelve inches, we will be stretched to our maximum. If someone offends us two more inches, however, we will snap. Many wives are patient with their husbands in this way&mdash;two inches today, two more inches tomorrow, two more inches next week, and two more inches the following week. Their patience is stretched little by little until eventually the elastic band snaps. Then they start throwing things at their husbands. This is our patience. But the Lord Jesus&rsquo; patience is able to encircle the globe. His patience is infinite.</p>
<p>We will also come to realize that our love is too shallow and that His love is infinitely deep (v. 19). We cannot even tell how deep His love is. The more we love Him, the more we will discover that His love is infinite. The more we love Him, the more we will discover that His attributes are infinite. And the more we love Him, the more we will realize that His sympathy towards men is infinite. We will discover that the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe are the Lord Jesus. Just as these four dimensions of breadth, length, height, and depth are infinite, so our Lord Jesus is also infinite. He is infinitely wide, infinitely long, infinitely high, and infinitely deep. Christ is the dimensions of the universe.</p>
<p>Calling on the Lord will also cause us to be rooted and grounded in love and to taste the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ (vv. 17, 19). We will be submerged in the ocean of His love. His infinite love will completely inundate us, and we will be rooted and grounded in this love. At this juncture, we will be filled with all that God is and has. We experience all these things not through good behavior, self-cultivation, or self-improvement but by loving the Lord Jesus and allowing Him to completely possess us within so that our whole being is filled unto all the fullness of God. The last stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #501 matches this thought. The first two lines of this stanza say, &ldquo;Thy Spirit will me saturate, / Every part will God permeate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Christian life is not a matter of doing good, or of adjusting, cultivating, or improving ourselves. It is wholly a matter of being mingled with the Triune God as one. As the Spirit, God is strengthening us into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our heart. The result is that we are filled unto all the fullness of God. The Spirit strengthens us, Christ makes home in us, and God fills us. As a result, our whole being is possessed by the Triune God. We are filled with the Lord Jesus and with God&rsquo;s presence. This is glorious. This is the Christian life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD<br />
AND BEING SAVED</h2>
<p>All these things should not just be teachings among us. Dear brothers and sisters, each one of us should receive this light and jump into this flow. We should live according to the sense of the sweetness of the Lord Jesus that is hidden deep within us. Do we not feel that the Lord Jesus is sweet? If so, we should call on His name more and more. The Bible reveals this simple way. It says, &ldquo;The same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him; for &lsquo;whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rsquo;&rdquo; (Rom. 10:12b-13). If you would like to be saved, call on the name of the Lord. Do not say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I am already saved.&rdquo; Although you have been saved eternally, you still have not been saved from your temper, your self, your oldness, and from the world. You still need to be delivered from all these things. You need a further experience of salvation. Call on the name of the Lord, and you shall be saved. If you are willing to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I love You! Lord Jesus, You are so wonderful!&rdquo;, you will be saved.</p>
<p>How can we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s salvation? How can we allow the Lord to carry out His salvation in us? The way is to open ourselves to the Lord, and the way to open to the Lord is not to consider in the mind how to open to the Lord. The more we think about how to open, the more closed we become. Instead of thinking, we should forget our thoughts and exercise our spirit to call on the name of the Lord from deep within&mdash;&ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I love You. O Lord Jesus, I love You. I am willing to give myself to You just as You have given Yourself to me. Lord, I love You!&rdquo; By calling upon His name, our spirit will open to Him. Then He will carry out His salvation in us, and we will live with Him, in Him, and by Him. He will also saturate and permeate our entire being so that every part of our being becomes Him. This is the Christian life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">RECEIVING THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY<br />
OF THE SPIRIT TO GROW, TO BE TRANSFORMED, AND TO BE CONFORMED</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1-2; Eph. 4:22-24; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29; 11:17; Phil. 1:19; John 6:57</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION BEING<br />
A DELIVERANCE FROM WITHIN</h2>
<p>The most wonderful aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is that He works Himself into us. The Lord does not save us from the outside. He saves us by entering into us. Not only does He enter into us, but He also mingles Himself with our entire being. His salvation does not go from the outside to the inside but from the inside to the outside, not from the circumference to the center but from the center to the circumference.</p>
<p>We can testify of this from our experience. Often when we pray, we embrace the religious concept that salvation will come from the heavens outside of us. Therefore, we lift our head and look upward while praying and calling. However, our experience shows us that at other times when we pray in a more informal way and even when we do not seem to be praying at all, we experience salvation breaking out from within us. According to our concept, we think that salvation will come from above, but instead, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation comes to us from within. Why is this? The Lord&rsquo;s salvation comes from within us because on the day that we were saved, at the very moment that we repented, confessed, believed, and prayed to the Lord, the wonderful Lord entered into the center of our being, our spirit. We may have had no consciousness that this happened, and we may not have sensed anything, but because we believed in Him and prayed to Him, He entered into our spirit. This mysterious reality is altogether not based upon our feelings. Some may experience great joy, sweetness, and release when the Lord enters into them, but with most people this is not the case. With most people, the Lord enters into their spirit in a quiet way, even without their knowledge. We may not have sensed anything and may not have known that anything happened, but when we believed in Him, the Lord Jesus entered into us.</p>
<p>Allow me to give a few examples to prove this to you. There are some people who repented, confessed, believed, and prayed to the Lord. When they did all of these things, they expected that something would happen. Thus, when it appeared to them that nothing had happened, they were disappointed, concluding that the gospel is not real and that the preaching that they heard was not reliable. Although they came to this kind of conclusion, within a few days (with some it is three or four days, with others it may be seven or eight days) something rose up within them without their knowledge. Some may call it a power, some may say that it is salvation, and others may say that they have experienced a change, but regardless of what terminology is used to describe it, this experience is very real. Something powerful rises up from within them to save them.</p>
<p>Forty years ago I preached the gospel to a man named Mr. Du, and he got saved. Mr. Du liked to drink. He had been in Christianity for many years but had never repented or believed until he heard our gospel preaching. When he heard our gospel preaching, he repented, believed, and called upon the Lord. Thus, he was truly saved. Mr. Du had a good friend and neighbor named Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang also had been in Christianity for many years, but he still liked to play cards and go to the opera. He seldom went to Christian meetings. He would go maybe only once every three to six months. Some years he went only on December 25 to attend a Christmas service. Mr. Yang was about thirty years old, and he and Mr. Du were good friends who enjoyed drinking together. After Mr. Du believed in the Lord, Mr. Yang was influenced by him and also believed in the Lord. Mr. Yang genuinely believed in the Lord and was saved into the church. Now he was no longer merely a nominal Christian. Mr. Du and Mr. Yang were happy that both of them had believed in the Lord and had come into the church life. One day one of them laughed and said to the other, &ldquo;Let us have a little wine together.&rdquo; The other answered, &ldquo;No. It is not good to drink.&rdquo; But the first answered back, &ldquo;We can just drink a little &lsquo;Timothy wine.&rsquo; In 1 Timothy 5:23 Paul told Timothy, &lsquo;No longer drink water only, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.&rsquo; Thus, if it is all right for Timothy to drink a little wine, why can&rsquo;t we have some also?&rdquo; After this the two of them raised their glasses and began to drink. However, when Mr. Du took a sip of the wine, it did not taste right to him, so he looked at Mr. Yang, and after Mr. Yang took a sip, he said to Mr. Du, &ldquo;This wine has changed. It tastes bitter.&rdquo; The two of them each took another sip, and then without saying anything further, they both put down their glasses at the same time; neither of them could take another sip. This story demonstrates that even if you follow the letter of the Bible, the Christ who is within you may not agree with you. According to the Bible, it may be okay to have a little &ldquo;Timothy wine,&rdquo; but something within you may object. This illustrates that salvation does not come from outward teaching; salvation comes from within.</p>
<p>Let me give you another example. When I was preaching the gospel forty years ago, another person got saved. His last name was Jing. He worked at the customs office and was about the same age as Mr. Du. Mr. Jing was tall and strong. He came from Manchuria, had a good sense of humor, spoke with a loud voice, and liked to smoke and drink. His colleagues at the customs office often had parties. If Mr. Jing did not attend these parties, his colleagues did not have much fun, so they always made sure that he came. Mr. Jing was known for being kind and also for being a chain smoker&mdash;he smoked from the time that he arrived at the office until the time that he left. This was the kind of person that Mr. Jing was before he got saved. One day, however, he came to listen to the gospel. At that time we were holding a series of gospel meetings at the beginning of the new year. After listening to the gospel for a few nights, on the last evening Mr. Jing came to see me. He said, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, I understood your preaching, and I am also very touched by it. Now I would like to ask you, how can I get saved?&rdquo; I answered him, &ldquo;It is very simple. You have to repent, confess, believe, and pray. Go home and pray to the Lord Jesus. Tell Him, &lsquo;Lord Jesus, I am a sinner.&rsquo; After you pray this, whatever sin you sense within, just confess that sin, and after you confess, say, &lsquo;Lord Jesus! Thank You. You were crucified on the cross for me. I believe in You, and I receive You as my Savior.&rsquo;&rdquo; When he went home, he did what I had instructed him to do, but when he prayed in this way, it did not seem to him that anything had happened. The next morning he went to work as usual. It was his habit to bring two packs of cigarettes with him every day, but on this morning, for some unknown reason, he forgot to bring them. One of Mr. Jing&rsquo;s colleagues who sat across from him at the office was also a chain smoker. When the two of them would arrive at their desks each morning, they would look across at each other and give each other a certain look that seemed to say, &ldquo;I have my cigarettes, and I intend to smoke them. You better have brought your own, for I am not going to let you take advantage of me by asking me for my cigarettes.&rdquo; However, on this morning when his colleague took out his cigarettes, Mr. Jing realized that he had forgotten to bring his. At that moment he also remembered that the night before he had believed in Jesus, so he told his colleague, &ldquo;I have forgotten to bring my cigarettes, but last night I believed in Jesus.&rdquo; When his colleague heard this, he replied, &ldquo;Forget about it, my dear Jing. You are good at joking around. I know that you must be up to some new trick by saying that you have believed in Jesus. Do not think that you are going to be able to take advantage of me this morning. Whether or not you brought your cigarettes is your business. I am not going to give you any of mine.&rdquo; Then Mr. Jing&rsquo;s colleague waited to see what would happen. To his surprise the whole morning went by, and Mr. Jing did not smoke. Then the colleague observed Mr. Jing further. The whole afternoon went by, and still he did not smoke. Mr. Jing&rsquo;s colleague was now quite surprised. He knew that even if Mr. Jing were joking, there was no way that he could have maintained the joke for this long. This was the way in which Mr. Jing quit smoking.</p>
<p>That evening the employees of the customs office held a party as usual and invited Mr. Jing to come. It was difficult for him to refuse, so he went. When he got to the party, he simply remained quiet and just smiled at everyone. As a result, people began to make fun of him. But no matter what they said, he remained quiet and smiled at them. Eventually someone said, &ldquo;Everybody look. Dear Jing is up to something new today.&rdquo; Still, regardless of how others teased him, he remained quiet. Then he told his friends, &ldquo;I have believed in Jesus. I do not smoke anymore, I do not drink anymore, and I will not fool around anymore.&rdquo; When they heard this, everyone just laughed and said, &ldquo;Forget about it! Who are you fooling? You are up to some new trick!&rdquo; Then everyone came to give a toast for him, but instead of drinking with them, he simply said &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and smiled. Within him there was a power that enabled him to stop drinking. This is how Mr. Jing was changed.</p>
<p>When the employees of the customs office had parties, their wives always accompanied them. Once Mr. Jing had been saved, he stopped going out with his colleagues, and as a result, his wife also could not go out with them. Therefore, his wife became very angry with Jesus and blamed those who had preached Jesus to her husband. When Mr. Jing got saved, he became very burning for the Lord. One day he invited seven or eight of us to his home for a love feast and asked his wife to prepare a meal for us. Little did he know that his wife was very angry and had no intention of preparing anything. I was also invited to his home that day. When we arrived at his house, we saw that there was nothing on the table to eat but cold leftovers from the day before. Brother Jing sat down in tears, but we said to him, &ldquo;Brother, this is really a love feast. Let us eat!&rdquo; On another occasion when Brother Jing was at a meeting, his wife waited for him impatiently at home. The moment Brother Jing walked in the door, his wife began taking paintings off the wall and throwing them at him. Nevertheless, he still smiled and praised the Lord. He was able to respond in this way, not because he had received some power from without but because there was a power within him.</p>
<p>I can tell you many stories of preaching the gospel and seeing the Lord save people, not from without but from within. We may think that when the Lord saves us, He is like someone who is standing on solid ground pulling someone else out of a deep pit. This is not the Lord&rsquo;s way. When we open our mouth to pray, the Lord enters into us and pushes us out of the pit from within us. The Lord enters into us and saves us from within.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT<br />
BEING OUR BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY</h2>
<p>In reality the Lord&rsquo;s saving power is the Lord Himself. Today He is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. He has both the element of divinity and the element of humanity within Him. In addition, God&rsquo;s divine attributes, the human virtues, the elements of redemption, His all-terminating crucifixion, His all-inclusive death, His resurrection, His ascension, and righteousness, holiness, light, life, love, and victory are all in Him. Everything is in the Spirit. The composition of the Spirit is rich and bountiful. This is why we call Him the all-inclusive Spirit. Our Lord is such a Spirit.</p>
<p>When the all-inclusive Spirit enters into us, first He becomes our life, and second He becomes our life supply. These two steps involve a great deal. We can illustrate these two steps with the food that we eat. The Lord Jesus likened Himself to food in John 6:57. He said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.&rdquo; We all know that food is for our inward supply. A proper meal contains many vitamins and nutrients. After these nutrients have been digested by our stomach, they are absorbed and transported to the different parts of our body to become our many elements. The food that we eat is organic. Thus, by being metabolized into our body, it produces an organic change within us.</p>
<p>If a brother is very weak, his face will be pale and skinny. If this is the case, how can we help him? If we expend some effort to improve his outward appearance by rubbing some white powder or some red or black make-up on his face, this is not organic but artificial. This will not help him to become healthy. It may even damage him. What then is the proper thing to do for him? The proper thing to do is to have him drink the best drink and eat the most nutritious food. If he eats in this way for four consecutive weeks, his complexion will become fair, ruddy, and healthy. This is an illustration of inward organic transformation. This is metabolism.</p>
<p>Please forgive me for speaking about myself. I am one who ministers the word all year round. For every one hour that I speak, I must have three hours of sleep. I also have to eat well. In America even the young people who are in their twenties or thirties cannot catch up with an old man like me. I can speak for five to six hours straight, but this would totally exhaust them. You ask me what the secret is? It is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that I am able to eat, drink, and sleep. What I eat and drink becomes a supply to my body. In 1948 I went to Foochow and lived there for about two to three months. The schedule that the brothers arranged for me was very tight. There were at least three meetings a day&mdash;morning, afternoon, and evening. It was really tiring. However, Foochow produces a certain kind of mandarin orange. After every message that I gave, they would give me a glass of mandarin orange juice. Two minutes after I drank the juice, I would be energized again. I was energized because I had received an inward supply.</p>
<p>Today the Lord Jesus is the all-inclusive Spirit of life. The ingredients in Him are much richer than any food or drink. Whatever we need is in Him. He is truly a bountiful supply. His supply comes into us not only to give us power but also to work His elements; into us so that we can be transformed metabolically. Change is outward, but transformation is inward. Your goal may be to receive power, but His goal is not to merely give you power but to transform you.</p>
<p>Suppose I have a plain cup of water. Now suppose that I add a little bit of lemon, tea, and honey to it. If I do this, I will now have a cup of lemon tea, containing the ingredients of water, honey, lemon, and tea. When these ingredients are mixed together, they have an organic, nutritional capability of supplying you with energy. The Lord enters into us with all His elements; however, His goal is not just to supply you with power. His goal is to work His elements, His essence, into you for you to be organically transformed within.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT MERELY DISCUSSING NUTRITION BUT<br />
LEARNING TO COOK AND TO EAT</h2>
<p>We cannot obtain the Lord&rsquo;s elements just by listening to messages, because messages, even when repeated over and over again, can only give us a kind of knowledge, understanding, and comprehension. They cannot give us the Lord&rsquo;s essence, the Lord&rsquo;s elements.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a brother catches a serious cold, and after being sick for six weeks he is pale and thin. Suppose I wish to help him, but I know only how to talk and do not know how to do anything else. I only know how to tell him about nutrition, but I do not know how to cook for him. From morning to evening I just lecture him from a book on nutrition, telling him that he is missing this and that, and that he should do this and that. I tell him all that is relevant regarding nutrition. If I did this, would it do him any good? Actually, he probably would be better off if I did not speak to him so much. The more I speak, the skinnier he becomes. He receives a lot of knowledge, but it is all useless to him. Now suppose his mother comes to see him. She loves him very much, and without saying a word to him, she just cooks three good meals for him each day. The result of eating these meals will be that he will become healthy.</p>
<p>What is the problem with Christianity today? The problem is that Christianity has nutritional talk without actual cooking. I include myself in this. I am afraid that I may be just speaking on nutrition and not cooking for you to eat. I am afraid that many who have come from different localities to listen will say, &ldquo;Brother Lee is still giving the same messages as he gave before. He is still talking about calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading the Lord&rsquo;s word. We have heard all of this before.&rdquo; Dear brothers and sisters, I am not asking if you have heard this before. I am asking you whether or not you have eaten. I am not here to give you make-up lessons. I am here to nourish you. Messages will do you little good; only the Spirit is profitable. The Spirit is the Lord Himself, the Spirit is food, the Spirit is life, and the Spirit is the life supply. The supply of the Spirit is a bountiful supply that meets every need.</p>
 <p>It is difficult for us to make a turn and to enter into this point. From birth we have been in our naturalness, and as we grew up, we got into culture; after we believed, we entered into religion. These three things&mdash;naturalness, culture, and religion&mdash;are wrapped around us. They have become three layers of veils. We do not have just one layer; we have three layers of veils. One is our naturalness, another is human culture, and still another is religion. I am afraid that even after hearing a thousand or even ten thousand messages, you will still have your religious concept.</p>
<p>The Spirit is missing in religion. A religion is a set of beliefs with corresponding teachings. Religion always teaches us to do this and to do that. Religion is full of teachings. However, religion never supplies us. We may think the church is the same. We may think that the church is nothing more than speaking the word and listening to the word. This concept is wrong. Hence, within me there is a heavy burden. I have been before the Lord, looking to Him from deep within. I have prayed, &ldquo;Lord, open the understanding of the saints in the churches in every locality so that they can see that what they need today is not just the word but also the Spirit.&rdquo; Today we need not only the word; we need the Spirit also. The word teaches you; the Spirit supplies you.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SUPPLY BRINGING IN TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s goal is not merely to supply us; God&rsquo;s goal is to transform us. My burden in this message is on transformation. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, transform us!&rdquo; The religious concept is that if a person has a quick temper, he needs to be taught so that he can make a change. Religion tells him, &ldquo;You are a quick-tempered person. You do everything hurriedly. Thus, you must understand that you need to make a change.&rdquo; However, the Lord is not like this. The Lord wants you to eat a little bit of Him every day and receive a little bit of Him into you every day. He is Spirit, and as the Spirit He can be received into you. He has no intention to change your quick disposition, but when He enters into you&mdash;a little bit today, a little bit tomorrow, and a little bit the following day&mdash;His essence, which is the Spirit, enters into every part of your being, including your natural disposition. As a result, your being is spontaneously changed. He does not deliberately change you from being a quick person to being a slow person, or change you from being a slow person to being a quick person. This is not the way He works. Instead, He transforms your being, your essence. Romans 12:2 says that we are being transformed by the renewing of the mind, and 2 Corinthians 3:18 says that we are being transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image. The Lord&rsquo;s way is to transform us into His image by supplying us with Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WILD OLIVE TREE<br />
BEING GRAFTED INTO THE TRUE OLIVE TREE</h2>
<p>Romans 11 says that we, the Gentiles, are a wild olive tree. By believing in the Lord we are grafted into the true olive tree and are able to partake of the fatness of the root of the olive tree. Within the root of the true olive tree is the sap, the life-juice, which is the fatness. When the wild olive branch is grafted into the true olive tree, the life-sap enters the branch, and the branch receives the supply. I believe that as a Christian, you have this kind of experience&mdash;the experience of being a wild olive branch who has been grafted into the true olive tree and who receives the life-sap of the true olive tree to supply your whole being. If you do have this experience, then I exhort you to forget outward teachings and to pay attention to the inward supply of the sap.</p>
<p>The supply of the life-sap is not only to give you power but also to transform you. How does transformation take place? The nature and essence of a branch from a wild olive tree are that of a wild olive tree. However, once this branch is grafted into a true olive tree, the sap from the true olive tree supplies this wild olive branch and transforms it. Eventually, olives come forth. In the past the olives from the wild olive branch tasted bitter and sour, but now that the sap of the true olive has passed through the wild olive branch, the essence of the wild olive branch has been transformed, and the olives are now sweet and fragrant. Even the shape of the olives from this wild olive branch will now be just like that of the true olive tree.</p>
<p>The process of bearing olives is a process from glory to glory and from day to day. Last week the olive was still tiny. After two weeks it is bigger. And after yet another two weeks it is even bigger. In the initial stage there was not that much glory, but in the end after it has matured, you will see an olive that is full of glory. In the process it went from glory to glory. The expression <em>from glory to glory</em> in 2 Corinthians 3:18 means &ldquo;from one degree of glory to another degree of glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our desire is that in this age we would see churches being raised up from locality to locality and that these churches would not put their emphasis on teaching but on opening up the believers&rsquo; eyes to give them a vision. In these churches light would shine, enabling the believers to see that what they need is not outward teaching but the inward life supply. They would also see that when they believed and were saved, the source of life&mdash;the all-inclusive Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;came into them. They would learn to live in this all-inclusive Spirit, enjoy this Spirit, and receive His bountiful supply daily. In this way day by day the supply would change the essence of their being. Month by month and year by year in every local church, we would see brothers and sisters who regularly come to the meetings and are being transformed day by day. They are just like the wild olive branches that were grafted into the true olive tree. When a branch is first grafted in, you cannot see much happening. The branch is just there absorbing the fatness from the true olive tree and inwardly receiving the supply. Gradually you will see a new sprout, then a few flower blossoms, and finally a little fruit will come out. When you look again after two weeks, the fruit will have grown a little bigger. After yet another two weeks there will be more growth, and in the end the fruit will be matured, and there will be sweet and fragrant olives. I hope that all the local churches will be like this, so that year after year the brothers and sisters will receive Christ, enjoy His riches, obtain His bountiful supply, and be transformed in essence. Transformation is not a sudden change in outward appearance; it is a slow change in inward essence. By being transformed in this way, the brothers and sisters will eventually be altogether different from what they were before they were saved. Transformation is not sudden; it is a continuous metabolic process in life which eventually produces manifest results.</p><h2 class="head1">GROWING INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S IMAGE<br />
THROUGH TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>This is the church that the Lord wants today. The church that the Lord wants is not just a church with saints who are standing on the ground of oneness. The church that the Lord wants is a church in which the saints are standing on the ground of oneness and also eating Christ, enjoying Christ, absorbing His rich supply, and receiving His bountiful supply. This bountiful supply first enters into their spirit, then into their mind, emotion, will and every part of their being, transforming their very essence. What we believe in is not a doctrine but a living Spirit. I am not just preaching messages of doctrines. I am preaching a living Christ. After speaking to you for an hour, I do not care if you do not understand what I am saying. What I do care about is that your spirit has touched Christ. I do not expect you to remember everything you have heard. My only hope is that your inner being has been touched by Christ. Once your inner being has been touched by Christ, your spiritual understanding will increase, and when you go home, you will be able to contact the Lord yourself. You will also fellowship with Him a little, pray to Him a little more, and spend more time with Him so that your inner being will get the supply. Then little by little His essence will enter into your essence and transform your essence. This transformation is not the result of a change in behavior but of organic metabolism. Transformation goes together with growth. Actually, transformation is growth. The result of transformation is conformation. When we are transformed, we will be conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. At this juncture God&rsquo;s original intention in creating man will be achieved. When God first created man, He created man in His image so that man would express Him. Eventually, those who are redeemed by God will not only have His image but also His life and His essence. His essence will be mingled with us, causing our entire being to undergo a metabolic transformation. Moreover, after we have been transformed continuously, we will grow into His image.</p>
<p>Every living thing has a definite life, and every life has definite characteristics, a definite power, and a definite shape. The seed of a henna flower, for example, has a life and a power with a particular shape. All you have to do is to plant this seed into the ground and allow it to grow. The seed not only has the power to grow, but after a period of growth, it has the power to form that seed into the shape of a henna flower. A flower is different from a factory-made plastic product. Something made in a factory must be pressed into shaped by an outward mold. The shape of a henna flower, however, does not come from a mold. The shape of a henna flower comes through growth. The shape of a chrysanthemum also comes through growth. This is true for plants as well as for animals. When a puppy or a kitten is first born, it may not be easy to distinguish whether it is a dog or a cat. However, there is no need to worry. You simply need to allow the puppy or the kitten to grow, and while the puppy or the kitten is growing, you need not find a carpenter to make a mold to put on its body. If you just allow the puppy or the kitten to grow, eventually, it will grow into the shape of a dog or a cat. No matter how a puppy grows, it will never grow two horns like a cow, and no matter how a kitten grows, it will not grow into the shape, image, of a horse. This is because the life within each one of them has a definite shape.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s image is in God&rsquo;s life. The image of the Lord Jesus is in His life. Thus, if you just let the life of the Lord Jesus grow within you, His life will produce an image. After a period of growth, His image will be manifested through you. Therefore, you may call this process growth, transformation, or conformation. We were all created, and we have all been redeemed and regenerated. Thank and praise the Lord for this. Now we are in the process of enjoying His bountiful supply and receiving His rich essence. His supply and His essence cause our natural element to have a metabolic transformation. This organic transformation causes us to grow, to be transformed, and to be conformed. No doctrine can accomplish this; only the Spirit can. Hallelujah that He is the Spirit and that He is in us as our bountiful supply.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, from deep within I hope that every one of you would put aside the messages that you have heard for so many years. It does not matter whether or not you remember those messages. What you and I have to see today is that the all-inclusive Spirit with His bountiful supply is within us. This supply is an organic supply, a supply that is able to transform us. As long as you enjoy Him continuously, allowing Him to add Himself into you more and more, then spontaneously you will grow, you will be transformed, and you will be conformed into His image. May the Lord have mercy on us. We all should pray for this, and look to the Lord for this.</p></body></html>
