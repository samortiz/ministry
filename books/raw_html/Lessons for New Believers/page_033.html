 <h1 class="msg">LESSON NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO MEET</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>In the previous lesson we covered the importance of meeting, the benefit of meeting, and the result of not meeting. In this lesson we will consider how to meet.</p>
<p>Although meeting is a spiritual matter, there is still the need of teaching and leading. Many matters related to life require teaching. Teaching, however, is futile if there is no life. But life without teaching and training will be useless. For example, in order for us to speak a human language, we need the human life. However, we will still be unable to speak any language without learning and practice. This principle applies to meeting. A person who is not saved cannot meet because he does not have the life of God. Believers have the life of God; this life requires us to meet and gives us the ability to meet. However, we still need to learn many techniques related to how to meet in order to be skillful in our meeting. Therefore, it is necessary that we be taught.</p>
<p>When we consider the condition of our meetings, we realize that thirty years ago we were like children playing. Although the Lord&rsquo;s mercy was upon us in our childishness and brought us through, we wasted some of our time and energy. After many years we can now say that we have discovered some ways and secrets concerning how to meet. In order to meet we must have a seeking heart and a strong spirit. We also need the presence of the Holy Spirit by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and blessing. These are crucial matters. In addition, we need to carefully consider the techniques of meeting, which are definitely related to ushering in spiritual blessing. We must pay attention to all these matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF MEETING</h2>
<p>What is the purpose of meeting? What is its significance? The general concept concerning Christian gatherings is that church members sit in a chapel, listen to the preaching of a pastor, and sing some hymns. After this the pastor will stretch out his hands to give a benediction, and everyone goes home. This is the concept most people have concerning Christian meetings. But we are not speaking of this kind of meeting. Our meeting is by no means a so-called Sunday service. There are four aspects to the purpose of our meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Toward God&mdash;Worship</h2>
<p>The first aspect of the purpose of meeting is toward God. This can be summarized as worship. Worshipping God involves four points.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Singing</h3>
<p>We need to sing hymns in the meeting. Once a person is saved, he needs to learn to sing hymns. Some may have learned music in school and, therefore, have some knowledge concerning singing; this is convenient. But even with this knowledge concerning singing, we still need to adjust our attitude when we sing. Whereas we learned to appreciate music artistically, now we should sing hymns with a heart to praise. The brothers and sisters who have not learned music need to learn a little concerning music. Hence, sometimes it is necessary to teach the brothers and sisters before or after the meetings how to sing hymns.</p>
<p>Singing hymns is closely related to meeting. If the singing is poor, our spirit often cannot be uplifted. If the singing is good, our spirit will be easily uplifted. Sometimes a hymn is begun in a key that is too high for people to follow; at other times the key is so low that it is difficult for people to breathe. Sometimes the singing is so fast that it is difficult for people to keep up; at other times it is so slow that it puts people to sleep. This requires our attention and learning.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Praising</h2>
<p>We need to praise God in the meetings. We praise God with prayers, not with hymns. Good praises are often needed in the meeting. This is not petitioning, asking, begging, or even thanking. This is praising God mainly for His doings and His virtues. We should read the words of praise in the Bible and apply them frequently in the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Thanking</h2>
<p>In the meeting we also need to give thanks to God for His grace and for the works of grace He accomplished for us. Whereas the objects of our praise are God&rsquo;s doings and His virtues, the objects of our thanksgiving are God&rsquo;s grace and His works of grace.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Meditating</h2>
<p>We also need quiet moments to meditate during the meetings. In particular this applies to the bread-breaking meeting; the brothers and sisters should exercise to be calm and consider the Lord Himself. Even the prayer meeting needs this.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters should always consider the Lord quietly before a meeting begins. We should not talk and disturb the spirit of worship. This requires much exercise. We need a kind of contemplation to consider the Lord and His doings.</p>
<p>These four points constitute our worship to God. In the meetings we should sing hymns to God, offer prayers of praise to God for His doing and His virtues, and thank Him for His grace and works of grace. We also need to be calm before God to consider His person and His doings.</p>
