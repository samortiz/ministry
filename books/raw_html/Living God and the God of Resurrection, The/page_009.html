        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE JUDGING GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 12:23, 26-29; 1 Pet. 4:17; Rev. 19:11-12; 2 Tim. 4:1; Matt. 25:19; 1 Cor. 4:4-5; Rom. 14:10, 12; 2 Cor. 5:10-11; 1 Cor. 11:31-32; John 16:8; Isa. 57:14-15; Psa. 51:17</h1>
<p>The Bible uses various words to describe God. These various words indicate His characteristics, His attributes. A believer&rsquo;s condition often depends on his knowledge of God, which is derived from the Word of God. Many passages in the Bible reveal God to us so that we may know Him and His works. These portions focus on the kind of God we have. Hence, in order for us to know God, we must understand the Bible and pay particular attention to the words that describe God. Through these words the Bible reveals various aspects of God&rsquo;s character.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CREATING GOD AND THE JUDGING GOD</h2>
<p>The progression of the revelation of God in the Bible is very significant. First, the Bible presents the creating God (Gen. 1:1) and then the redeeming God (3:21). In addition, the Bible says that He is the living God (2 Sam. 22:47), the righteous God (Psa. 7:9), and the God of lovingkindness (Neh. 9:32). He is light (1 John 1:5), He is power (2 Cor. 13:4), and He is the God who hides Himself (Isa. 45:15). He is the God of resurrection (2 Cor. 1:9). He is also the God of grace (Heb. 4:16), and He gives His rich grace to man by giving man all that He is, all that He has, and all that He has done. He also gives man His fullness, His life, and His might. The Bible further reveals that He is a judging God (Rev. 19:11; 2 Tim. 4:1). The beginning of the Bible speaks of creation, showing that God is the creating God, and the end of the Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s judgment, showing that He is a judging God.</p>
<p>The <em>creating God</em> speaks not only of the work of creation but also that God is a person who creates. He is the creating God not only at the beginning of time; He has not ceased His work of creation. Sometimes He creates a new environment for us, and at other times He creates a new mood. Everything about us was created by God for us. This shows that our God is a creating God.</p>
<p>The Bible also says that God is a judging God. This does not mean He is waiting until the end of the age in order to execute His judgment. He has been the judging God since the first fall of man. In Genesis 3 God judged the serpent for seducing man, and He judged Adam and Eve for acting contrary to His command. In chapter 4 God judged Cain for rejecting His salvation. Chapter 5 shows that under God&rsquo;s judgment, the destiny of fallen man is death. In chapter 6 the wickedness of man was so great in the earth that his iniquities reached the heavens; hence, God came to judge man. Except for Noah and his family, God judged all mankind with the flood (chs. 7&mdash;8). In chapter 11 the descendants of Noah rebelled at Babel, and God judged them by confounding their language and scattering them over the surface of the earth. In the rest of the Old Testament God judges His elect, Israel, in the wilderness and in Canaan and also in their desolation, captivity, return, and restoration. When God walks among His people, He blesses and keeps them and also judges them. Even the Gentile nations are judged by God (Dan. 5). He is a judging God. Hence, in Romans 3:19 the apostle Paul says that all the world, including Jews and Gentiles, is under the judgment of God.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, the church age, the Bible further reveals that whenever something goes wrong in the church, God comes in to judge, such as in the case of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11). In the beginning of Acts the church was blessed, but this couple had crooked hearts, deceived the Holy Spirit, and were immediately judged by God. God continues to judge the church. When the church became desolate, the apostles wrote the Epistles with a judging tone. For instance, Hebrews 12 says that we have come forward to God, the Judge of all (vv. 22-23), that God is a consuming fire (v. 29), and that He will shake not only the earth but also heaven (v. 26). God&rsquo;s shaking is His judging. Anything that is incompatible with His nature will not last and will be shaken, destroyed by fire. Only that which is of God is compatible with His nature and will not be shaken but will remain.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s appearance in Revelation is frightful. He has eyes like a flame of fire, His feet are like shining bronze, His voice is like the sound of many waters, and out of His mouth proceeds a sharp two-edged sword (1:14-16). His eyes &ldquo;bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:5; Luke 2:35). On the day of judgment no one will be able to escape His observing and judging. Hence, in Revelation He appears mainly as the judging God. Today He is the Word of God, He is our Savior, and He is sitting on the throne of grace. But at the end of the age He will be the judging God sitting on the throne of judgment (4:2; 6:16). &ldquo;Each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God&rdquo; (Rom. 14:12).</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
