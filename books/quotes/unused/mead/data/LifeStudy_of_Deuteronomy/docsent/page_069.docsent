   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message on the rehearsing of the general statutes and judgments, we will begin to consider the matter of the divine government among the children of Israel 16:18-20; 17:8-20; 19:15-21; 21:1-9, 18-23; 22:13-30; 24:1-4, 7, 16; 25:1-3, 5-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The portions of Deuteronomy which deal with the divine government are the word of God, not merely the word of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to study all these portions in order to know God's mind and to know what He is thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God knows man and man's need, condition, and situation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, whatever God speaks regarding man is the final word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>D. Concerning the Government among the People</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine government among God's people is neither autocracy nor democracy but theocracy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Theocracy is government by God according to what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church life today, we exercise neither autocracy, which is a kind of dictatorship, nor democracy, which is according to the opinion of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, we honor God's authority as our government, and thus the government in the church is a theocracy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Appointing of Judges and Officers</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Deuteronomy 16:18-20 speaks of the appointing of officers and judges.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>a. In All the Cities according to the Tribes</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There were to be judges and officers in every city.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To Keep Justice</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As verse 19 indicates, the appointed judges and officers were to keep God's justice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"You shall not distort justice; you shall not respect persons, nor shall you take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we see that the divine government firstly pays attention to justice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Any government that does not practice justice will not last.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A strong government is one that is established upon justice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In such a government everything is fair, just, and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To Pursue Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The judges and officers were required to pursue righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Righteousness, and only righteousness, shall you pursue, in order that you may live and possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you" v. 20 . To keep justice is to pursue righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By pursuing righteousness the children of Israel would be able to live long on the land God had given them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without keeping justice and pursuing righteousness, they could not have lived longer in the good land.</S>
