                 PARSING CODES FOR VERB-RELATED FORMS

       Derived from Perschbacher's "New Analytical Greek Lexicon"
           and abbreviated in a form similar to that found in
              Friberg's "Analytical Greek New Testament"

                         Maurice A. Robinson
                             1 July 1995

  The codes which follow reflect an original abridgment and correction
  of the parsing codes utilized in Wesley J. Perschbacher, _The New
  Analytical Greek Lexicon_ (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1990), which
  volume is itself an updated and corrected revision of the original
  _Analytical Greek Lexicon_ by Samuel Davidson (London: Samuel Bagster
  and Sons, 1859).

  The abbreviation system herein utilized, although developed
  independently, retains features similar to those found in Timothy and
  Barbara Friberg _The Analytical Greek New Testament_ (Grand Rapids:
  Baker, 1981), and can be used with ease by anyone familiar with with
  either the Davidson, Perschbacher, or Friberg volumes.

  Many non-verbal New Testament Greek forms (e.g., nouns, adjectives,
  conjunctions, prepositions, and particles) can be declined in more
  than one manner.  Following the example of Davidson and Perschbacher,
  the declensions given reflect only those forms which actually occur
  in the Greek New Testament.

  The present verbal codes exhaustively cover every possible verb
  parsing situation cited by Perschbacher, and reflect the totality of
  forms used in the Online Bible Greek module for verb parsings.

  The present parsing list makes no claim to errorlessness; should the
  user discover any errors in either the parsing/declension codes or
  Strong's numbers while using the Online Bible, please inform the
  present editor c/o SEBTS, P.O.  Box 1889, Wake Forest, NC 27588.



  All Greek verbs are listed in one of three various forms:

       1) V-tense-voice-mood
       2) V-tense-voice-mood-person-number

  SEARCHING FOR WORDS USING THE PARSING CODES:

      All parsing and declension code information for the Online Bible 
      Greek text is supplied in CAPITAL letters whereas the Greek text
      appears entirely in lower case letters.  The Online Bible search 
      routine allows case-sensitive searching, so that one can easily 
      use lower case to search for Greek words only (with or without 
      wildcards), and upper case to search by parsing or declension 
      only (also with or without wildcards).  Using Boolean search 
      captabilities, one can combine lower and upper case search 
      requests to select specific Greek forms in association with 
      specified parsing or declension information.

      Note that in order to search across hyphenated sections of the
      parsing (e.g., for V-PAI-3S), one must make a "phrase search"
      request, since the Online Bible disregards hyphens in its search
      routine.  Thus, to search for V-PAI-3S, the request must be 
      specific for either the phrase "V PAI 3S" or "V-PAI-3S".

      Note that, even though one could search for all the forms of
      "legw" by "leg* | eleg*", or for all Present Active Indicative
      forms by "PAI", in order to link a word directly with its own
      particular parsing, a fully inclusive PHRASE SEARCH must be
      requested which indicates the preliminary part-of-speech 
      identifier (V-, N-, or A-) when appropriate.  E.g., to search for 
      all the Present Active Indicative forms of "legw" one would have 
      to request a phrase search for search for "leg* V-PAI".

      Note that the Strong's numbers may also be judiciously utilized
      when making search requests to reduce the amount of time and 
      space needed to otherwise frame such a request.  E.g., one 
      equally could do a phrase search for all Present Indicative 
      Active forms of "legw" by "3004 V-PAI"

      To search for phrases based solely on grammatical analysis (e.g.,
      for all prepositional phrases followed by an articular neuter
      genitive noun), one must use the wildcard (*) symbol before each
      requested parsing in a phrase search request (e.g., "* PREP *
      T-GSN * N-GSN").

      Special note: the so called "Second" forms of the Aorist, Future,
      Perfect and Pluperfect are respectively designated as 2A, 2F, 2P
      and 2L preceding the voice and mood designations.  Functionally,
      however, these forms are equivalent to the otherwise undesignated
      (First) Aorist, Future, Perfect, and Pluperfect forms.

      Search requests which expect to take in BOTH the first and second
      forms of either the Aorist, Future, Perfect or Pluperfect tenses
      MUST be prefixed with an asterisk (*).  Failure to use the
      wildcard prefix will result in the second tense forms NOT being 
      found.

      Example: to search for all Perfect Active Indicative forms (i.e.,
      both RAI and 2RAI), the wildcard form *RAI should be used.
      Similarly, to search for all Aorist Active Subjunctive forms,
      (i.e., AAS and 2AAS), the wildcard form *AAS should be used.


  STRONG'S NUMBERS:

      For access to the lexical definitions of the root form of each
      Greek word, the appropriate Strong's concordance number has been
      added immediately following each Greek word. The definition of
      that word can then be ascertained by following the normal Online
      Bible F4 key or definition function as found in English-language
      based texts.

      The user should be cautioned, however, that the Strong's numbers 
      utilized for the Greek New Testament are NOT always identical 
      with those used in coding the English version text.  The reason
      for this discrepancy is simple:  James Strong was attempting to
      help out the lay reader of the Authorized Version in assigning
      numbers to each unique word root form.  For some reason, he then
      decided that the user might be additionally aided if certain
      words (e.g., the verb "to be", or comparative and superlative
      forms of adjectives and adverbs) were further subdivided into
      uniquely-numbered forms; or, conversely, if frequent expressions
      comprising more than one word (e.g.  "ou mh") were subsumed under
      a single number, rather than giving the usual separate numbers to
      such forms.

      Thus, the Strong's apparatus -- well-suited as it may be for use 
      of the concordance he produced, as well as to aid the English
      reader who does not know Greek -- is quite confusing and
      detrimental to the student who might seek to use the same numbers
      for understanding the root forms of the Greek New Testament.

      In order to eliminate the various problems which would otherwise 
      arise from an incautious use of Strong's numbers as originally 
      provided for the English Bible, the present Greek edition of the 
      Online Bible has reduced the Strong's numbers considerably so as 
      to guide the user directly to the root form of most Greek words,
      without adding in the extra step of having further to enquire via
      the lexicon as to the component or root forms of such words.

      This revision of the Strong's numbers for the Greek text of the New
      Testament is not yet complete.  Future editions of the Online
      Bible Greek text will eventually bring all Strong's numbers into
      conformity with the principle of providing only the base root form
      for all Greek New Testament words.  The user's patience is
      requested during this period of development.


     ADDITIONAL NOTE REGARDING THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE VERB "TO BE"

  Strong's Concordance at times gives separate numbers to various forms
  of the verb "to be".  All of these properly derive from "eimi" (1510)
  alone.  Perschbacher gives both numbers: the separate Strong's number
  in the left margin and the root number in the right margin.  For the
  present time the Online Bible has retained Strong's number in these
  cases, even though Strong's own lexicon entry indicates the proper
  derivation from the root form 1510.

  Since accents and breathings are not provided within the Online Bible 
  Greek text, some forms will appear identical even though they possess
  different parsings or declensions.  Within the forms of the verb "to
  be" the following cases specifically should be noted:

     The verb form "h" (3s-pxs of 1510, numbered 2229 by Strong) occurs 
     infrequently, while the definite article, relative pronoun, and
     disjunctive particle forms of "h" dominate within the Greek NT.

     The verb form "ei" (2s-pxi of 1510) also occurs (in the absence of 
     accents and breathings) as a conditional particle, in fact, most
     frequently so.

     The verb form "hn" (3s-ixi of 1510) occurs also as a relative 
     pronoun.  However, the verb form is dominant within the Greek NT.

     The verb form "wsin" is not from 5607 (participle), but is a 
     subjunctive of (1510).  Note also that "wsin" may be a pluarl noun
     form of 3775.

     Of particular note: the verb form "hv" stems from 1510 if it is a 
     present subjunctive, but from 2229 if it is an imperfect
     indicative.
