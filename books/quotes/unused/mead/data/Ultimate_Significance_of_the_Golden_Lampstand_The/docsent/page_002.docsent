   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE SIGNIFICANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND Scripture Reading: Exo 25:31-32, 36-37; Zech 4:2, 10b; Rev 1:12-13, 20; 4:5b; 5:6; 1:4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this book, we will specifically consider the golden lampstand in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apparently, the Gospel, the Epistles, and the Revelation written by John are unrelated to the book of Exodus in the Old Testament; or we may say that it is difficult to find the relationship between them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is as if the former were wearing Western attire and the latter Chinese gowns, so that no one can see the relationship between them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, I want to make it clear that in substance John s writings are the development of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JOHN S WRITINGS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AND THE BOOK OF EXODUS The Lamb and the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are several important items in the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first item is the passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of Exodus is called Exodus because the passover lamb enabled the children of Israel to go out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second item is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the children of Israel kept the passover, left Egypt, and reached the wilderness, God wanted them to build a tabernacle for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, when we come to the end of Exodus in chapter forty, we see a tabernacle erected and filled with the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, we see that the first main item in Exodus is the lamb, and the last main item is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now I would like to ask, in John s Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation, what are the first and last main items?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In John s writings there are two beholds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In John 1 there is one behold : Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! v. 29 , and in Revelation 21 there is another behold : Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men v. 3 . In Exodus there are the lamb and the tabernacle, and the lamb is for the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, in John s writings there are the Lamb and the tabernacle, and the Lamb is also for the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Holy Anointing Oil</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Between the lamb and the tabernacle there are several other items, one of which is the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This holy anointing oil is found in Exodus and also in John s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The anointing which John spoke of was not invented by him; rather, he took it from Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, if we read only John s Epistles, we may know about the holy anointing oil itself but not its ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we want to know its ingredients, we have to go back to Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There we find that one of its ingredients is a hin of olive oil; this is the base.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Added to this hin of olive oil are four kinds of spices: five hundred shekels of myrrh, two hundred fifty shekels of fragrant cinnamon and two hundred fifty shekels of calamus, and five hundred shekels of cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The two units of two hundred fifty shekels form one combined unit of five hundred shekels.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are the constituents of the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Four kinds of spices were added to, compounded into, the olive oil as the base.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, the oil is no longer merely oil but has become an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, the measurements of the ingredients signify the Triune God, of whom the second was split.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The number five signifies God the Creator with man the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second unit being split implies Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, calamus, which grows in a marsh or muddy place, signifies resurrection, and the fragrance of cassia has the power to repel poisonous insects.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we add all these items together, we can see the elements and the functions of the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Need to Study the Old Testament Classics</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From the foregoing points, we can see that it is not enough for us to have only the New Testament; we also need the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the New Testament we can see the holy anointing oil, the anointing, but we cannot find its ingredients and its functions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To find its ingredients and functions we have to go to the classics to find the original picture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where are the classics ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One of the classics is Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The entire book of Exodus is a classical book.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What does Behold, the Lamb of God! mean?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We find the answer in the classics.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After some searching, we find in Exodus 12 that every house had to prepare a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In addition, Revelation 21:3 says, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Again, we need to go back to the classics.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Exodus we can see how the tabernacle was built, what kind of materials were used, and what kind of a situation was there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To find these matters, we must go back to the classics.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we all need to study the classical books.</S>
