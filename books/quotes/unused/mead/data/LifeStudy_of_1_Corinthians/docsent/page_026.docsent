   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This crucified Christ is also God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to accomplish anything, we need both power and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have pointed out that wisdom is for planning and purposing, whereas power is for carrying out and accomplishing what is planned and purposed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In God s economy Christ crucified is both God s power and His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is possible for us to have power or strength without having wisdom or the way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have power without wisdom, we may use our strength in a foolish way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we need Christ as both power and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The crucified Christ as God s power and wisdom can be applied to the problem we face with our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without exception, we all are bothered by our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who can say that he has never lost his temper?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After experiencing a certain amount of growth in life, we come to hate our temper and long to be free from it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I know of some sisters who, shortly before the day of their wedding, made a vow that they would never again lose their temper, especially never lose it with their husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, in every case this vow was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only in married life but in all kinds of situations in our daily life, we are troubled by our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christians who love the Lord and seek Him have prayed something like this: Lord Jesus, You know how easy it is for me to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, You are Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I ask You to save me from this sin of losing my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>O Lord, deliver me from this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although many have prayed in this way, none have been delivered from their temper as a result.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In ourselves we simply do not have either the power to overcome our temper or the wisdom, the way, to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may think that prayer will give us power and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, even when we pray, we still do not have power and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when we call on the name of the Lord, enjoy Christ, and are filled with the life-giving Spirit, we have no problem with our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Spontaneously we have both the power to overcome our temper and the way to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is this power and this way?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only the crucified Christ is the power and the wisdom to deal with our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may also apply the crucified Christ as God s power and wisdom to our need for patience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all desire to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But I have never met a person who is truly patient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We value patience and we desire to be patient, but we cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when we experience the crucified Christ, we automatically have patience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This crucified Christ becomes to us both the power and the wisdom for patience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, we have both the strength and the way to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, we do not try to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We simply are patient through our experience of Christ crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The crucified Christ can be applied to all manner of human experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For more than forty years, we have been preaching nothing other than Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Within this crucified Christ there are the elements Of resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, when we enjoy the crucified Christ, we also enjoy His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The key to experiencing the resurrection and ascension of Christ is found in Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Crucifixion is the threshold into all the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The cross is the way to experience Christ with all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Apart from Christ s crucifixion, there is no gateway for us to enter into the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Ephesians 1:9 speaks of God s good pleasure which He purposed in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Ephesians 3:11 Paul refers to the purpose of the ages which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, in Ephesians 1:11 Paul says that God operates all things according to the counsel of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The crucified Christ as God s wisdom is related to God s plan according to His good pleasure and also according to God s way to fulfill His will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s plan according to His good pleasure and His way to fulfill His will are deep and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, these profound matters can be applied to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have seen that when we experience the crucified Christ, He becomes to us both the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since we have the crucified Christ as God s wisdom, there is no need for us to seek a way to carry out God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Simply by experiencing the crucified Christ, we spontaneously have a way to do God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We become very wise in doing the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No longer is it necessary for us to make up our mind to do God s will or to determine to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Doing God s will does not even depend on our praying, Lord, Your will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christians everywhere pray for the will of God to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is common in Christian services for believers to pray, Lord, not our will, but Your will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But no matter how many times believers pray for the will of God to be done, the will of God is not accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you want to do the will of God, there is no need for you to pray the words, Your will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As long as you experience the crucified Christ, Christ will become to you God s wisdom to fulfill His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You will have the wisdom of God to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Perhaps you may not understand this at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But if you look backward after a period of months or years, you will realize that you did have God s wisdom to carry out His plan according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This, of course, is not your natural wisdom; it is the crucified Christ as God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we experience the crucified Christ, we are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All that we are, all that we have, and all that we can do all is completely terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To be terminated, there is no need for you to crucify yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is not even any need for you to reckon yourself dead.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You are terminated simply by experiencing the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Actually, it is impossible for anyone to crucify himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, as we are enjoying Him and experiencing Him, His crucifixion will terminate us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All that we are is terminated by this crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Crucifixion is the way for us to be delivered from the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christ crucified is not only the power; He is also the way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To the Jews, such a Christ is an offense, and to the Greeks, He is foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But to us who have been called, the crucified Christ is God s power and God s wisdom for us to be delivered from all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We thank Him and praise Him that we are now in the process of being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The more we are saved by experiencing the crucified Christ, the more we enjoy Him.</S>
