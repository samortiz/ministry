After reading it, I could not help but loudly say amen. Thank God that His thoughts are higher than our thoughts. May He lead His servants to go through all the cities and villages and preach the gospel of the kingdom to the uttermost part of the earth so that billions of souls may be saved from perdition. We pray that the Lord will greatly bless our brothers (the disciples) during this time of war and that everyone will be able to do what Philip did in Samaria, amen. Presently, our meeting place is still at the home of Brother Niu of Chu-Jia-Kou, Hwai-An. Within a ten-mile radius from here, we have Ge-Jia-Chuang, Chen-Jia-Wei, and Ma-Bao. If brothers and sisters seeking refuge from the war want to come, we will be happy to provide hospitality for them. May the Lord grant us peace.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Kao Hung-ru, Niu Mai-jen, Chang Dien-kui<br />[Address omitted]</p>
