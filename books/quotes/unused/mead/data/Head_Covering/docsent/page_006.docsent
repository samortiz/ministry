   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A SIGN OF SUBMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FOR THE SAKE OF THE ANGELS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 11:6 says, For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, God is telling the sisters that they should be absolute in everything that they do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one can leave her head uncovered yet at the same time keep her hair.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a woman is not covered, her hair should be cut off or shaved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you feel that it is shameful to have your hair cut off or shaved, you should cover your head.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what Paul means.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A woman should cut off or shave her hair if she does not want to be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a woman thinks that it is shameful to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She must be absolute one way or the other and not do anything halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 7 says, For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God s image and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A man represents God s image and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He should not have his head covered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the woman is the glory of the man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why a woman should have her head covered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A woman cannot express the headship of the man if she does not cover her head.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 8 and 9 are quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both speak of government.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why I say that a person might as well forget 1 Corinthians 11 if he does not understand the matter of government.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 8 says, For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man did not come out of the woman at the time of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The woman was made from the rib taken out of the man during creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The head was Adam, not Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 9 says, For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A woman must be submissive even for the sake of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 10 says, Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible does not say what a woman should use to cover her head.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It says only that her head, the part where her hair is, should be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The reason for doing this is for the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have always considered how wonderful this teaching is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is for the sake of the angels that the sister s head bears the sign of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all know the history of the angels fall.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan became rebellious, but how did he rebel?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He exalted himself to be equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Isaiah 14 says he uplifted himself and wanted to ascend to God s height.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, he exposed his head before God; he was not subject to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Isaiah 14 Satan repeatedly said, I will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I will ascend to heaven;...I will exalt my throne....I will sit upon the mount of assembly....I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will be like the Most High vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was Satan s ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we see the fall of the archangel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Revelation 12 shows us that Satan carried with him a third part of the angels when he was cast down v. 4 . Trying to assume headship without first coming under God s headship was the cause of the fall of the angels!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today the woman bears the sign of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is for the angels!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only in the church do we find the sign of submission on the sisters heads.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This sign in effect declares, Our heads are covered, and we have no head of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not want to be the head; our head is not exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We accept man as the head.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are doing this to testify to the angels that have rebelled that we accept Christ as our Head and we accept God as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the meaning of the phrase for the sake of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we have the sign of submission on our head, that is, when we cover our head, we are rendering the best testimony to the fallen angels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This explains why Satan is against head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Head covering puts him to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are doing what he did not do before God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What God did not obtain among the angels, He has obtained in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some of the angels did not subject themselves to the authority of God and the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This brought in chaos to the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The fallen angels and the fallen Satan pose a greater problem than the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What God could not obtain from the fallen angels, He has obtained in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When many sisters in the church stand in the position of a woman and cover their heads, an unspoken and implicit testimony is displayed before the angels in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It tells them that God has gained what He is after in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, the woman should have the sign of submission on her head for the sake of the angels.</S>
