   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PATRIARCHS Scripture Reading: Gen 3:15, 20, 21; 4:4, 26; 5:22, 24; 6:9, 14; 7:7; 12:1; 26:4; 28:12-14, 16-19; 32:28; 41:40-41</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We worship You that You are still speaking today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How we thank You for all the divine provisions for Your speaking!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank You that You have an oracle of all Your saints on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have given us the blood, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, how much we trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We trust in Your cleansing blood and Your anointing Spirit and Your enlightening Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How good that we are all sitting around Your Word, even around Yourself!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, do visit us, and anoint every attendant.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Anoint the hearts, the minds, and the spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Anoint the speaking and the listening.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, be with us throughout the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, meet every need.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, even meet Your need through the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Reveal Yourself to us, and take away all the veils.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Remove all the coverings that we may have a clear sky above us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank You, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need a central view of God s divine dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some Bible teachers in the past have pointed out that there are seven dispensations revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first is the dispensation of innocence, which was before Adam s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The second is the dispensation of conscience, which is after the fall and to the time of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The third dispensation is that of human government, which was from Noah to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fourth is the dispensation of promise, which was from Abraham to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These four dispensations are covered by one book, Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fifth dispensation is that of law, which covers the rest of the Old Testament from Exodus through Malachi.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sixth dispensation is that of grace, which covers almost the entire New Testament from John the Baptist to the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The last dispensation, the seventh, is the dispensation of the kingdom, the one-thousand-year reign of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although this teaching is right, they didn t point out clearly what is the ultimate goal of all these dispensations of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These dispensations are steps of God s divine system and arrangement and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of course, some might say that through all these dispensations God was working out His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we would ask, What is God s salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is it just to forgive us our sins and just to bring us into heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Or is it something further?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is the goal of all these dispensations?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is God s goal in His full salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The entire Bible consummates in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the first two chapters of the Bible God clearly shows us that His intention is to have a Bride bearing His image, possessing His life, and being transformed and built up as a Bride to match Him, to satisfy Him, and to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s eternal intention is not just to save a group of sinners and bring them into heaven, but to have a glorious Bride to be His counterpart to match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How He is, this Bride should also be.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This Bride will be a match to the Triune God for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is much, much greater than forgiveness of sin or going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is to make all of us a part of God just like a wife is a part of her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is going to reach His goal through all the dispensations and complete His work of making us His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He began to work in Genesis 3, and He works through the entire Old Testament and the New Testament to reach His goal, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God s goal is a city which will be His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The entire city of the New Jerusalem will be a Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It will be a corporate Bride bearing His glorious image to express Him, built up with God the Father s nature, through God the Son s death and resurrection, and by God the Spirit s transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This city will be nourished and supplied and fed all the time with the divine life signified by the river of water of life and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then in the entire universe there will be such an organism to match God, to be His Bride, His counterpart, to satisfy Him and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is God s goal in His dispensations, and today the proper church life is just a miniature of this Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hallelujah for such a goal!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this message we want to look at the book of Genesis from a bird s eye view.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you have such a view of Genesis you will realize that it is composed of eight great persons with an annex.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, and Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are also Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph as an annex to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In our life-study on Genesis we pointed out that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob depict one complete person with Joseph as an annex.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>So there are two groups and a total of nine great men as landmarks of the human race.</S>
