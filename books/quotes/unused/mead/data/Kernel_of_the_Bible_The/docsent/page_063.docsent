   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STANDING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today, at the end of this age, there is need for the recovery of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There needs to be a church in Rome and in every major city in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the city of Rome there are certainly a good number of saved ones, even among the Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But these true believers are still in the wrong place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If even a small number would take the standing of the church in Rome, there would be a genuine local church there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If that small number standing as the church are not the church, then what would you call them?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some may argue that the church in Rome includes all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But do you think it is possible to bring all the true believers in the Catholic Church living in Rome back to the church?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether or not we are the church depends upon our standing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are standing upon any divisive ground, we are not the church; we are a division.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But as long as we are standing on the ground of unity, we are the church in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE NEED FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The time is short.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord is coming soon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we have pointed out, before His coming back, He needs to complete the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It would be a shame to Him to come back without finishing this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Look at today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Look at the Catholic Church, the denominations, and the free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a mess!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What a confusion!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is not all this a shame to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How could He come back to such a situation?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where is the fulfillment of His word in Matthew 16 that He will build His church?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where is the church built upon the rock?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For the sake of His coming back, the Lord must build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now I want to say strongly that the Lord must build His church in the territory of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before Antichrist appears, the Lord Jesus must build His churches in Western Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although many Christians are waiting for the Lord to come back, He is waiting for the building up of His churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise the Lord that our eyes have been opened to see the need of the building of the local churches!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Italy, France, Switzerland, England, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway there is such a need.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How I long that you all would be burdened to go to the major cities in Europe that the Lord might have a church in each of them!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You need to say, Lord, burden me to go to Paris for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lord, burden me to go to Rome so that You may have a church there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>O Lord, burden me for a church in Stockholm.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are faithful to the Lord, honest with Him, and willing to be burdened, even five or seven could move to a city to start the church life there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So many cities need a shining lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paris needs one!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Geneva needs one!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Western Europe is not a heathen land like Mongolia or Tibet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is an old region saturated with Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although this is a land of Christendom, of Christianity, where is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Can the Lord Jesus come back to the Church of England?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Can He come back to the confusion in the free groups?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the Lord came back today, He would be ashamed because the Bride has not been prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose it is the day of your wedding, and your bride is not present.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Would that not be a shame to you?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Certainly no bridegroom would come, stand, and wait for his bride until he was assured that she was prepared and adorned for him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus is coming as the Bridegroom for the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But where is the Bride in all of Western Europe?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not a matter of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I hate the mere doctrine of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I want to see some genuine, living churches.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not care for the number that are in these churches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If there could be a church in Rome with a hundred fifty people who are shining, filled with Christ, and immersed in Christ, the Lord would be able to boast to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He could say, Satan, in your city of Rome I have a shining church!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brothers, you all must be burdened for the churches in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is the use of merely studying the Bible, attending conferences, and listening to messages?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord needs churches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Young people, the Lord needs churches, and you must bear the burden for this.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Surely the Lord desires a church in Madrid, the capital of the old Catholic country of Spain.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Who is willing to be burdened to go there?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord is calling for this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Who will go to Paris?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To London?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To Rome?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In these dark cities there is no lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Oh, the Lord is calling!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Who is willing to be burdened to go to a major city in Europe so that the Lord may have a church there?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord is calling!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is calling you and me to bear the burden for the major cities in Europe that He may have churches built up in the territory of the coming Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Go and tell others that today the Lord needs churches!</S>
