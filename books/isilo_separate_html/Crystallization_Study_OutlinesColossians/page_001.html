<h1 class="title">Christ&mdash;the All-inclusive, Extensive, Preeminent One,<br />
the Centrality and Universality of God&rsquo;s Economy</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:9, 15-18, 27; 2:8, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Christ unveiled in Colossians is the all-inclusive, extensive, preeminent One, the centrality and universality of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1:15-18, 27; 2:16-17; 3:4, 10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Colossians reveals the all-inclusive Christ&mdash;the One who is God, man, and the reality of every positive thing in the universe&mdash;2:9, 16-17.</li>
	<li>For Christ to be the Firstborn of both the original creation and the new creation means that He is both all-inclusive and extensive&mdash;1:15, 18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The extensive Christ is the Christ who is more vast than the universe and who is everything to us&mdash;Eph. 3:18.</li>
		<li>Christ, the Savior in whom we believe, is limitless and inexhaustible; since He is without limitation, the revelation concerning Him must also be without limitation&mdash;vv. 2-5, 8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ is the preeminent One, the One who has the first place in everything&mdash;Col. 1:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Both in the old creation and the new creation, both in the universe and in the church, Christ occupies the first place, the place of preeminence&mdash;vv. 15, 18.</li>
		<li>If we have a vision of the preeminence of Christ, our living and our church life will be revolutionized, for we will realize that in all things Christ must have the first place&mdash;cf. Rev. 2:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ is the centrality and universality, the center and circumference, of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Col. 1:15-27; Eph. 1:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In God&rsquo;s economy Christ is everything; God wants Christ and Christ alone&mdash;the wonderful, preeminent, all-inclusive Christ, who is all and in all&mdash;Matt. 17:5; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s economy; God&rsquo;s dispensing is altogether related to Christ and focused on Him&mdash;Eph. 3:17a.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His economy is to work the wonderful, all-inclusive, extensive Christ into our being as our life and our everything that we may become the corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;Col. 1:27; 3:4, 10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The will of God is that the all-inclusive, extensive Christ be our portion&mdash;1:9, 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In 1:9 God&rsquo;s will refers to Christ; the will of God is profound in relation to our knowing, experiencing, and living the all-inclusive, extensive Christ.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s will is that we know Christ, experience Christ, enjoy Christ, be saturated with Christ, and have Christ become our life and person&mdash;3:4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ dwells in us as our hope of glory&mdash;1:27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We worship the enthroned Christ in the heavens, but we experience, enjoy, and partake of the indwelling Christ in our spirit; we are one with Him in a very subjective way&mdash;3:1; 1:27; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>The Christ who indwells us is not a small, limited Christ but the all-inclusive, extensive Christ&mdash;the One who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, the Head of the Body, and the embodiment of the fullness of God&mdash;Col. 1:15-16, 18-19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ is our life&mdash;3:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The expression <em>our life</em> is a strong indication that we are to experience the all-inclusive Christ, the One who is the reality of every positive thing&mdash;2:16-17.</li>
	<li>The extensive Christ has become our life; universally, He is extensive, but in our personal experience, He is our life, our being.</li>
	<li>Because Christ is our life, all He has and all He has attained and obtained become subjective to us&mdash;Rom. 8:34, 10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ is the unique constituent of the one new man&mdash;Col. 3:10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The content of the church as the new man is Christ alone; in the new man there is room only for Christ, for He is everyone and in everyone.</li>
	<li>In the church as the new man we are in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ, and we subsist together in Christ to be God&rsquo;s expression in Christ&mdash;1:16-17.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s ultimate goal in His economy is to gain the new man constituted with the all-inclusive, extensive Christ&mdash;Eph. 2:15; 4:24; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We should estimate and evaluate everything according to the all-inclusive, extensive Christ&mdash;2:8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the governing principle of all genuine wisdom and knowledge, the reality of all genuine teaching, and the only measure of all concepts acceptable to God.</li>
	<li>Only when we have a clear view of the place of the all-inclusive, extensive Christ in God&rsquo;s economy will we be able to see through delusion and deception.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to be infused, saturated, and permeated with the all-inclusive, extensive Christ until in our experience He is everything to us&mdash;1:27; 2:16-17; 3:4, 10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ is in us, but we need to see Him, know Him, be filled with Him, be saturated with Him, and be absolutely one with Him.</li>
	<li>We should allow the all-inclusive, extensive Christ to fill our whole being and to replace our culture with Himself&mdash;Eph. 3:17a; Col. 3:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The more Christ replaces our natural life and culture with Himself, the more we will be able to declare, &ldquo;To live is Christ&rdquo;; to us to live will be the Christ who takes full possession of us, occupies us, and fills us with Himself&mdash;Phil. 1:21a.</li>
		<li>The all-inclusive, extensive Christ desires to replace every element of our natural life and culture with Himself so that we may be the one new man as His corporate expression; this is the message of the book of Colossians.</li>
