   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Exercising Your Speed</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous two messages we have seen that we need to exercise our spirit, our mouth our tongue , and our voice our sound in the practice of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In prophesying we also need to exercise our speed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our speaking, we must adjust ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not speak too fast or too slow; rather, we need to speak with a good rhythm and a proper speed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some of the saints speak much too rapidly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, it is difficult to "catch" what they are saying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, some of the brothers have learned to insert a "selah," a brief pause, at certain points in their speaking, thus affording their listeners an adequate opportunity to receive their word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is an example of learning to exercise our speed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. Exercising Your Gesture</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In prophesying we also need to exercise our gesture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although I have been speaking for more than sixty years, I feel that I still have not learned adequately to speak with a proper gesture.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a difficult matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To learn to have a proper gesture requires a lifetime of exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Having the proper gesture is a great benefit to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we speak with little or no gesturing, our speaking will appear to be unnatural and lifeless, and it will not be attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we speak with too much gesturing, our speaking will seem to be peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to learn to speak with a gesture that is very spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>E. Exercising Your Accent</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the practice of prophesying, we also need to learn to exercise our accent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our speaking we must have some crucial points with some crucial words.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to learn to accent our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Shouting loudly is not always a proper accent to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes we should speak a certain point slowly to make it a crucial point that can catch people's attention.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our speaking we should care not only for our rhythm, our speed, but also for our accent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should learn to speak with a proper rhythm and a proper accent so that our listeners can hear every word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In speaking we must take care of others' ears.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Exercising to have a proper speed, gesture, and accent is a great help to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>PRACTICING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In addition to learning and exercising, we also need to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A. By Pray-reading a Portion of the Holy Word</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In our practice, first we need to learn to pray-read a portion of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not merely read the Word, nor should we merely pray it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must pray-read the holy Word.</S>
