   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may say, "Please do not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not say that Christ was made sin."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that Christ was made sin for us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Christ was hanging on the cross, He was sin in the eyes of God.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not only sinners, but we are sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That Christ became flesh means that Christ became sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He became sin for us in order to condemn sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 8:3 says, "God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh."</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first Adam was Adam our fore-father, and the last Adam was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The last Adam is the conclusion of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The last of anything is the end of that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So, the last Adam is the end of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a man, He ended the Adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah, Adam is terminated in Christ!</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we are in the second Man, and we are in the new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah, in Christ as the last Adam we have been terminated, and in Christ as the second Man we are in the new beginning!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be terminated is to be crucified; to be in the new beginning is to be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are in Christ as the last Adam, and we are also in Him as the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Him, on one hand, we have been terminated, and in Him, on the other hand, we have a new beginning.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In His human life there was nothing but suffering, so Isaiah gave Him the title "a Man of sorrows."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means Christ has tasted all the sufferings of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a man, He was a Man of sorrows.</S>
