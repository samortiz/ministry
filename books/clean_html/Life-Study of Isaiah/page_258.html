<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Making His Soul an Offering for Sin<br>and Seeing a Seed</H2><P>According to verse 10b, Christ made His soul an offering for sin. Sin is a common title that includes trespasses, iniquities, wrongdoings, and every wrong or evil thing. Christ's making His soul an offering for sin indicates that He was willing and volunteered to sacrifice Himself as an offering for sin. By doing this, Christ entered into resurrection, in which He produced a seed. This was His satisfaction, and this was also the Father's pleasure.</P><P>The seed produced by Christ in His resurrection is His believers for the building up of His Body as His continuation, with which He will extend His days. Christ extended His days by producing a seed&#151;the believers&#151;to build up the Body of Christ, and this Body of Christ is still extending. As the Body of Christ is extending, the days of Christ also are extending.</P><P>At the end of verse 10 we are told that Christ will prosper in the pleasure of Jehovah. In the past two thousand years Christ has been very prosperous. He has been the most successful One. Although He encountered all kinds of attacks, all kinds of opposition, and all kinds of troubles, no one has been able to defeat Him. Instead, He has prospered. The Lord has prospered in spreading His recovery to America, and now He is preparing to spread to Russia. That too will be Christ's prospering. This is also the prolonging of His days. Christ still lives on this earth. Since we are here, Christ is here.</P><P>In 52:13 we were told only that Christ will prosper, but we were not told in what He will prosper. Now, in 53:10 we are told clearly that He will prosper in the pleasure of Jehovah. The pleasure of Jehovah is to reveal Himself into us, to make us the seed of Christ, to make us a part of Christ, to make us the sons of God. This is God's pleasure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Seeing the Issue of the Travail of His Soul<br>and Being Satisfied</H2><P>Isaiah 53:11 says, "He will see the issue of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant will make the many righteous, / And He will bear their iniquities." The issue of the travail of Christ's soul refers to the many who are justified (made righteous) by knowing Christ, for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ. Acts 13:39 says, "And from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified." All the justified ones will also be regenerated. They will all become Christ's seed; they will all become the members of His Body to build up the Body as His organism.</P>
