   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Son is our life supply as manna, even the hidden manna John 6:32-33, 48-51, 57b; 1 Cor 10:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 6 the Lord compared Himself to the heavenly manna that was given to the children of Israel in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the seven epistles in Revelation written by the Lord Jesus to His seven churches, Jesus is revealed as the hidden manna 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is the real manna for our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Son is also our life supply as the tree of life with its fruit Rev 2:7; 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The tree of life is seen in both Genesis and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Revelation 2:7 the tree of life is promised as a reward to the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Revelation 22:2, 14, and 19, it is a complete fulfillment of God's intention in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In eternity future, we will be in the New Jerusalem enjoying Christ as our life supply, as the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eating results in the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the early church, there was a heretical teaching concerning the mingling which said that the mingling of divinity and humanity produces a third nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because of this heresy, nearly everyone avoided the truth concerning mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in the Bible there is a strong revelation concerning the mingling of the divine nature with the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is typified by the meal offering in the Old Testament, composed of fine flour mingled with oil Lev 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fine flour signifies humanity, and the oil signifies the Holy Spirit with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Oil mingled with fine flour signifies that divinity is mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is a third entity produced but not a third nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This third entity is not merely oil or fine flour, but a cake made of oil mingled with fine flour, signifying the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After this mingling these two natures remain distinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They remain two natures without a third nature being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, there is a third entity, but not a third nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever we eat, digest, and assimilate is mingled with us and even becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why dieticians say that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A little boy becomes big and strong by being mingled with what he eats.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What we eat is assimilated into us and eventually becomes our very fiber and tissue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 6:57 the Lord said that he who eats Him would live because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God in Christ is good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His being food is for the dispensing of Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The dispensing of the Son is also seen in Ephesians 3:8, which reveals that the unsearchable riches of Christ the Son are for the New Testament ministry in the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people claim that they have a ministry, which is a service, but what is the content of their service?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do we minister Christ as the food supply to His believers?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not, we do not have a real, genuine, adequate ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The real, genuine, adequate ministry in the New Testament is the divine stewardship which ministers the Triune God in Christ to people as their life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In all the messages I have given throughout the years, my unique burden has been to minister Christ to God's people as their life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This truth is expressed in Hymns, #509, the chorus of which says:</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is in Christ to be my supply,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God as the Spirit nourisheth me;</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If upon Christ in spirit I feed,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Filled with His life I'll be.</S>
