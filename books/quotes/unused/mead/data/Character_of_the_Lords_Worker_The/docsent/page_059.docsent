   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers and sisters, are you reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Are you stable?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are you unwavering?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you have learned all that God wants you to learn, you will have the keys.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These keys first opened the door to the Jews, and then the door to the Gentiles, and the church is built up this way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must remember the principle that God secures ministers before He builds the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God first looks for ministers, and then He builds the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The doors in many places can only be opened when God finds suitable and usable ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If His ministers and servants are not stable and reliable, these doors will not be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank God that Peter saw his weakness through his failure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His fall was severe and his failure great.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He went away and wept.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He knew that he could not make it by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many brothers and sisters are likewise fully conscious of their own weakness, instability, and frailty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us pray to the Lord, saying, "Lord, I cannot make it!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people pray for light, yet very often great failures are a source of great light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These failures can provide as much a light as a severe rebuke or a seething message.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A man should prostrate himself before God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He should prostrate himself before a severe rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Likewise, he should prostrate himself before a serious failure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a failure is a light in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God shows through failures the kind of person one is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter wept bitterly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But God's mercy was upon him, and he became a real "Peter."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was changed from a weak and shaking person to a solid and stable person, and the door of Pentecost was opened through him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May the Lord be gracious to us so that we will witness a change in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our character has to be changed, and the Lord can change our character.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A lazy man can be changed into a diligent man; a talkative man can be changed into a man of few words; an insensitive man can be changed into a man who listens; a man who is afraid of sufferings can be changed into one who is fearless in the face of sufferings; a man who cannot control his body can be changed into one who is a master of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, a weak, shaky, and wobbly man can be changed into a strong, stable, and unwavering man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
