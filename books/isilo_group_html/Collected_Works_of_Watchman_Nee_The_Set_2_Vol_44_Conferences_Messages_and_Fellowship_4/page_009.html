Since the Bible uses both titles when it addresses Him, there must be a distinction between these two titles. Today we want to see the meanings of these two titles.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD<br />BEING THE SON OF GOD</h2><p>Concerning the Lord as the Son of God, we have the angel in Luke 1:35 who spoke this title to Mary. Peter received revelation from the Father and knew the Lord as the Son of God in Matthew 16:16. According to Romans 1:4, the Lord was designated the Son of God out of resurrection. According to John 20:31, a man is saved and receives God's life when he believes in the Son of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD<br />BEING THE CHRIST</h2><p>Concerning the Lord as the Christ, we have the angels in Luke 2:11 who declared that He is the Christ to the shepherds. Peter received revelation from the Father and knew Him as the Christ in Matthew 16:16. According to Acts 2:36, the Lord was made Christ after His resurrection. According to John 20:31, a man is saved through believing that Jesus is the Christ.</p><p>We can clarify this by the following chart:</p><div style="text-align:center"><table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="550"><tr><td><div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">The Lord Being the Son of God</div></td><td><div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">The Lord Being the Christ</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><ol class="decimal"><li>Spoken by the angel to Mary<br />(Luke 1:35)<br /><br /></li><li>Received by Peter as revelation<br />from the Father (Matt. 16:16)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></li><li>Designated out of resurrection<br />(Rom. 1:4)<br /><br /></li><li>Man's being saved by believing it<br />(John 20:31)</li></ol></td><td valign="top"><ol class="none"><li>Spoken by the angels to<br />the shepherds (Luke 2:11)<br /><br /></li><li>Received by Peter as<br />revelation from the Father<br />(Matt. 16:16)<br /><br /></li><li>Appointed by God after<br />resurrection (Acts 2:36)<br /><br /></li><li>Man's being saved by<br />believing it (John 20:31)</li></ol></td></tr></table></div><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 44: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (4) &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
