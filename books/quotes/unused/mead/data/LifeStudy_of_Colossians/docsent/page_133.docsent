   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING WITH THE INCREASE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden in this message is to help the saints see what the genuine growth in life is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Growth is not a matter of becoming refined instead of crude.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To grow in life is to grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is to grow with the increase of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>True growth is the increase of God, the addition of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Himself, God does not need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is eternal, perfect, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, there is the need for God to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How much of the Triune God do you have within you?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you not need more of the increase, the addition, of God within you?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all need the increase of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to grow with the growth of God; that is, we need God to increase, to grow, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I repeat, in Himself God cannot grow and does not need to grow, but it is necessary for God to grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to have genuine growth, we must first be rooted in Christ, our good land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This implies that Christ is our soil, our earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Otherwise, how could we be rooted in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are plants rooted in Christ as the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, Christ, the processed, all-inclusive Triune God, is our land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise the Lord that we have been planted!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having been planted into Christ, we are now rooted in the living Christ who is our good land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From 1:12 we see that Christ is the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have previously pointed out, the Greek word rendered portion actually means a lot, a tract of land.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ as our portion is our lot.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that He is the good land to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the children of Israel entered into the land of Canaan and took possession of it, they all received their portion, their allotment, of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today our lot is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This lot, this portion, is the soil in which we are rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is the fertile soil in which we, the plants, are growing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This soil is living and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because we have been rooted into Christ as such a living soil, we move when He moves, for we walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, our walking is not actually ours; it is His.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a walking in Christ as the good land is also our growing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To grow is to walk in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, when we walk in Christ, we grow in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a tree grows, it absorbs water and nourishing elements from the soil in which it is rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A tree grows by absorbing the riches from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As these riches are absorbed by the tree, they become the increase of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The tree grows with the increase of the riches from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In like manner, we are living plants rooted in Christ as our soil.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is moving, and because we are in Him, we walk as He moves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, those Christians who have no heart to seek the Lord do not walk when Christ moves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They do not cooperate with Him in His moving.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But as those who love the Lord and pursue Him, we should always cooperate with Him and say Amen whenever He moves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should be very active and aggressive in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through this experience of walking in Christ we absorb the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our walking in Christ is the cooperation we render to Him in His activity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By cooperating with Him in this way, we spontaneously absorb His riches into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What we absorb of Christ into us the element of the riches of Himself as the soil becomes the increase of God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our land is Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the land is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that when we absorb the riches of the soil, we absorb the riches of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Actually, we absorb the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Through this absorption, we take more of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This increase of God within us is what we mean by the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are living plants rooted into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now our roots are absorbing the riches of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As a result, God is added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This addition of the riches of the soil within us is our growth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>About three years ago, we planted some trees around our house.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In these three years, the trees have grown very much.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This growth has been the increase of the riches of the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By the roots of the trees, the riches from the soil have been brought into the trees and absorbed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The trees are continually absorbing the riches of the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this way these riches become the very element for the increase of the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this way the trees grow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a picture, an illustration, of the genuine growth in spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It also shows us the way to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We praise the Lord that after years of wandering without a goal, so many of us are now rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is a blessing to be rooted in Christ in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once we have been rooted in the church, we are not easily uprooted.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We cannot even uproot ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some who tried to give up the church life because something had made them unhappy found that their efforts were not successful.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They had been rooted, and they could not be uprooted.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Instead of trying to uproot ourselves, we should be subdued by the Lord and allow Him to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we realize that we have been rooted in Him, we shall automatically walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>According to 2:6 and 7, the rooting must precede the walking.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Having been rooted in Christ, we now walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We simply remain in Christ, and He does the walking.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thus, His walking becomes our walking.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Spiritual things cannot fully be explained.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Only through experience can they be apprehended adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>From our experience we realize that when Christ moves, we walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then the roots embedded in the soil absorb the riches of the Triune God into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Through the addition of God in us, we then grow with the growth of God.</S>
