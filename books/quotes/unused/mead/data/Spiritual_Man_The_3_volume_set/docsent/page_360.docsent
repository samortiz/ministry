   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NATURAL POWER AND THE LIFE OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we fully consecrate ourselves to God, we can believe that He has indeed prepared a body for us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We often think that it would have been great if we could have decided how our body was to be formed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our greatest hope is that our body would be free from so many natural defects and that it would have greater resistance so that we could enjoy a longer life without pain and illness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But God did not consult us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He knew what we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not blame our forefathers for their mistakes and sins; neither should we doubt God's love and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything which concerns us was decided before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has His good intention in giving us a body that is prone to being limited by pain and illness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His purpose is not for us to forsake this body or consider it a burden; instead, He wants us to lay hold of a new body by the indwelling Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He prepared our body for us, He knew all of its limitations and dangers, intending that we would seek a new body through our painful experiences, one which does not live by our natural strength but by the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus we can exchange our weakness for His strength and realize that even though our body has not become new, the life by which it lives is already new.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord loves to saturate our every nerve, blood vessel, and cell with His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He does not exchange our weak constitution for a strong one, nor does He simply impart a great amount of strength to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He desires to be the life of our body so that we may live by Him every moment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some may think that receiving the Lord Jesus as the life of our body means that God conducts a miracle to transfuse a great amount of strength into our body, with the result being that we will no longer suffer or become sick throughout our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this was not the apostle's experience; he said, "For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His flesh was always weak, but the life of the Lord Jesus continuously flowed into him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He lived by the life of the Lord moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To receive the Lord Jesus as life for our body requires continued dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In ourselves we cannot deal with the environment for one moment, but through our dependence on the Lord, He will give us the strength we need moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what God meant when He spoke to Jeremiah: "But I will give your own life to you as spoil in all places where you may go" Jer 45:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not feel safe at all in our natural strength; instead, we commit ourselves to the Lord's life for every breath.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is the most security in this because He lives forever.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not have any reserve strength by which to act freely.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, every time we need strength, we must draw breath from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A moment's breath enables us a moment's living; nothing can be put in reserve.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a life completely joined to and dependent upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the secret of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we were able to live independently of the life-giving Lord, would we not be led to follow ourselves and lose our heart of dependence?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Would we not be like those of the world who waste their strength wantonly?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wants us to have continuous needs and continuous dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as manna could be gathered only once daily, so must our body live by God hourly.</S>
