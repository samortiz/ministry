   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FULL VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul, the new man in Christ, was on the one hand caught away to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the other hand, he was caught away to Paradise, the comfortable section of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because Paul came to know the things in heaven and the things under the earth as well as the things on earth, he had a complete view of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anyone who would have a full view of the universe must know these three sections: the third heaven, the earth, and the region under the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul was an educated person concerning the things on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One day the Lord took him away to the third heaven and let him see what was there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He also took him away to Paradise to show him what was there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Regarding Paradise, Paul said that he heard things which it is not allowed a man to speak 2 Cor 12:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, he was not at liberty to tell the Corinthians about them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul, a new man in Christ, certainly had a complete knowledge and a full view of the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Compared to Paul, the Judaizers were like frogs in a well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They could not see beyond the circle of the well of the Old Testament and of Judaism with its rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Paul could boast of visions and revelations of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He could say, Corinthians, the Lord has given me a wonderful view of the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He brought me away to the third heaven, and he brought me to Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Paradise I heard utterances which I am not allowed to speak of.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No wonder Paul refers to the transcendence of the revelations given to him v. 7 . Only two people, Jesus and Paul, have received such a full view of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>REVELATION FOLLOWED BY SUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verses 6 and 7 Paul goes on to say, For if I should desire to boast, I shall not be foolish, for I will speak the truth; but I refrain, lest anyone should account of me above what he sees of me or hears from me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Wherefore also, that I should not be exceedingly lifted up by the transcendence of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, that I should not be exceedingly lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word rendered transcendence also means superabundance, exceeding greatness, excess.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word for thorn is often used in classical Greek in the sense of a stake or of a sharp-pointed staff.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here it may refer to a kind of physical suffering, like the trouble Paul had with his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Greek word for buffet means to beat with a clenched fist.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is different from the word rendered buffet in 1 Corinthians 9:27, a word that means to beat under the eye.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 7 indicates that revelation is always followed by suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For a human being to see a view like that beheld by Paul is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even for Paul there was a risk in seeing such a view.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The danger is that after receiving this kind of transcendent revelation, Paul would be lifted up and become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His sovereignty, the Lord, in order to enlarge Paul and to broaden his view to a universal extent, brought him to the third heaven and also to Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Lord also knew that there was the danger that Paul would be spoiled or damaged by this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, He sent Paul a thorn, a messenger of Satan, to buffet him and cause him pain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The purpose of this thorn was to bring Paul down and keep him low.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we see that it is not a simple matter to be in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes the hand of the Lord will lift us up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But after the Lord has lifted us up, He will bring us down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the Judaizers were not in the Lord s hand, with them there was neither lifting up nor putting down.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, they were like a plain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But Paul s experience was full of mountains and valleys.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that the Lord lifted him up and then brought him down.</S>
