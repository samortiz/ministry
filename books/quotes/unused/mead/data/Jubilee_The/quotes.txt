[1]  In these messages we will consider the year of jubilee.
[2]  The Chinese term for jubilee is not found in traditional Chinese writings; it was invented by the translators of the Chinese Bible, which is one of the best translations in the world.
[3]  The Israelites were redeemed and blessed by God and eventually were brought into the good land of Canaan, and each family was allotted their portion of the land.
[4]  Under God s care, not only were the Israelites blessed, but even their land was blessed.
[5]  The Lord told Paul, I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me Acts 26:17b-18 .
[6]  As we have seen, the inheritance referred to in this verse is God Himself.
[7]  Paul exhorts us to receive the Lord right away because now is the acceptable year of the Lord, the year of jubilee.
[8]  If we have jubilee, we have God; if we have God, we have grace.
[9]  According to the dispensation, Christ has already come, so the age of jubilee is here, but we do not have the jubilee in us unless we have allowed the Lord Jesus to come into us.
[10]  Not only so, even if we have believed into Christ and have allowed Him to come into us, unless we allow Him to live in us and unless we live by Him, we are not practically living in the jubilee.
[11]  Christ is our jubilee whenever we live by Him, but He is not our jubilee when we do not live by Him.
[12]  In the previous message we have seen something concerning the age of the jubilee.
[13]  The jubilee refers not only to a day or a year but to an entire period of time.
[14]  In typology the jubilee lasted a year, but in fulfillment it refers to the entire New Testament age and the millennium.
[15]  To God s chosen people, the entire New Testament age is the age of the jubilee.
[16]  Exodus 1 shows us that when God s elect, the Israelites, fell into Egypt, they not only lost their possession but were afflicted and enslaved by Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
[17]  We must now consider what man s possession is.
[18]  The land is not our real possession; rather, God is our possession.
[19]  When we preach the gospel, we proclaim God s jubilee to others.
[20]  The proclamation of the jubilee in Luke 4 governs the central thought of the whole Gospel of Luke, and the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15 is an excellent illustration of the jubilee.
[21]  God is our inheritance, and after we are saved, the Spirit of God is in us as the pledge, the guarantee, the proof, and the security of our inheritance.
[22]  Today the Holy Spirit is in us as the guarantee, the sample, of God as our enjoyment, giving us a foretaste and guaranteeing our full enjoyment of God in the future.
[23]  Even though they have God, they are like lights that do not shine because they do not turn on the switch by taking God as their portion.
[24]  CHAPTER THREE THE FREEDOM OF THE JUBILEE Scripture Reading: Lev 25:39-41, 54; Luke 4:18-19; Acts 26:18; John 8:34, 36; Rom 7:14; 6:6-7; 8:2; Gal 5:1 ENJOYING GOD AS THE POSSESSION OF THE JUBILEE
[25]  In the preceding chapter we saw the possession of the jubilee, and in this message we shall see the freedom of the jubilee.
[26]  Our possession is God, and our freedom comes from our enjoyment of God.
[27]  How we thank God that today He is our possession, and when we enjoy Him, we have freedom!
[28]  The New Testament clearly tells us that without God, we lose our possession; that is, we do not enjoy God, and consequently we sell ourselves into slavery.
[29]  However, when people only speak about freedom without being returned to God, the result is that many problems are produced and many evil things are brought in. Who has obtained real freedom? If someone says that he is so free that he can go freely to gamble, he does not realize that he has fallen into the slavery of gambling and is under more bondage than ever.
[30]  Therefore, when the Bible speaks of the year of jubilee, the first thing it teaches is that man must be returned to God.
[31]  According to the Old Testament type, when the year of jubilee came, a person who had sold himself into slavery was returned to his own possession and to his own family to be reunited with his relatives, and at the same time he was also released from the yoke of slavery and was no longer a slave.
[32]  When we lost God, we became poor, and the result of poverty was that we were captured.
[33]  CHAPTER FOUR THE LIVING OF THE JUBILEE Scripture Reading: Lev 25:10-12; Psa 90:9-10; 73:14-17, 25; Eccl.
[34]  1:2-3; Rom 8:19-21; Matt 11:28; Phil 4:6-7, 9; 1 Cor 5:8; Eph 3:8; Phil 1:19; 2 Cor 12:9; 13:14 RECOVERING OUR LOST PORTION
[35]  In the first chapter, we saw that the Lord has come to bring in the New Testament age as the age of the jubilee.
[36]  God has become our inheritance, the portion of our cup, and our eternal dwelling place in all generations.
[37]  The jubilee is to return those who are poor and who have lost God back to God as their possession, and it is also to proclaim release.
[38]  This is because when man thinks of God, the fear of God is aroused in him, and when he begins to fear God, he comes under the philosophy that God will be kind to him and that the more he fears God, the more prosperous he will become, the healthier he will be, the more children and grandchildren he will have, and the more he will have good fortune and not misfortune.
[39]  THE SECRET OF A CHRISTIAN S ENJOYMENT OF REST
[40]  The book of James in the New Testament says that we need to consider the experience of Job and remember how he endured 5:11 .
[41]  God did not promise that we Christians will have everything to our satisfaction on earth.
[42]  Yes, everything is to our satisfaction but not the things themselves; rather, our satisfaction is in God.
[43]  He could be anxious in nothing because he made known all his requests to God; thus, the peace of God, which surpasses every man s understanding, guarded his heart and his thoughts in Christ Jesus v. 7 . In this way, he enjoyed the presence of the God of peace.
[44]  As fallen ones, we may have the fallen natural concept that if we fear God, serve Him, love Him, and follow Him, we will prosper in everything; the unhealthy will become healthy and the foolish will become wise.
