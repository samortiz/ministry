   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Live and Walk according to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another requirement on the believers for their meetings is that they must live and walk according to the spirit to live a victorious life Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After making a thorough confession, we have to begin a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not fall back into our old life about which we have just confessed thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must begin to have a new life, and this new life is to have our being absolutely in the spirit day after day and all day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To Let the Word of Christ Dwell in Us Richly</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not only to read the word but also to receive the word and give it the freedom to act and operate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must give ourselves to the word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must let the word take us as its home so that it can work and operate within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To Speak the Lord at All Times</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For our meetings, we also need to be those who speak the Lord at all times to all kinds of people on any occasion Acts 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul told Timothy, Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regardless of the situation or circumstances, we have to speak the Lord at all times to all kinds of people on any occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In season and out of season means opportunely or inopportunely, whether the opportunity is convenient or inconvenient, whether we are welcome or unwelcome.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To Become Acquainted</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>with Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For our meetings, we must become acquainted with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs for teaching and admonishing one another Col 3:16b .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all have to learn the hymns in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may not be able to remember that many, but we can choose to remember the better hymns and learn to speak them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes we need to speak a hymn or a verse of a song to a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can do the same thing when we come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To Pay the Price to Prepare to Speak</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The meetings also require us to pay the price to prepare to speak, not only to listen, in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This preparation is not like the preparation of a student who has been asked to give a speech.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This might frighten most of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not need to pay that kind of price.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But day after day we must get ourselves prepared to have something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the old way of meeting, one speaks and the rest listen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no need for the ones who listen to get themselves prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today the way of meeting has been changed so that everybody has to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, whenever we come to the meetings, we must get ourselves prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not prepare only instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to prepare constantly every day, every week, and every month.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we will have an accumulation of the riches of Christ that we can speak of and with.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To Endeavor to Make the Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Full of Mutuality</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We also need to endeavor to make the meetings full of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many different persons should speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more mutual the meeting is, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose that fifty saints came together, and everybody wanted to speak at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I wanted to speak before you, and you wanted to speak before me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That meeting would be in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose that the same fifty persons came together and all of them were dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even the three elders among them could only look at one another with nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>None of them could speak something to meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That meeting would be a dead meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It would be dead to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead of sitting there in dumbness, if everyone would open their mouths to speak something of Christ one after another, the meeting would become a living, uplifted meeting, full of the divine riches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>With only one speaker, there is only one course of food.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is a one course feast rich?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When fifty saints come together, though, and everyone speaks, there is a fifty course feast full of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There will be exhortations, admonitions, revelations unveiling Christ, and other divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That is a meeting that is not only living but also rich.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some may say that the new way is too hard, but if we would try to speak, it is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do not speak, it is hard because everybody is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must try to be living in the meeting, not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It would be good if we would make a pledge to speak for at least forty seconds whenever we are in any kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To Exercise the Spirit and to Be Energetic in Life</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In conclusion, we need to exercise the spirit and be energetic in life that the meetings may be high, rich, living, fresh, full of Christ, and enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we are energetic in life, we may come to the meeting and say, Brothers, do you realize that I am a God-man?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All of you are God-men too!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not be in the meetings in our weak self.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must learn to exercise our spirit and be energetic.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then we will experience mercy reaching us and grace supplying us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This kind of exercise and energy in life will make the entire meeting very enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the way to fulfill the requirements of the proper meeting of the believers so that we can give praise to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then whatever we do will be a praise to the Father.</S>
