   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AUTHORITY AND SUBMISSION PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1949 Watchman Nee released a series of messages on authority and submission in a co-workers' training held in Kuling, Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All who were present in the meetings fell prostrate in the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They had a deep sensation that the work of the unlawful one really fills the earth, while at the same time, the feeling of the Lord's saved ones is very insensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the end of this age, how can the kingdom of God be brought in if the children of God do not bear a testimony for the Lord in submission?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the last ten years some have edited these precious messages into outlines to be used as study material, and others have distributed copies of personal notes for study.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet all of these are too brief and incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the Gospel Book Room gathered all of the available notes and edited them into eleven messages which were published in a series in the Ministry of the Word magazine last year.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of the inadequacy of the notes, we feel that these messages as published are still short in content and deviate much from Brother Nee's original utterance and tone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As such, they can only be considered as the most detailed notes available.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To meet the need of God's children in all the localities, we have put these eleven messages into this book with the hope that the Lord will make provisions for a more perfect record to be published in the future.</S>
