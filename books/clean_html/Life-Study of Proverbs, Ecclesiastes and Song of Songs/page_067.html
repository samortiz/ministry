<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. BY CHRIST'S RESURRECTION POWER<br>
THROUGH HIS FELLOWSHIP</H2>

<P>The lover of Christ is called to be delivered from the self through her oneness with the cross by Christ's resurrection power through His fellowship (S.S. 2:8-9).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Coming, Leaping upon the Mountains<br>
and Skipping upon the Hills</H2>

<P>"The voice of my beloved! Now he comes,/Leaping upon the mountains,/Skipping upon the hills" (v. 8). This leaping and skipping signifies Christ's power to overcome difficulties and barriers. As the One in resurrection, He surely has a way to overcome difficulties and barriers. All the troubles concerning our fellowship with Christ come from our side. Many "hills" and "mountains" frustrate us from coming to Him, but He is never frustrated, for He can "leap" and "skip."</P>

<P>How can we go to the cleft of the rock, to the covert of the precipice? We do not have the strength to do this. The only way that we can go to the cross is by the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10). Therefore, Christ comes to the self-satisfied seeker in the power of resurrection.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being Like a Gazelle or a Young Hart</H2>

<P>"My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart" (S.S. 2:9a). The word hind in the title of Psalm 22, which is concerned with resurrection, signifies Christ in resurrection. Christ's being like a young hart signifies that His power is the power of resurrection.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Standing behind "Our Wall"</H2>

<P>"Now he stands behind our wall" (v. 9b). His standing behind "our wall" signifies that the lover's introspection as the problem in her self is a separation between her and Him.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Looking through the Windows and<br>
Glancing through the Lattice</H2>

<P>"He is looking through the windows,/He is glancing through the lattice" (v. 9c). The windows and the lattice signify the openings set up by God for Him to fellowship, to commune, with her. No matter how much we try to hide ourselves secretly, there is a window that Christ can see through. Because man became fallen, there seemed to be no way for God to touch man or have fellowship with man. But the conscience of man is the window with a lattice, which is open for God to come in to contact fallen man. We should keep this in mind when we go out to preach the gospel. As we are preaching the gospel, we need to learn how to touch others' conscience.</P>
