   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REPEATING THE OLD FAILURE After Abraham had left God's presence and had journeyed toward the south, he repeated an old failure lying by sacrificing his wife 20:2; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>12:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To lie is one thing, and to sacrifice our wife is another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although many brothers may lie, perhaps none of them would sacrifice his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But Abraham did it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I admire Sarah for being such a good wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She did not complain but was agreeable with her husband's lie.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE HIDDEN WEAKNESS EXPOSED In 20:8-13 we see Abraham's hidden weakness exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Abraham did not lie accidentally; it was planned from the day he first began to follow the way of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Abraham told Abimelech, "It came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother" v. 13 . This hidden weakness was kept within Abraham even after he had been circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In principle, most of us are the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the one hand, we are following the Lord in the church; on the other hand, we have a reserve.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In case a certain thing happens, we have a reserve plan to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you mean to be absolute with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do, ask Him whether you still hold on to some hidden reserve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although you may not believe that you have a reserve, when you take a vacation from the church life, it will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many young sisters who are following the Lord in the church have a reserve deep within them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They say to themselves, "Maybe some day a certain thing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it does, I know just what I will do about it."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the reserve planned from the time they first began to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, we are living by faith in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But what do we do when our faith fails?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We use our reserve.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps after a short while your weakness will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will prove that in spite of your claim to be absolute, you are still not one hundred percent absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I believe that the purpose of this record in chapter twenty is to show us that sooner or later our hidden reserve will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible is different from any worldly book, for it is a genuine and honest record of a God-seeking people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However much we seek after God, we still have a reserve.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I fear and tremble that perhaps there is still deep within me a hidden reserve that one day will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>PRESERVED BY GOD'S SOVEREIGN CARE In the Bible, Abraham, in figure, stands for faith and Sarah stands for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words, in the presence of God, a man always stands for faith and the wife always stands for God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abraham was the father of faith, and his life was a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since Sarah is the figure of God's grace, for Isaac to be born of her meant that he was born of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ishmael, on the contrary, was born of Hagar, of the law, of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In figure, whenever faith becomes a failure, grace is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that when faith fails on our side, grace suffers on the Lord's side.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Each time Abraham failed, Sarah suffered, and when Sarah suffered, grace suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, grace and testimony go together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever we have grace, we have the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Abraham lied, he did not have the enjoyment of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, he lost his testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever faith fails, grace suffers, and the testimony of grace is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God came in to rescue Sarah and to restore her.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In figure, this means that God came in to take care of His grace and His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God knows how to sovereignly protect His grace and preserve His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not know how many times we have been in danger of damaging grace and losing the testimony because we have left the proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But at a certain juncture, God came in to deal with the circumstances so that the testimony of His grace might be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this had been clear to Abraham, he would not have lied; he would have believed that God would care for His grace and His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although Abraham's faith failed, God still preserved him by His sovereign care vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>3-7, 14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because Abraham's experience had become abnormal, God did not appear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In chapters eighteen and nineteen, God appeared to Abraham but not to Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here in chapter twenty, He did not appear to Abraham; He appeared to Abimelech in a dream v. 3 . In a sense, Abraham's standing in chapter twenty was nearly the same as Lot's in chapter nineteen.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, God appeared to Abimelech, a Gentile king, telling him that the one who had lied to him was His prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Abimelech was surprised to hear that one of God's prophets had lied to him at the sacrifice of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this chapter, we see God's wisdom, sovereignty, fairness, and care.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Leaving Abraham, the one who had lied, God spoke to Abimelech, the one who had been cheated, saying, "Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife" v. 3 . Abimelech was shocked.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then God told him that he must restore Abraham's wife and that Abraham would pray for him v. 7 . God did not inspire Abraham to pray for Abimelech; rather, He indicated to Abimelech that Abraham was a prophet and had the position to pray for the king and his family.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In doing this, God did not rebuke Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although Abraham was outside God's presence, God still preserved His testimony and gave Abraham many riches vv.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When Abraham defeated Chedorlaomer and the other kings and rescued Lot, he refused to accept anything from the king of Sodom because he had the Most High God 14:21-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, when Abimelech gave Abraham sheep, oxen, servants, and silver, Abraham did not dare to say, "I don't need your help.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have the Most High God."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He did not have the position to say this, and his mouth was shut.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I do not believe that Abraham thanked Abimelech for his gifts or was happy to receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When he received all those gifts from Abimelech in front of Sarah, he must have been ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God wisely and sovereignly restored Sarah, taking care of His grace and His testimony, and at the same time He disciplined Abraham.</S>
