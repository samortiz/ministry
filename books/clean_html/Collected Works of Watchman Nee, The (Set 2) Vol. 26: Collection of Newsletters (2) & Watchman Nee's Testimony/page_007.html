<h2 class="head1">A SMALL TESTIMONY</h2><p>I lay sick in bed for thirty-one years just like the man in John 5 who was sick for thirty-eight years. Today I have been completely healed by the Lord Jesus. I began studying theology in a denomination in 1903. At first I was baptized by sprinkling, but later I went to another denomination and was baptized by immersion. I have received salaries from several denominations and preached for a few denominations. It was just like in Revelation 3:1 where the Lord said, "I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead." During these thirty-one years, I was living a life that shamed the Lord. Furthermore, because the denominations could not satisfy me, I also sinned for three or four years by not reading the Bible, praying, or going to meetings. I was sixty last year according to the flesh. In November I was sick for twenty days. My physical body was very weak. In March of this year, Brother Ke Ts'ung Yi came to Chin Chia Pien Elementary School, Kao Tze, to teach. He zealously exhorted me to obey the Lord. Later, I asked Brother Ke to clearly explain some of the things I doubted. After hearing his explanations, it seemed as if scales fell off my eyes. I was able to see. I thanked, obeyed, and praised the Lord. Now there are a few matters I would like the brothers and sisters in the Lord to pray for on my behalf. First, please ask the Lord to keep me and strengthen me to the end. Second, please ask the Lord Himself to do a good work in me and glorify Himself through this useless, weak vessel to testify for Himself. Third, please ask the Lord to save my wife, son, daughter, son-in-law, and my grandchildren, that our whole house may believe in the Lord and be saved. Fourth, please ask the Lord to establish a place for a meeting in the Lord's name so that those who believe in the Lord with a pure heart will have a place to meet and partake of the Lord's table. Fifth, please implore the Lord to work in my circumstances that I may always glorify and obey Him. Also pray that my home would be near a meeting in the Lord's name. Sixth, please pray that the Lord would add saved ones into His precious name every day so that the lost sheep may become a flock under the hand of the great Shepherd, our Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah, amen. Finally, I bless all the brothers and sisters in the Lord. Health in spirit and body!</p><p>The smallest brother in the Lord,<br />Feng Ching Yi<br />August 17, 1934</p><p>This letter was sent in by a believer in Kao Tze, Kiangsu who was helped by Brother Ke and was revived.</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS FROM LIEN SHUI, NORTHERN KIANGSU</h2><p>Greetings to our dear brother in the Lord, Watchman:</p><p>May the Holy Spirit within each brother pray for us, the dried-up children. We have been believers in the Inland Mission for many years. We were all blindly zealous and knew nothing about being saved and overcoming. We often sought the truth. We have seen the divisions among the denominations, and when we met brothers who believed in the Lord, we asked, "Which church do you belong to?" Then we praised his church for doing this or that or we discussed the salary the believers gave the preacher. Our spirits were not pleased that we did not speak of the Lord's grace, but we had no alternative. Thank and praise the God who loves man. He sent His faithful and obedient messengers, Chiu Jih Chien and Chi Yung Tung, to Chi T'ang Chi to begin the work there and to give us the truth. This was from July 26 to August 1, 1929. God laid hold of a few of us. Satan also worked by saying, "Chiu and Chi from Su Chia Tsue are speaking the devil's doctrine. The last days are here. There are false apostles and false prophets. The Lord has told us not to believe in them or be led astray." But in our hearts we felt that the Scriptures they quoted were all true. Later we bought some books from Ting Chung Shu, including The Christian Life and Warfare, The Christian, and The Spiritual Man. But we were still cheated; we did not understand, and we placed our flesh in this life at the forefront. We were unable to overcome for three years. The Lord placed us in trials, while Satan raised up some work. The Seventh-day Adventists preach a proper living, the law in the last days, and the commandments. Many worldly people followed. In April and May of 1933, thirty-six people were baptized. Oh, thank the Lord, He enlightened us to see 1 John 4:1-6. All the brothers and sisters in our locality were considering our love for God. The Lord who knows man sent His messenger, Brother Chiu, to us again. In more than ten days of work, God grasped a few brothers and sisters out of the many to meet, break bread, and praise. We were so joyful. We thank the Lord and remember how much He loves us. Our Lord and His cross were livingly depicted before our eyes. Our hearts could not help but respond; we each shed tears. After about fifteen minutes, we read the Bible, broke the bread, and received the cup. It was so sweet. There are seven brothers and four sisters who break bread together. The responsible brothers are Sun Tze Kang and Chi Ju Ch'un.</p><p>We received an issue of Collection of Newsletters and learned about the conference in Shanghai. Satan did a special work. Brother Chi wanted to go, but his wife persecuted and frustrated him. It is difficult to describe the situation in a sentence. The Lord caused him to overcome, and he arrived safely in Shanghai. The devil also worked so that he would have a recurrence of a chronic illness. When he suffers from this illness, it usually lasts for ten days. This time the Lord blessed him in that he was healed after two days. He asked Brother Chi Yung Tung to tell the brothers and sisters who love the Lord to pray for him. Thank the Lord that He heard their prayers.</p><p>In February Sister Chin began a women's work in Yi Lin. The Lord moved a mother and daughter, Chi P'ing Ch'uan, and another sister, Chi Tao Hua, and her daughter, Chi An Yu, to go to Yi Lin for more than twenty days of learning. Chi P'ing Ch'uan and Chi An Yu were both baptized in Yi Lin. They entered into the Lord Jesus' death and are living to God. A sister was baptized here in our locality on April 15. Every Lord's Day, the attendance is more than thirty people. God's promise is true. He adds saved ones to us every day. Every Lord's Day many sick people come.</p><p>We are still meeting in the old meeting place that the China Inland Mission used to occupy. It is in Sun Tze Kang's house. He is saved and his wife obeys, but the rest of the people in the household are unbelievers. We hope that all the brothers and sisters who love the Lord will pray for us before Him. We do not know where God wants to put us because we are young and dry. We do not know what God's will is. Every Lord's Day, a brother who is led by the Holy Spirit gives some testimony. We do not know when God will give a gifted member to His church. May the Lord bless each one of you. Health and peace to your spirit, soul, and body!</p><p>Your little brothers,<br />Sun Tze Kang and Chi Ju Ch'un<br />July 3, 1934</p><p>We cannot write too well, and we are afraid that there are many misused words and incorrect characters. Please forgive us.</p>
