[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Job 1:1-5
[2]  With this message we begin the life-study of Job My burden in these messages can be expressed by the following four sentences:
[3]  1 God deals with His saints for the purpose that they may gain Him as life.
[4]  2 God strips His seekers of their possessions so that they may inherit Him in full.
[5]  The book of Job is named after its writer, Job, whose name means "hated" or "persecuted," signifying what Job suffered of Satan, the enemy of God.
[6]  The book of Job tells us that Job lived in Uz, a city in Edom Lam 4:21 , west of the Arabian desert.
[7]  It was according to His economy and for His intention that God created the universe.
[8]  Job and his friends might have had different views in what they insisted on and debated about regarding God's judgment.
[9]  The subject of the book of Job is the purpose of God's dealing with His holy one.
[10]  Job has six sections: the introduction 1:1 2:10 ; the debates between Job and his three friends 2:11 32:1 ; Elihu's answer to Job 32:2 37:24 ; the dialogue between God and Job 38:1 42:6 ; Jehovah's dealing with the three friends of Job 42:7-9 ; and Job's end 42:10-17 .
[11]  Job 1:1 says, "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and this man was perfect and upright, and he feared God and turned away from evil."
[12]  According to human eyes, there was no problem with Job God even boasted to Satan regarding how good Job was v. 8; 2:3 . Only God knew that Job had a need, that he was short of God.
[13]  Because of His loving concern for Job, God held a council in the heavens to talk about Job
[14]  God could not and would not ask any of His many excellent angels to do what was needed to damage Job Without Satan, there would have been no one to do the ugly work of damaging Job in order to strip him of everything that he might be full of God.
[15]  Job 1:7-12a is a record of God's checking with Satan concerning Job
[16]  For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil" v. 8 . Here God was boasting to Satan regarding Job If we read this carefully, we will see that God's boasting here was with the intention that Satan would do something for Him.
[17]  "Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your hand; only do not stretch forth your hand against him" v. 12a . We should not think that God was caught by Satan, for Satan was caught by God to do something for Him to strip Job for God.
[18]  In Job 1:12b-19 we see that Satan attacked Job and that Job suffered trials in the matter of his possessions and children.
[19]  Verses 20 through 22 describe Job's reaction to his trials.
[20]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE THREE THE TRIALS OF JOB 2 Scripture Reading: Job 2
[21]  In verses 7 and 8 we see that Satan attacked Job and that Job suffered the trial in his body.
[22]  In this situation God took a step to accomplish something with Job
[23]  A MYSTERIOUS AND GLORIOUS CONSUMMATION A. Satan's Attacks on Job
[24]  Satan's attacks on Job in two steps laid a mysterious and glorious foundation, or base, for God to accomplish His glorious transformation on Job and for Job to experience the mysterious transactions in his relationship with the mysterious God.
[25]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE FOUR JOB'S CURSING OF HIS BIRTHDAY Scripture Reading: Job 3
[26]  In chapter three Job cursed the day of his birth.
[27]  He was a good man and he was trying to keep his perfection, uprightness, and integrity, but due to his vexation he could not contain himself, and he did not know what to do.
[28]  GOD'S INTENTION WITH JOB A. To Consume the "Perfect and Upright" Job
[29]  God's stripping and consuming were exercised over Job to tear Job down that God might have a base and a way to rebuild him with God Himself that he might become a God-man.
[30]  Job blamed his friends for not showing kindness to him, who was fainting under the striking of God vv.
[31]  I. BILDAD BEING THE SECOND ONE TO REBUT JOB
[32]  In the first round of the debates between Job and his friends, the second one to rebut Job was Bildad, who complained that Job's speaking was too long, like a mighty wind 8:1-2 .
[33]  Bildad claimed that all the disasters and the plague on Job were not God's perverting of justice or the Almighty's perverting of righteousness v. 3 . Bildad implied that Job had condemned God, claiming that God had perverted justice concerning him.
[34]  C. Thinking That He Could Not Win His Case,
[35]  Job thought that he could not win his case, even though he was righteous and perfect vv.
[36]  15, 20-21 , because God is mighty and does not turn back His anger in His judgment vv.
[37]  In 13:4-19 Job accused his friends of being false.
[38]  The regenerated ones, who are divinely human and humanly divine, spontaneously become an organism, the Body of Christ, which is the church of God as the new man in God's new creation to carry out God's new "career," that is, to build up the Body of Christ for the fullness, the expression, of the Triune God.
[39]  This fullness as the organism of the Triune God will consummate in the New Jerusalem.
[40]  The Bible begins with God in His creation as the initiation and ends with the New Jerusalem, which is the mingling of the Triune God and all His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite people.
[41]  It was in this economy that Christ became incarnated, that He went to the cross to pass through crucifixion, that He came out from death and entered into resurrection, and that in resurrection He was begotten of God to be God's firstborn Son and as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit to regenerate all His believers to make them the same as He is in life and nature that they might become His brothers and the sons of God.
[42]  In this message I have the burden to say a word regarding God's answer to Job This answer addresses a crucial question raised by the book of Job
[43]  The New Testament is God's answer to Job We may say that it is a message "faxed" from God to Job This "fax," this answer, reveals that God was not judging Job or punishing him but was stripping and consuming him so that Job could be rebuilt with the Triune God.
[44]  The Lord Jesus lived on earth for more than thirty years.
[45]  In His ascension Christ poured out Himself as the consummated Triune God and as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His members, to constitute all of them into one organic Body to be the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[46]  The main contents of the New Testament are that the Triune God has an eternal economy according to His good pleasure to dispense Himself into His chosen and redeemed people in His life and in His nature, to make all of them the same as He is in life and nature, to make them His duplication that they may express Him.
[47]  After saying that no one could bring a clean thing from an unclean, Job continued, "Since his days are determined,/And the number of his months is with You;/Since You have appointed his bounds, and he cannot go beyond" v. 5 . Here Job was saying that God had appointed limits that Job could not go beyond.
[48]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE TWELVE GOD'S ETERNAL ECONOMY
[49]  AS THE ANSWER TO THE BOOK OF JOB Scripture Reading: Job 10:2, 8-9, 13; Eph 3:9
[50]  We have pointed out that the forty-two chapters of the book of Job leave us with a twofold question concerning the purpose of God in creating man and the purpose of God in dealing with His chosen people.
[51]  The fourth item is the life-dispensing resurrection of Christ, in which Christ in His humanity was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God to bring in many more sons after Him, in which the Triune God in humanity became the life-giving Spirit for the divine dispensing, and in which all the believers in Christ were regenerated to be sons of God and members of Christ.
[52]  Crying to the Earth Not to Cover His Blood
[53]  Job cried to the earth not to cover his blood and not to frustrate his crying out v. 18 . Then he said, "Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven,/And He who vouches for me is in the heights./My friends deride me;/My eye pours out tears to God,/That He would adjudicate for a man in his case with God/And for a son of man in his case with his neighbor" vv.
[54]  Job went on to say that God had walled up his way so that he could not pass and that He had put darkness upon his paths v. 8 . I do not believe that God did either of these things to Job Actually, it might have been Job himself who had walled up his way.
[55]  Job was gone dying , and his hope had been plucked up like a tree v. 10 . Job's hope had been to build up the "tree" of his integrity, but God would not allow such a tree to grow within Job Rather, God had plucked up this tree, this hope.
[56]  Although God was stripping Job, He surely was not angry with him; neither did God consider Job as His adversary but as His intimate friend.
[57]  Because Job was so hurt by what had happened to him and because he felt that God was treating him too severely, Job wished that his words would be engraved in rock as a permanent record of his suffering.
[58]  In Job 19:28 and 29 Job gave a warning to his friends.
[59]  Whereas some said that God stores up the punishment of the iniquity of the wicked for his children, Job said that God should recompense the wicked, so that he knows it v. 19 . Job continued by saying that the eyes of the wicked should see his destruction and that the wicked one should drink the wrath of the Almighty.
[60]  We have seen that the book of Job leaves us with a crucial twofold question concerning God's intention in His creation of man and in His dealing with His chosen people.
[61]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT AS THE CONSUMMATION
[62]  OF THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: Job 42:5; John 7:39; Rom 8:2, 9, 11, 14; Gal 3:14; 6:18; Eph 1:13-14; Phil 1:19; Gal 5:25; Rom 8:16, 4
[63]  We have seen that the divine revelation in the New Testament is the answer to the sufferings of Job and to the great question concerning God's intention in His creation of man and in His dealing with His chosen people.
[64]  In this message I would like to give a further word regarding this answer, focusing on the matter of the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[65]  Some teachers of the Bible claim that the Bible may be divided into three sections the Old Testament, the four Gospels, and the books from Acts through Revelation and that these sections correspond respectively to three ages the age of the Father, the age of the Son, and the age of the Spirit.
[66]  He was only divine but not human; He was only God but not man.
[67]  But one day the Triune God entered into the womb of a human virgin and after nine months was born out of that womb to be the God-man, a divine-human person, a person with both the divine nature and the human nature.
[68]  Although He did not accomplish anything great in a material sense, He did something marvelous He expressed God, He manifested God, in full, in His human living.
[69]  The book of Romans, after speaking of justification and of our being crucified and raised with Christ, unveils this Spirit as the Spirit of life 8:2 , the Spirit of God v. 9 , the indwelling Spirit v. 11 , and the leading Spirit v. 14 . This one Spirit is our God, our Father, our Lord, our Master, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Shepherd, and our big Brother.
[70]  However, Job said that God was of one mind and did what His soul desired, performing what had been appointed to Job Therefore, Job was terrified at His presence and was in dread of Him, feeling that God had made his heart faint and that the Almighty had terrified him vv.
[71]  In chapter twenty-four we see Job's knowledge concerning God in His dealings with all kinds of men.
[72]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE NINETEEN OUR UNIQUE NEED THE PROCESSED
[73]  The Triune God is now being wrought into us, not in His "raw" state but in His consummated state.
[74]  Job said that Sheol is naked before God, that He hangs the earth upon nothing, that He spread His cloud over the face of His throne, that by His power He stilled the sea and by His understanding He struck down Rahab a sea monster spoken of in ancient narratives , and that by His Spirit the heavens became beauty.
[75]  Matthew 5:8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[76]  Here, seeing God is a great reward in the kingdom.
[77]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO GOD'S MOVE IN CHRIST TO BRING FORTH THE BODY Scripture Reading: Phil 3:8; Col 1:24-29; 2:2; Eph 3:4; 1 Thes 5:17; Eph 6:18
[78]  In this message I have the burden to speak a word concerning God's move in Christ to bring forth the Body.
[79]  The substance, essence, element, and expression of this part of the Word are simply the processed, consummated Triune God as the all-inclusive, compound, indwelling Spirit who indwells us in our spirit to be our life, our nature, our essence, and our everything, that we may be the same as the Triune God in life and nature to be His fullness as His full expression in a corporate way.
[80]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE THIRD OF THE THREE ROUNDS IN THE DEBATES
[81]  of His Servant or Maid in His Fearing God
[82]  Job did not despise the cause of his servant or maid when they contended with him v. 13 . This means that he took care of their need.
[83]  Verses 14 and 15 indicate that in this matter also Job feared God: "What then will I do when God rises up?/And when He visits me, what will I answer Him?
[84]  Concerning this also Job feared God, saying, "Calamity from God is dreadful to me,/And because of His majesty I can do nothing" v. 23 . He was threatened by God's majesty, and he feared that if he did not do well, calamity would come upon him.
[85]  Job continued by saying that he did not cover his transgressions as Adam did nor hide his iniquity in his bosom because of the fear of the great multitude and because the contempt of the families frightened him vv.
[86]  Job's speaking indicates that he had not received the divine revelation, as unveiled in the New Testament concerning God's eternal economy, that God's ultimate goal, as God desires for His good pleasure, is that He may be gained, partaken of, possessed, and enjoyed by His chosen people that they may be consumed by God's dealing, renewed in the divine nature 2 Cor 4:16 , and transformed in the divine life by the Spirit to the glorious image of Christ 2 Cor 3:18 as the embodiment of God for God's expression.
[87]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR MAN MOVING IN GOD'S MOVE
[88]  In this message I would like to give a further word on God's move, in particular on man moving in God's move and God moving in man's move.
[89]  Elihu then declared that his words would manifest the uprightness of his heart and that his tongue would speak what he knew sincerely v. 3 . Saying that the Spirit of God had made him and that the breath of the Almighty had enlivened him, Elihu told Job, "If you can, respond to me;/Arrange your words before me; take your stand" v. 5 . Furthermore, Elihu said that no fear of him would terrify Job and that Elihu's pressure could not be heavy upon him v. 7 . This kind of talk was altogether unnecessary.
[90]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX ELIHU'S TURN TO SPEAK
[91]  CHAPTERS 32 37 2 ELIHU'S SECOND AND THIRD CORRECTIONS
[92]  Elihu went on to refute Job, saying that God would never do evil and that the Almighty would never commit iniquity v. 10 . Rather, God will render a man's work to him and will cause a man to receive that which is according to his own way v. 11 . In verses 12 through 20 Elihu spoke further concerning God's not doing evil and not perverting justice.
[93]  In verses 12 through 15 he declared, "Indeed in all certainty God will not do evil,/And the Almighty will not pervert justice./Who has ever put the earth in His charge?/Or who has ever set in order the whole world?/If He were to consider Himself only,/He would gather back to Himself His spirit and His breath;/All flesh would perish together,/And man would return to dust."
[94]  In verses 21 through 33 Elihu continued to refute Job, saying that God governs and judges the nations and men not to fit Job, since Job had rejected it.
[95]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN A PERSON IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rev 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10
[96]  The speaking of Job, of his three friends, and of Elihu was altogether lacking in the exercise of the spirit to contact God.
[97]  They did not pray, and they did not have fellowship with God or with one another in spirit.
[98]  Many readers of Revelation fail to see that the seer of the visions in this book was one who was doing nothing but remaining in the human spirit.
[99]  CHAPTERS 32 37 3 ELIHU'S FINAL WORD TO JOB Scripture Reading: Job 36 37
[100]  In this message we will consider chapters thirty-six and thirty-seven, which are Elihu's final word to Job Once again, there was no prayer or exercise of the spirit in fellowship.
[101]  Next, Elihu warned Job that he was filled with the judgment of the wicked, telling him that judgment and justice had taken hold of him v. 17 . Here Elihu seemed to be saying that Job was not enjoying a table full of fatness because he was occupied with the judgment of the wicked, continually thinking that God should exercise His judgment upon the wicked, with justice being the verdict of judgment.
[102]  Finally, in his last word to Job, Elihu instructed Job to fear God, who does not look upon any who are wise of heart v. 24 .
[103]  Concerning the purpose of God in dealing with Job, even in the highlight of his final word to Job, Elihu did not have the capacity to afford Job a divine revelation that is up to the New Testament level, namely, that God's purpose in allowing the believers to suffer the loss of all things is that they may gain God as their eternal portion for them to inherit and enjoy as the eternal life unto eternity, as the Lord revealed to His disciples in Matthew 19:27-29.
[104]  WITH THE DIVINE UNVEILINGS Scripture Reading: Job 38 41
[105]  Chapters thirty-eight through forty-one, which we will consider in this message, cover God's appearing to Job with the divine unveilings.
[106]  In 40:2 Jehovah said to Job, "Shall one who finds fault contend with the Almighty?/Let him who argues with God answer it."
[107]  Jehovah charged Job to deck himself with majesty and excellency and to array himself with honor and splendor v. 10 . Furthermore, God charged Job to pour forth the overflowings of his anger and to look upon everyone who is proud and to bring him down, to hide them in the dust together, and to bind their faces in the hidden place.
[108]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE THIRTY THE FINAL OUTCOME, UNDER GOD'S CONSUMMATION,
[109]  IN THE NARRATION OF THE STORY OF JOB Scripture Reading: Job 42
[110]  In this message we will consider chapter forty-two of the book of Job This chapter reveals the final outcome, under God's consummation, of the progressive divine revelation in the narration of the story of Job
[111]  This indicates that Job gained God in his personal experience in addition to knowing God in his vain knowledge by tradition and that he abhorred himself.
[112]  Job 42:7 tells us that God condemned Job's three friends for not speaking concerning Him that which was right, as His servant Job had.
[113]  In His reply to Job, God paid no attention to Elihu because his concept had not come up to the level of God's ultimate standard, though it was not wrong.
[114]  In this message I would like to speak a further word concerning God's intention in His appearing to Job
[115]  When God asked Job so many questions concerning the universe 38:4-38 and concerning the animals 38:39 39:30 , His intention was to enable Job to see that he, a person who remained in himself, was considering things regarding the universe and God that were far beyond his capacity.
[116]  Job was in the realm of building up something that was wrong.
[117]  They may think that being a Christian is simply a matter of believing that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is our Savior, who shed His blood for our sins and who has saved us through His death; that the Holy Spirit is now with us to help us to behave ourselves well and to do good that God may be glorified; and that we will go to heaven when we die.
[118]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO THE COMPLETED DIVINE REVELATION
[119]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE THE CENTRAL POINT OF GOD'S APPEARING TO JOB Scripture Reading: Job 42:1-6; 40:10-14; Col 2:2b; Eph 3:4
[120]  As we study the book of Job, we need to realize that to understand this book, we need the entire Bible.
[121]  The Lord Jesus said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" v. 3 . Not understanding this, Nicodemus replied, "How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?" v. 4 . What a terrible misunderstanding! The Lord Jesus went on to speak to Nicodemus about being born of water and the Spirit, telling him that "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" v. 6 . Nicodemus then asked, "How can these things be?" v. 9 . Eventually, the Lord Jesus said to him, "If I told you of the things on earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you of the things in heaven?" v. 12 . Regeneration, being born anew, concerns the divine life, yet it takes place on earth.
[122]  In John 16 the Lord told His disciples that although He had yet many things to say to them, at that time they could not bear them v. 12 . Later, after Christ had passed through death and had entered into resurrection to become the firstborn Son of God and the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of reality would come to guide the disciples into all the reality v. 13 . On the evening of the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus appeared to them, and "He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit" 20:22 . However, not even at that time was the divine revelation given in full.
[123]  Instead of speaking to Job regarding these things that were on His heart, God asked him about other things, including himself.
[124]  God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ 1 Pet 1:3 , and now He renews us, transforms us, and conforms us to His image of glory, and ultimately He will glorify us in His glory Titus 3:5; Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23; 2 Cor 4:16; 3:18; Rom 8:29-30 .
[125]  In His renewing and transforming, God consumes us, putting us into Christ's death for our fellowship of His sufferings, which work out for us an eternal weight of glory, that we may experience Him in His resurrection and gain Him in His unsearchable riches 2 Cor 4:16-17, 10; Phil 3:10, 8; Eph 3:8 .
[126]  As people chosen by God, we, the descendants of Abraham, the race chosen by God, need to receive and answer God's call Gen 12:1-4 , to live before God through Christ as our burnt offering v. 7; 13:18; 22:13 , to be exposed by the law that we might know that we are sinful and do not have the capacity to keep the law Exo 19:8, 21 20:21 , and to live with God by taking Christ as the tabernacle, the priest, and the offerings that we may enter into God and enjoy all that God is with Christ and in Christ Exo 25 Lev 27 .
[127]  The ones who have been chosen and called by God need to believe into Jesus Christ, who is the incarnated God, who died, resurrected, and ascended for us and with us, and who became the life-giving Spirit as the pneumatic Christ to us, that He may be our salvation, life, and everything.
[128]  As believers in Christ, we need to grow in the divine life of Christ that we may be transformed into what Christ is through the life-dispensing Spirit, that we may be built up with the saints to be the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God in Christ, and to be the new man as God's new creation to carry out God's eternal economy in the consummation of the New Jerusalem as the mingling of the processed Triune God with the glorified tripartite man, to be the corporate God-man's manifestation in eternity.
[129]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX THE SIGNIFICANCE IN THE SEQUENCE
[130]  OF JOB AND THE PSALMS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; 1 Pet 2:2; 2 Pet 3:18; Eph 4:13
[131]  Since the book of Psalms shows progress beyond the book of Job concerning the divine revelation and concerning our seeking after God, it would not be fitting for the Psalms to come before Job Spiritually speaking, it is significant that, in the sequence of books in the Scriptures, the Psalms comes after Job
[132]  That They May Have More Room in Their Spirit
[133]  In addition, the book of Job functions to empty the Bible readers' spirit that they may have more room in their spirit to gain God in His riches more and more, to gain God more than anything else.
[134]  Some readers of Job know about his patience and endurance James 5:10-11 and about the material blessing Job received at the end, but they do not know either what it means to see God or what God's intention was in His appearing to Job Regarding God's dealing with Job, there were certain mysterious things, and these things are to some extent unveiled in the Psalms.
[135]  LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN TWO TREES, TWO SOURCES, TWO LINES,
[136]  B. The Two Trees Being the Two Most Striking
[137]  The genuine good is God Himself Matt 19:17a ; hence, gaining God equals gaining the genuine good.
[138]  The first way is the way of life, the constricted way Matt 7:14 , the Way Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22 , the straight way 2 Pet 2:15 , the way of righteousness 2 Pet 2:21 , the way of salvation Acts 16:17 , the way of God Matt 22:16; Acts 18:26 , and the way of the Lord Acts 18:25 , for men to seek God, to gain God, and to enjoy God in His eternal life as the supply and unto His eternal life as the goal, that they may be born of God in His life and nature John 1:12-13 , transformed and conformed into His glorious image 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 8:29 , and glorified in Him as glory Rom 8:30; 1 Pet 5:10a; Heb 2:10a to gain Him and participate in Him to the fullest extent.
[139]  TWO PRINCIPLES A. The Two Ways Constituting the Two Principles
[140]  The two ways, the way of life and the way of death and of good and evil, constitute the two controlling, ruling, and regulating principles by which men have their relationship with God.
[141]  The two ends are the two destinations of the two ways men take in their relationship with God.
[142]  The destination of God's way of life is a city of water of life, the New Jerusalem, God's eternal dwelling Rev 21:2, 11, 23; 22:1-2, 14 , as the best and most glorious goal for all the men who walk in the way of life according to God's desire and for God's pleasure, that they may participate with God in all the blessings of God as the eternal life for eternity.
[143]  AN ADDITIONAL MESSAGE THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:10; 3:8-10; 1 Tim 1:4; Gal 1:15-16; Col 3:4a; John 12:24; 19:34; Rom 5:10; John 3:3, 5-6; Titus 3:5; 1 Pet 2:2; Eph 4:12-13; 1 Cor 14:3; Eph 4:15-16; Rom 8:2; 1 Cor 15:45b; Phil 1:19b; 1 Cor 12:13b; John 7:37-39; Gal 5:16, 25
[144]  Based on His redemption, God has to save us by the life of Christ.
