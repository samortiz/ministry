In helping people to know that they are saved, we must begin with God's choosing before the foundation of the world
You must not think that your salvation is a coincidence or that you took the initiative to believe in the Lord
When we select an object, after we have picked it out, we may put a mark on it; this is to 'mark out' the object
A student who heard Moodys teaching on predestination in class was impressed and did not dare to preach the gospel because he had a problem
Once a person passes through the entrance and looks back, he will see written on the inside, 'You have been predestinated'
When leading those who have passed through the entrance and have been baptized, we should say, 'You have been predestinated by God
We need to let all the new believers know that they were saved unto the Lord because they received God's calling
We were evil filthy and full of transgressions Gods condemnation was upon us and there was no way for the record of our sins to be annulled
The Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross, satisfying the righteous requirement of the law and paying that price for us
As soon as the blood was sprinkled upon us, we were delivered from the law and freed from the condemnation of the law
Peter 1:19 says that we were redeemed 'with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ'
All the sins that we committed before God are forgiven and dealt with once and for all, and we are no longer condemned
If we could use a chemical solution to completely remove this record from the account book, there would no longer be any trace of the record
A person who has been called by God, sprinkled with the blood, redeemed, forgiven, and washed has spontaneously been separated unto God
Corinthians 611 12 and Romans 17 show that once a person is saved God separates him unto Himself he belongs to God and is thereby sanctified
We were once the descendants of Adam, the people of the world; we were in a crowd of sinners and were for the world and sin
When 1 Corinthians 6:11 speaks of being sanctified and justified, the sequence is that we are washed, sanctified, and justified
Unless a person is sprinkled with the blood, redeemed, forgiven, washed, and sanctified by God, God has no way to justify him
Colossians 1:20-22 shows that we, God's enemies, have been reconciled to God by the blood the Lord Jesus shed on the cross
Romans 5:9-11 says that since we have been justified because of the Lord Jesus, we are also reconciled to God because of Him, or through Him
For a person to exist, he needs to put on clothes in order to look proper and he needs to eat in order to survive
He now looked proper, matching the condition of the father's house; consequently, he could enter the father's house
After he entered the father's house, the father said, 'Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry'
God's salvation must go one step further so that we can receive His life within, so that we can be regenerated
Peter 1:3 says that God has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
If God only cleanses us outwardly without regenerating us inwardly, His salvation would be like the work of a mortician
In His salvation God not only wants to cleanse us, to take away our sins; He also wants to regenerate us, to make us alive
Because we were dead in our sins, we needed God's forgiveness and God's regeneration in order that we may be made alive
We can walk, grow, act, and serve God on the basis of having the life of God and being regenerated and made alive
Ephesians 2:5 says that God 'made us alive together with Christ,' and verse 6 says that God 'raised us up together with Him,' Christ
God's salvation is to save us to the extent that we are not only made alive but are resurrected, raised up, and able to act and live
Ephesians 2:6 says, 'Raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus'
We have ascended and are sitting in the heavenlies because the Lord who is sitting in the heavenlies has been connected to us
It is not that we have ascended and are now sitting in the heavenlies; rather, we have ascended and are sitting in the heavenlies in Christ
In the past we were blind, but now we are saved, and our eyes have been opened and illuminated so that we can see
Within the new creation there is the element of God because the new creation comes from the union and mingling of God with the created ones
Everyone who receives the Lord Jesus is not only saved; he also receives authority from the Lord, and this authority is of life
We have received a life from the Lord, and this life becomes the authority for us to become the children of God
John 3:1 says, 'Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are'
As those who have been saved and have become the children of God, we have received all that God is and all that God has as our inheritance
We have not only escaped His judgment and condemnation, but we have also received God Himself and all that God has as our inheritance
The result of our bringing people to salvation may also be the same as sending them to a 'child-care center' or to an 'orphanage'
If they had a home in reality, when the child was born, he would be born into a home and spontaneously become a member of a family
After we are saved, we become citizens in God's kingdom; hence, we are heavenly, particular, and different from others
In the household we enjoy the Fathers care and provision but in the kingdom we are under the Lords ruling and are subject to His authority
Brothers and sisters, have we considered that as citizens in God's kingdom we are actually being trained to be kings?
Have we ever thought that as believers, we are citizens of God's kingdom for the purpose of being trained to reign for God?
In a broad sense, all things in the universe belong to God, but God does not consider them as His treasure and His inheritance
Even though we are still in the old creation, Ephesians 1:13 says that as God's inheritance we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit
Once we have bought them, we need to put our seal on the items because we have not taken them from the factory
Once a person is saved, he is not only begotten of God, having God's life; he is also God's dwelling place, God's resting place
In the New Testament a spiritual priest is the spiritual temple because the priest and the temple are the same
Once we are saved and have the life of Christ, we are a part of Christ, just as our hands and feet are our members and a part of us
We praise the Lord that once we are saved, we enter into a high status of being a part of Christ and being indispensable to Christ
She explained that the Lord Jesus' hand was big and powerful, and that, being in His hand, she could not be snatched out by anyone
In relation to God, we are priests to serve Him, and in relation to Christ, we are members with a function to express Him
A child in a Chinese family will learn to speak Chinese, and a child in a Japanese family will learn to speak Japanese
As a result, they will speak different languages and their functions and skills will differ, even though their life and growth are the same
In order for a member to manifest his function, he must have inner growth by the Holy Spirit and outward exercise
It is regrettable that some people repudiate and condemn outward exercise and put too much emphasis on the inward growth in life
Even the most educated person in the world does not know whom he belongs to, but we know that we belong to God
In the same way, since we belong to God and are under His sovereign right, He eternally bears full responsibility for us
Even if we want to stay away from God, because we are His possessions and He is our Lord, He will never let us go
Whenever we taste the heavenly flavor and touch the heavenly reality, we feel very comfortable, sweet, and happy
In preaching the gospel, we often say that if man does not have God, he feels empty, but if man has God, he no longer feels empty
The Lord Jesus came to be our Savior and that the Holy Spirit entered into us in order to bring God into us so that He may abide in us
In John 14:16-17 the Lord Jesus said that when the Holy Spirit comes, He will be with us forever and shall be in us
Regardless of how dead, dry, down, or bored we may feel, the Holy Spirit in us is living, fresh, and uplifting
We should not look at ourselves, but instead, we should believe in, pay attention to, and follow the Holy Spirit within
We often speak of 'the life of God,' and people may understand this to mean the life in God coming out to become our life
As the Father, the indwelling Triune God is great; as Christ, powerful; and as the Holy Spirit, full of vitality and living
Concerning this point, we are not afraid of speaking too strongly or too much, for the more we stress this point, the better
We must impress new believers that the Triune God within them is glorious and great; He is very great, very strong, and very living
He is great because He is God, He is strong because He is Christ, and He is living because He is the Holy Spirit
The emphasis on life is on the capacity to live, and the emphasis on nature is on the inclination of our living
We feel uneasy when we are proud and comfortable when we are humble because this is the nature and inclination of God
We feel uneasy when we take advantage of others and very happy when we share with others because this is God's nature and inclination
The life of God within us is the capacity to live, and the nature of God within us has become the inclination of our living
We have a spontaneous ability to stay away from wrong and draw near to what is right to choose what is of God and forsake what is not of God
Every believer not only has God's life, nature, and the law of life within him; he also has the continuous operating of the anointing
The law in us spontaneously regulates and empowers, and the anointing constantly enables us to know how God is leading and teaching us
We have seven items in us-God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, life, nature, the law of life, and the anointing, but these seven items are just one
As a result of the eight 'beings,' three 'belongings,' and seven 'havings,' we are in Christ as soon as we are saved
A thorough knowledge of the thirty-eight points in this and the previous lesson form a firm foundation for our salvation
Now that he is saved, he should terminate the things of the past because he is a new person, having the life of the new creation
Whether one is ready to be baptized or has already been baptized, he should know that baptism is a termination
If a person does not terminate his past after he is saved, he will be unable to advance as he should as a Christian
On the one hand, he wants to be a Christian, and on the other hand, he still lives the life of the old creation
When we were in northern China, some in the Pentecostal movement were always promoting such an open confession
There is no portion in the Bible that teaches a person to search through all the things of his past after he repents and is saved
Before hearing John's preaching on repentance, they had taken things from others by false accusation and had cheated others
In order to obtain God's forgiveness, we do not need to search our past and deal with each item in a thorough way
A believer who desires to witness for the Lord and to walk the way of the Lord in a pure manner must fully terminate the things of his past
He will not lose his salvation if he does not close the casino, but there will be no way for him to be a proper Christian
When a person wearing such clothing is saved, God forgives her for the way she dressed in the past, and the matter is over
If we desire to walk on the right path and to bear a proper testimony, we must terminate the things of our past life
If we want to follow the Lord properly and bear witness for Him, we must terminate our former manner of living
In order to follow the Lord and bear witness for the Lord, we need to conclude our past, but we do not need to search through our past
All the actions of a person who is saved by grace depend upon the moving of the Holy Spirit, not on regulations
There is no explicit teaching in the Bible regarding how a person should terminate the past after he repents and is saved
In 1 Thessalonians 1:9 Paul said that when the Thessalonians believed in the Lord, they turned away from idols
Once a person is saved, he should completely remove idolatrous things from his life without waiting to be baptized
It may not be necessary to act immediately in regard to other matters, but we should be quick to terminate things related to idols
If we feel that we do not have the strength, we can ask a few brothers to pray with us for our strengthening and encouragement
Some Chinese practice reading facial features, some practice fortune telling, others use horoscopes, and still others practice divination
There should no longer be any idols or items pertaining to superstition in a believer's home, especially after he is baptized
The presence of idols may cause another new believer to be confused and in darkness concerning spiritual matters
The Catholic Church teaches that we should physically worship a visible image rather than use our spirit to worship the invisible God
We have used this example as a basis for helping others to have a burning of demonic, filthy, and improper things
New believers should follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to remove any such demonic and filthy thing from their lives and their homes
Every household willingly brought their mah-jongg sets, which were of the best quality, and put them in a huge pile
Some brothers suggested that we sell the mah-jongg sets because they were so nice and expensive, saying that it would be a pity to burn them
The Holy Spirit will inwardly speak to people about the need to burn some of their clothing, even if it is expensive
In Acts 19:19 the Bible specifically states the value of the things burned, showing that the believers in those days burned expensive items
Fifty thousand pieces of silver in those days is considerably more than fifty thousand dollars today, but all these were still burned
It may not be necessary to restore four times as much; perhaps slightly more than the original amount is enough
It may be difficult for the conscience of a new believer to set an amount to repay, whether the exact amount, double the amount, or more
We should not simply consider the peace in our conscience and our innocence before the Lord without considering others
Some people have caused discord between husbands and wives and even caused family disputes in dealing with these matters
We need to be wise and deal with this matter appropriately so that those whom we owe are compensated without causing others to suffer
After we are saved, we should turn to the Lord to see whether any person, thing, or matter in our living should remain the same
Terminating and dealing with these items is a matter of following the moving of the Holy Spirit, not of following any regulation or doctrine
The Holy Spirit will not only renew our mind, perception, emotion, and will but also renew everything in our outward living
Our responsibility is to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and let the Holy Spirit gain ground in us through His moving
Satan immediately comes again and says that we should have repaid three or even four times the original amount
Every person should enter through the gate of consecration as soon as he is saved in order to walk the way of consecration
In chapter 13 God required the children of Israel to sanctify their firstborn unto Him because they were saved through the passover
A believer who wants to walk the way of the Lord, grow in life, and allow God to work thoroughly in him needs to offer himself to God
Our emotion must be handed over to the Lord, our mind must be touched by the Lord, and our will must surrender to Him
There are also those who have been saved for many years but who have little growth in life; rather, they seem to be withered and old
The manifestation of the law of life and the growth of the sense of life enable the life in us to grow gradually
If we have never offered ourselves to the Lord, we have no way to enjoy the Triune God even though He dwells in us
Although the Lord's victory is our portion, we will remain in our failures if we do not offer ourselves to Him
The Lord has received authority over all things in heaven and on earth, and this authority has also been given to us
If we do not give ourselves to the Lord and stand together with Him, we will have His authority in position but not in experience or reality
Everything that the Lord accomplished for us is ours; however, in order to experience them, we must be consecrated
Throughout the ages those who have spoken concerning spiritual experience paid much attention to the matter of consecration
In The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life, Hannah Whitall Smith said that if a believer wants to lead a happy life, he must be consecrated
George Muller, who spoke concerning faith, said that if one wants to have a living faith, he must consecrate himself to the Lord
If we do not enter through this gate, we will remain outside; we will be unable to see and partake of the rich contents inside
It would be difficult for any Christian who meditates on this love not to be touched or constrained by this great love of the Lord
Romans 12:1 says, 'I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice'
Since the Lord has purchased us, He has authority over us and we belong to Him, just as we own whatever we pay for
Although God has purchased us, He can be prevented from enjoying His right over us if we disagree with His use of us
Our consent to God's authority over us is because of His constraining love and because of the price He paid to purchase us
Although our consecration to the Lord is for Him to use us to satisfy His wishes, we must first become a sacrifice before we can be for God
Formerly, a lamb or bull was used by people in the world, but once it is placed on the altar, it can no longer be used by them
An offering that is presented as a sacrifice experiences not only a change in position but also a change in use
Consecration is not merely a matter of uttering a few sentences of prayer; consecration is to present oneself as a sacrifice
Everything that is presented as a sacrifice must pass through the process of Gods dealings especially if it is presented as a burnt offering
A sacrifice that is burnt to ashes has been thoroughly dealt with; even if there are further dealings, it will remain a heap of ashes
It is a pity that many Christians are 'willing' to consecrate themselves to God but are unwilling to be dealt with by Him
They are like bulls or lambs that have not been slaughtered, flayed, cut into pieces, washed, or consumed by fire
Only after we have been dealt with by God in this way can our work be in resurrection and a sweet savor unto Him
Although entering through the gate is once and for all, walking on the path requires a continual renewing, a daily consecration
The Israelites had to present burnt offerings on every Sabbath, at the beginning of every month, and during every feast
Once we acknowledge our consecration in this way, we will be clear whether we should go to see the movie or not
We should not be concerned with whether God will accept our sacrifice but only with whether we are consecrated
Even if our consecration is not completely sincere, it will eventually become real; a partial consecration will become a full consecration
After ten or twenty years God still called them back to the ground of the consecration they made in their youth
A consecrated person who has fallen and failed is different from an unconsecrated person who has fallen and failed
After we enter through the gate of consecration we need to walk on the path of consecration renewing our consecration daily and continually
Once we consecrate ourselves, we need to believe that our consecration has been accepted by God and can neither be revoked nor altered
Most people divide man into two parts: an outward part, which is the body, and an inward part, which is the 'spirit-soul'
Thoughts and considerations, joy and anger, preferences and decisions are all matters related to the soul, not the spirit
At that moment, in the deepest part of his being there may be some resistance, disagreeing with the action and disapproving of it
The feeling of resistance, however, which comes from his deepest part, is not based on any reason; hence, it is intuition
They also say that we need to act according to the conscience, which means acting according to the feeling of the conscience
The feeling of the conscience is often contrary to the mind's reasonings, to the emotion's likes and dislikes, and to the will's decisions
The reason the conscience is most commonly associated with the spirit is that it is a major part of the spirit
Consequently, sinners do not like to contact God and cannot contact God because their organ for contacting God has been damaged
The capacity of our human spirit to contact God was damaged, and the function of our spirit was therefore lost because of sin
They taught that a man's bright virtue needs to be cultivated and that his innate knowledge and ability need to be developed
After the Holy Spirit touched, enlightened, and condemned us, we condemned ourselves, and the conscience began to function properly
If salvation is only a matter of man's position before God, there could be no change in the life and living of a believer
The conscience of unbelievers is dead, but our conscience is living; the conscience of unbelievers is old, but our conscience is renewed
When we were saved, the Holy Spirit brought the life of God and God Himself into our spirit so that our spirit was made alive and renewed
For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit
The spirit in these three verses is not simply the Holy Spirit but the spirit that is mingled with the Spirit as one spirit
As Christians, we should not walk according to the flesh but walk according to the spirit, that is, the mingled spirit
The Chinese Union Version uses Holy Spirit in both verses, but it should simply be the Spirit, which is the mingled spirit
Whether we should do a certain thing, go to a certain place, or contact a certain person should all be according to the sense in our spirit
If someone asks us whether he can go to a movie or wear certain clothing, we should direct him to his sense within
Our living and walk as Christians are not according to the teachings we hear in sermons or the opinions and suggestions of other people
We should reject not only our flesh and lust but also the common, traditional teachings and general concepts of Christianity
We should put aside all of man's views, ideas, and opinions and turn to our deepest part to walk according to the sense of our spirit
Whenever we follow our flesh, indulge our lust, or live according to our preference, we are defeated Christians
Sometimes it is from the conscience, but most of the time it is from the intuition, a sense that comes directly from the spirit
From the day of our salvation, the Holy Spirit lives in our spirit and is mingled with our spirit as one spirit
The sense given to us in the operation of the Holy Spirit often seems like it is our feeling, because this function comes out of our spirit
When the Bible speaks of the work of the Holy Spirit within the human spirit, it speaks of operation and anointing
If we ignore His operation during the night, He will still anoint us in the morning, because He continually operates within us
When they pray, they anticipate something extraordinary, thinking that the moving of the Holy Spirit will rush upon them
Whenever there is a sense in our deepest part, in principle, we should pay attention to it and take care of it
To obey God is not merely to walk according to the letter of the Bible nor according to the teachings in the Bible
In principle, a Christian's living, walk, motives, thoughts, speaking, and attitude must absolutely follow the sense in our spirit
If, however, we do not follow the sense in our spirit and insist on watching the movie, we will lose our sense of peace
Because she has already designated the money in her pocket as an offering to the Lord, there is a struggle within her
After fellowshipping with a sister she may have a sense to sell the fabric and offer the proceeds to the Lord according to the original plan
If we want to watch a movie but have no sense to do so, we will feel satisfied, strong, and full of light if we follow this feeling
If we disobey this feeling and go to the movie, we will feel empty, dissatisfied, weak, and full of darkness within
The issue of not obeying the sense in our spirit is emptiness, weakness, darkness, uneasiness, and restlessness
We do not need to determine to be humble, to obey our parents, and to love others; all these determinations are futile
Even if we succeed according to our determination, God will not approve of our success because it is not God living out of us
To be a Christian does not require anything except that one learns to turn to the spirit and walk according to the feeling of the spirit
Day by day he needs to take heed to the inward feeling, and in everything he does, he needs to obey the feeling of the spirit
If we obey the feeling of our spirit in this way, we will not need to make up our mind to be humble; we will spontaneously be humble
Although these commandments are in the New Testament, we need to realize that they are for man to live out in Christ and in the Holy Spirit
When a person is willing to walk according to the spirit, he will overcome sin, the flesh, the world, and Satan
If we walk according to the spirit, we will spontaneously overcome sin, the flesh, the world, and Satan with no effort
Those who constantly focus on how to overcome sin and the world will easily fall into sin and are bound and entangled by the world
If we walk according to the spirit, we will overcome sin, the flesh, the world, and Satan; we will be filled with life and peace inwardly
In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
We read the Bible to be enlightened by God and to receive His revelation so that we may understand His intention and purpose toward us
We also obtain revelation in the light in order that we may know God's intention, our own condition, and how we should live and walk
We know that the Bible is the word of God, containing life that surpasses knowledge and containing light that surpasses doctrine
The proper attitude is to regard the Bible as a treasure store of the bread of life from which we draw the bread of life and are supplied
Those who read the Bible must realize what the Word of God is and have a proper attitude toward the Word of God
If we are well prepared with regard to these two points, it will be much easier for us to read the Bible in a proper way
We will immediately be on the proper path to touch life, to come to the light, and to fellowship with God in life and light
In other words, we will contact God, and in Him and through His Word, receive the life supply and the revelation in light
There are many ways to read the Bible that either require too much time or are too demanding for new believers
Some suggest reading one chapter of the New Testament in the morning and three chapters of the Old Testament during the second time
Our experience tells us that it may be more beneficial to read one chapter of the Old Testament each day and finish it in three years
It is sufficient for a new believer to read half a chapter of the New Testament and no more than one chapter of the Old Testament daily
In this way it will take three years to finish reading the Old Testament and two years to finish reading the New Testament
In this way we will no longer be aware of whether we are reading the Word or praying because our reading and praying have become one
We should turn this feeling into prayer, saying, 'Lord, the condition of my inner being is waste, empty, and dark
Verse 1 is also very precious and is worth memorizing: 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
We should underline all the important verses in the Bible that are related to the Lord Jesus and His redemption in red
We would be remarkable people if we could identify all of these seven items the first time we read through the Bible
Mere underlining without prayer, reading, or pray-reading will simply be an exercise in underlining and not a reading of the Bible
There will be some understanding because even though we do not know who Abraham is, we will know that Abraham begot a son named Isaac
Regardless of how experienced and how thorough we are, it is impossible to understand everything in reading the Bible
We should read according to our level, receive as much as we can understand, and let go of the things that we cannot understand
At this moment, we may spontaneously muse on the fact that since the Lord Jesus was born of a woman, He must be this seed of a woman
In comparing Christ, who was born of the woman in Galatians 4 with the seed of the woman in Genesis 3, there will surely be some light
We can do this kind of recalling, musing, and comparing during our free time apart from the time allocated for reading the Bible
We have considered them and have practiced some of them but our experience shows that the ways presented in these books should be simplified
The manna had to be gathered in the morning before the sun appeared, because once the sun appeared the manna would melt away
When we come to the Bible every morning to gather manna, we are actually seeking to touch the Lord and to receive Him as our bread of life
Apart from reading the New Testament every morning, we should also find another time during the day to read the Old Testament
If possible, we should spend at least twenty minutes to read the Bible, and it is better to spend even more time
We may even spend a few weeks to study the Bible in the morning, in the afternoon, and again in the evening when on vacation
The Lord's blood redeemed us from our sins before God, satisfied the righteous requirement of God, and speaks something better for us
In the parting words of the Lord in John 14 through 16, the Lord said that if we ask anything in His name, He will do it
If there is condemnation or offense in our conscience, our spirit will collapse, and we will be unable to pray
In order to pray without hindrance, we must deal with our conscience so that it is void of offense and without condemnation
The only way we can have a conscience that is void of offense is by the cleansing of the precious blood of Jesus
If we know how to pray, we will never neglect dealing with our sins by confessing when we come before God in prayer
The Bible also says that the Canaanite woman cried out to the Lord, saying, 'Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David'!
The woman immediately changed her utterance and said Yes Lord for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table
She used expressions such as little dogs, crumbs, and fall from their masters' table to force the Lord Jesus to respond to her need
She used the expression little dogs, which came out of the Lord's mouth, and placed herself in the position of a dog
We need to be trained to the point that whether we are talking to others or riding a bus or a bicycle, we still can pray within
If we overestimate ourselves and try to move all five at once, we will be unable to move them and may even drop them
We need to exercise to the extent that once we kneel down before God, our whole being is calm and able to wait for His instructions
When we sense that the burden within has been discharged, and there is no further problem in the matter of our request, we should believe
We should pray until the burden has been lifted and is no longer with us, until we have peace within and no longer feel the need to pray
We not only thank him when he has accomplished the task, but we even thank him when he merely agrees to do the task
We should not wait until our prayer is fulfilled to give thanks; we should begin giving thanks even before it is fulfilled
The emphasis in giving thanks is to thank God for His grace, and the emphasis in praising is to praise God for His acts
With respect to the grace of God, we need to give thanks, and with respect to the acts of God, we need to offer praises
Whether our prayer is heard and fulfilled or has not yet been fulfilled, we touch God and gain knowledge of Him through prayer
Sometimes things are fulfilled as soon as we pray, but other matters require prayer over a long period of time
Good Bible reading needs to be complemented with prayer, and good prayer needs to be complemented with Bible reading
To have a proper spiritual exercise, we need to set a time to rise up in the morning, a time to read the Bible, and a time to pray
Since our heart and spirit are not yet distracted or troubled by many things in the morning, they are able to be quiet before God
It is best if every brother and sister would spend some time praying with others, apart from their own individual prayer time
Just as fish need to live in water and birds need to live in the air, Christians need to maintain their life by meeting
Brothers and sisters, once we are saved, we are a person in the church, and we cannot be individual Christians
Although we cannot say that meeting alone constitutes the church, we can say that the church is in the meetings
According to the personal aspect, we can receive grace when we read the Bible, pray, seek after God, and contact God
We must also realize that the personal aspect of grace is not as weighty even though it is practical and necessary
There are some spiritual matters for which the personal aspect of grace is insufficient; hence, they must be brought to the meeting
If they would be willing to bring that weakness to the meeting and ask others to pray with them, they will easily overcome it
The Lord also charged them, saying, 'Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you retain, they are retained'
Such an appearing in which the disciples received the Holy Spirit and were commissioned was not experienced individually
If he had been absent from the second evening, he would have suffered a loss that could never have been regained
These examples show that if we want the Lord's presence, the Holy Spirit's outpouring, and the Lord's blessing, we must meet together
Grace in the personal aspect can be obtained in private, but grace in the corporate aspect can be obtained only in the meetings
The loss suffered by neglecting the corporate aspect is greater than the loss suffered by neglecting the personal aspect
Rarely can Christians who only have a personal aspect and not a corporate aspect continue to stand firm before the Lord
It seems that those who are somewhat loose on the personal side but who continue to meet can still be sustained before the Lord
Christians should not only meet often but should also meet to the extent that meetings become a habit, and thus, a meeting life is produced
A Christian who develops a habit of not meeting is in a dangerous state and will certainly be unable to stand firm
In the previous lesson we covered the importance of meeting, the benefit of meeting, and the result of not meeting
When we consider the condition of our meetings, we realize that thirty years ago we were like children playing
Although the Lord's mercy was upon us in our childishness and brought us through, we wasted some of our time and energy
In addition, we need to carefully consider the techniques of meeting, which are definitely related to ushering in spiritual blessing
Some may have learned music in school and, therefore, have some knowledge concerning singing; this is convenient
Sometimes the singing is so fast that it is difficult for people to keep up; at other times it is so slow that it puts people to sleep
In the meeting we also need to give thanks to God for His grace and for the works of grace He accomplished for us
Whereas the objects of our praise are God's doings and His virtues, the objects of our thanksgiving are God's grace and His works of grace
In particular this applies to the bread-breaking meeting; the brothers and sisters should exercise to be calm and consider the Lord Himself
Giving thanks to the Lord, reading a few verses from the Scriptures, or speaking a few words may release and refresh others' stale spirit
Whether we speak a few words, offer a prayer, or share a testimony, we should minister Christ and the divine life to others
Whether we give a message, read a portion from the Bible with some speaking, or share a testimony, others should be enlightened
We may not know how to deal with our conscience, but through a testimony we are enlightened and learn how to deal with our conscience
It is a pity that some brothers and sisters who love the Lord, are zealous, and pursue the Lord are not clear concerning these truths
It is not easy to find the universal church in the Bible, but the local churches can be found in many portions of the Scriptures
There is the church in Jerusalem , the church in Antioch , the church in Ephesus , the church in Smyrna , and the churches in Asia Minor
We acknowledge that the Body of Christ is universal, but the churches we contact on the earth today are local churches
The Bible also clearly presents matters such as Christian conduct, marriage, family, management of finances, and occupations
Whereas the positive side of Christian meetings is to receive grace, the negative side is to put Satan to shame
Another sister may testify of how she was saved from worshipping the devil and how hearing the gospel she went home and burned all her idols
We do not meet merely to attend a so-called Sunday service; rather, we meet to worship God, edify others, be built up, and shame the devil
Before coming to a meeting, we need to come before God to deal with our offenses and mistakes and with any condemnation in our conscience
Before coming to a meeting, we should prepare ourselves to receive grace, light, supply, and help in the meeting
From the beginning to the end of a year they never open their mouths in a meeting hence they cannot supply others or be supplied by others
In 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 Paul said that the Corinthian believers once served dumb idols, but now they served a God who speaks
When we served dumb idols, we were possessed by a demon of dumbness and were dumb, but now we are serving a speaking God
Every meeting has its own feeling and atmosphere, and we need to learn to touch and take care of this atmosphere
It would be insensible for us to begin weeping when we enter a wedding meeting or for us to sit in a funeral meeting looking cheerful
Although most meetings do not have such a distinct feeling and atmosphere, there is always a feeling and atmosphere in a meeting
In a wedding meeting, for example, everyone is happy because someone is getting married, and there is the fact of happiness
The feeling of a meeting is a spiritual fact and when the spiritual fact touches mans inward feelings the feeling of the meeting is produced
Consequently, the sense of our spirit will not be so keen, and it will lose its function when we are in a meeting
Because a person has been learning music consistently, his ears become very sharp and can distinguish a note that is either sharp or flat
There are also people whose eyes are trained to accurately determine the size of a piece of land without measuring it
After we are saved we not only need to love the Lord and follow Him we also need to exercise the sense in our spirit so that it can be keen
In this way, it will be easy for us to touch the spiritual fact of a meeting and sense the atmosphere in our spirit
Before coming to a meeting, we need to fellowship with the Lord in prayer to deal with everything between Him and us
Because some people still have many barriers between them and the Lord, they cannot sense the atmosphere of the meeting
A brother is filled with light and joy through reading the Bible at home and is singing Hallelujahs before a meeting
At the meeting he excitedly speaks of the light he received at home, disregarding the atmosphere of the meeting
Although someone may speak with us for five minutes, and we nod our head in agreement, we may not hear a word of what he said
When we put aside our personal feelings and open our spirit, we are qualified to exercise our spirit and touch the feeling of a meeting
Since our gathering together is the meeting, we cannot have a personal agenda; rather, we should all move together
There are many points to be considered concerning how a meeting begins, the steps it passes through, and how it ends
We should rise up to offer a prayer, speak a few words, or select an appropriate hymn in order to lead everyone to the subject
After the meeting is led to its subject, the spirit of the meeting may not be strong; thus, it may require some strengthening
Selecting a hymn, offering a prayer, or speaking a few words are the ways to strengthen the spirit of a meeting
When, through strengthening and uplifting, the spirit of a meeting reaches a peak, we should maintain it at this peak for a while
Sometimes after reaching the peak, a meeting goes down too quickly because of a lack in maintaining the spirit of the meeting
The most effective way to maintain the spirit of a meeting is for a few brothers and sisters to offer prayers with a strong spirit
Sometimes although everything is accomplished in a meeting, there is still time left because it is too early to end the meeting
If a meeting does not have a peak or if it is somewhat flat and if it is not time for the meeting to end there is the need to fill the time
A meeting that progresses through all the steps but has a weak ending will leave the saints without a solid feeling
In contrast, a meeting that is flat and weak in its progression but nevertheless has a strong ending will leave the saints with a good taste
Those who learn to take the lead in the meeting must learn this matter so that the meeting can end in a strong way
It may not be necessary for a meeting to progress through the steps of maintaining the spirit, filling the time, and sending off
A new believer may not be able to take care of these steps of progression in a meeting, but he needs to know these steps
If there is still more time before the meeting should end, there is the need to fill the time before the ending
These hymns do not match the atmosphere of the meeting; rather, they distract the spirit of the meeting and must therefore be corrected
When the subject is returned to the Lord's suffering, the spirit of the brothers and sisters is released through singing a hymn and prayers
We should not come to a meeting merely to listen to a message or to watch others worship; instead, we should come to meet in mutuality
For this reason, as we touch the feeling of a meeting, we should learn to fulfill our obligation to function in the meeting
We should not receive any news before a meeting; otherwise, we will have disturbing thoughts during the meeting
Reading letters or telegrams before a meeting can give us disturbing thoughts that we will be unable to drop even when we are in the meeting
We should not bring any matters related to our family, job, school, health, children, or relatives to a meeting
It is a fear of being laughed at, saying something inaccurate, praying in an improper tone, or other such things
Generally speaking, the activities in a meeting do not include more than three items-selecting hymns, praying, and speaking
A closing hymn should not be selected at the beginning of a meeting, nor should an opening hymn be selected at the end of a meeting
Sometimes there is the need to strengthen a meeting, and at other times there is the need to uplift or maintain the spirit of a meeting
Such a selection does not match the progression of the meeting, and the spirit of the meeting will be lowered rather than maintained
We should not call a hymn too loudly, too softly, or so fast that others are unable to hear the hymn that has been called
Still others call hymns with a voice that is so quiet that even those sitting next to them have difficulty hearing the number
Because the spirit of the meeting is quite tender and can easily be disturbed, all the activities in the meeting must be refined
If a sister begins to pray for her son, crying bitterly with tears, this will greatly affect the feeling of the meeting
The tone of our voice in prayer must be moderate, neither too high nor too low, and the pronunciation should be clear
Moody was in a meeting where a sister was praying nonstop, exhausting the endurance of the brothers and sisters
A soft and muffled voice is not only difficult to understand, but it can also cause the atmosphere of the meeting to sink
Once the spirit comes out, we will have a feeling when we open our mouth to speak, and when people hear us, they will be moved
If we continue speaking, even though some saints have fallen asleep during our speaking, we disregard the response of the saints
If the saints fall asleep when we are speaking we can either stop speaking and immediately sit down or we can change our manner of speaking
More than a decade ago, a group of young sisters in Tsingtao tried to imitate an elderly sister who often coughed when speaking the truth
The responsible brothers bear the responsibility to remind the brothers and sisters to raise their voice when they speak too softly
The responsible brothers should tell the saints who speak too long to be brief or to finish their speaking soon
We should submit ourselves to the advice of the responsible brothers in all the activities in a meeting, especially when we speak
Some of the hymns on remembering the Lord have the Lords glory as their subject and others in the same category focus on the Lords suffering
In learning the hymns, we need to know their categories and subject so that we can further distinguish them according to their feeling
To know the hymns by their nature, subject, and feeling is one thing, but to select hymns in the meeting is another
Memorizing the number and the first line of the hymns enables us to select hymns in a meeting according to spiritual inspiration
As a result the atmosphere of the meeting may change by the time we find the hymn or someone may grasp the opportunity and call another hymn
In Christianity and in the Catholic Church the Sunday service is altogether for the pastors and the priests who undertake all the activities
Our meetings, on the contrary, are for the brothers and sisters to coordinate with one another and to function together
In order to have meetings that are lively and rich, every brother and sister must know how to meet and must possess the skills for meeting
It is evident that a person must know the focus and activities of each meeting if he desires to serve and function in the meetings
As clearly presented in 1 Corinthians 112025 eating the Lords supper is the first significance of this aspect of the breadbreaking meeting
Every time we come to the bread-breaking meeting and see the bread on the table, we should have a strong feeling in our spirit
At His supper we partake of the bread that signifies His body that was given for us that we may obtain His life
Revelation 14:9-10 says that the fallen sinners who worship the beast and his image receive the cup of God's wrath as their portion
These verses show that on the cross the Lord drank the cup of God's wrath for us who have sinned, fallen, and should perish
The cup that we have received from the Lord is the cup of salvation in Psalm 116:13 and the cup that runs over in Psalm 23:5
We see that our remembrance of the Lord is completely different from the worldly commemoration of famous people and memorials of relatives
We need to receive Him and all that He has accomplished in our spirit as our inward enjoyment and allow Him to mingle more with us
The Christian living is a life of eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord day by day in order to allow Him to mingle with us
Catholics believe that they come to God by keeping the mass and that they are thereby forgiven and able to receive His blessings
Only those living in this way are truly remembering the Lord; otherwise, bread-breaking is but a superstitious religious ritual
According to our human concept, we may think that as we break the bread, we should tremble at the sight of the bread
We need to know that when the Lord established the supper, He passed the bread to His disciples and told them to take and eat it
When we have such fellowship with the Lord in our spirit by eating, drinking, and enjoying Him, we are fed in our spirit
Partaking of the Lord's table, as presented in 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 and 21, is mainly for our fellowship with the saints
He then explains that to have fellowship in the Lord's blood and the Lord's body is to 'partake of the Lord's table'
There are many things a Christian can do individually; he can pray, read the Bible, and even preach the gospel
In the aspect of eating the Lord's supper, the bread on the table signifies the Lord's body that was given for us on the cross
The Body in verse 17 is His mystical Body produced by the Lord's death and resurrection, and it is composed of all the saints
Each time we break the bread, we come to enjoy the Lord, remember Him, and receive the body that He gave for us on the cross
Today Christians pay attention mainly to remembering the Lord but neglect the fellowship of the Body of Christ
In the aspect of partaking of the Lord's table, the bread and the cup are the common portion that we enjoy in fellowship with all the saints
The Lord must be the goal of our singing praying speaking meditating and fellowshipping in the first section of the breadbreaking meeting
Regardless of the focus, the selecting of hymns, praying, giving of thanks, praising, and sharing should point toward this focus
After singing a hymn on the Lords love we should not follow with a prayer on the Lords suffering and then with a word on the Lords ascension
In addition to having a focus and coordinating and cooperating together, we need to move toward a climax in every meeting
Such a meeting does not have much spiritual inspiration and cannot give its participants a feeling of satisfaction
There should be prayers only of thanksgiving and of praise, not prayers of supplication, in the bread-breaking meeting
The second section of the bread-breaking meeting is entirely for the worship of the Father, taking the Father as the center
In the first section we met the Lord, received Him as our Savior, and received all that He accomplished for us
The first parable presents the Lord as the good Shepherd, who left the Father's house to seek us, the lost sheep
From our experience of salvation we see that the One who came to seek us is the Son and the One who accepted us into the house is the Father
After we received Him as our Savior, He brought us to the Father's house, and there we met the Father who accepted us
John 2:23 says, 'He who confesses the Son has the Father also'; we first have the Son, and then we have the Father
Since there are two sections in our salvation, there should also be two sections in a meeting where proper worship is rendered
When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, the life within Him was released and imparted into all those who believe in Him
Before the Lord's death and resurrection, He never called His disciples brothers; at the most He called them friends
Hebrews 2:11 says, 'He is not ashamed to call them brothers,' because they have His life, and they 'are all of One'
Just as He is the Son of God, having the life of God, all those who believe into Him and receive Him as life also become sons of God
In this section our singing, prayer, and fellowship should be directed toward the Father, taking the Father as the center
Acts 4:24 to 31 and 12:5 and 12 are two portions in the Bible that speak of the church gathering and praying together corporately
Although one person may be able to move a fifty-pound object by himself, no one can move an object that weighs one thousand pounds
If there is no harmony, it would almost be better not to pray corporately because prayer in discord, without harmony, divides and kills
Although we should consider others when we pray, we should not pray for others to hear; rather, we pray for the Lord to hear
If we pray for others to hear, there will definitely be the element of pretense and embellishment in our prayer
In the prayer meeting we need to consider others response and feeling and we need to learn to pray before God as if no one else were with us
Either they cannot open their mouth to pray, or when they do open their mouth, they cannot conclude their prayer and close their mouth
Before each prayer meeting the responsible brothers should seriously consider what matters are in need of prayer
In Acts 4:24-31, when the believers gathered together, they specifically prayed for the church in Jerusalem under persecution
After they prayed, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, proving that God had answered their specific prayer
When the whole church beseeches the Lord specifically concerning the sick brother praying for this matter, it is proper and right
The Chinese have a saying that speaks of biting off more than one can chew, which means to take on more than one can handle
In the end, some responsible ones, like those staging a show, will offer a few prayers to quickly conclude the meeting
Even though this is not due to one single matter, having many common subjects for prayer is certainly a factor
The purpose of the prayer meeting is for us to come together to pray corporately for items that are too great to be borne by one person
The saints must be in one accord, the feelings must be genuine, the utterances must be brief, and the subjects must be specific
The meeting for exercising our gifts is also a meeting of the church for all the saints to function in mutuality
Regardless of whether the brothers and the sisters met separately or whether their meetings were combined, the meeting was not successful
After holding back this grace for a long time, they become depressed, deadened, and cold, and they lose their freshness and vitality
The building up includes edification, but the ultimate goal is the building up of all the saints as God's dwelling place
If his expounding of the Scriptures is proper, logical, and full of light and supply, this gift should be exercised
In this way, the meeting will be very rich because the various gifts in the church are given the opportunity to be exercised
Finally, a basic principle of this meeting is that all things must be done properly and in order, without any confusion
According to the principle in 1 Corinthians 14:29-30, we should be willing to stop as soon as another is led to speak
Although everyone reads together and has the opportunity to fellowship what they have gained, the meeting should still have a focus
Debating kills the spirit of the meeting and does not benefit anyone; therefore, we must try our best to avoid debating
A seeking heart and an open spirit prepare a person to listen to the ministry of the Word, rather than merely attending a 'Sunday service'
We have prayer meetings, meetings for the exercise of gifts, and meetings for the ministry of the Word, but we do not have Sunday services
If this is our condition, it may be better not to have this meeting; rather, we should change it to a gospel meeting
If this is our motive, every sentence we hear will be received into our spirit and become our enlightenment and supply
Rather, since God is speaking, we should have an attitude and desire to show respect and receive His word in humility
We know from experience that once a person has been invited, that invitation will influence him even if he does not come
If the hymn is written out, we should point it out to him; if the hymn is in the hymnal, we should look it up for him
There may be some special terms in a gospel hymn; if the speaker does not explain them clearly, we should explain them to him
We should continue to visit until the person we are visiting is saved, baptized, and enters into the church life
We cannot know the church merely by studying the truth but rather by taking the proper way to follow the Lord after we are saved
Christians often have the incorrect concept that a chapel is the church and that going to a chapel is going to church
According to the Bible, the church can fear and pray ; therefore, the church is a living entity, not a dead structure
When these two words are combined to form one word, the meaning is the called-out congregation or the assembly of the called-out ones
Although the Old Testament does not speak of the church explicitly using the Israelites it presents a picture of the condition of the church
They formed a corporate body with the Tent of Meeting at the center and the twelve tribes encamped around the Tent of Meeting
On the one hand, God called them out of Egypt, which typifies the world; on the other hand, they were a congregation gathered before God
Ephesians 1:22-23 says that the church is the Body of Christ and that the church is 'the fullness of the One who fills all in all'
When the Bible says that the church is the Body of Christ, the primary significance of the church is its fullness, not its functions
The first thing people see when they look at a person is not his ability and function; rather, they see his proper appearance
When the fullness of the times comes and God's chosen ones have been filled, the church will truly be the fullness
Even though Satan has damaged the church and done a divisive work, we can still see the great matter of the fullness of the church
In spite of Satan's dividing and damaging work, we cannot deny the greatness of the church in its nature and condition
People are not clear about the ground and the way of the church because the things of man have been mixed with the church
Just as Eve came out of Adam, returned back to him, and became one flesh with him, so is the church in relation to Christ
If a church cannot pass this test, it is not the church, not the Body of Christ, but it is merely an organization in Christianity
A proper determination of the ground of the church and the way of the church must be based on this understanding
If a person has this light and this vision, do you think that he will still bring elements other than Christ into the church?
A person who has this vision touches the cross whenever he touches the matter of the church and the things concerning the church
Although there may be some who belong to Christ in these denominations these denominations groups or organizations do not belong to Christ
We need to see that the church is Christ Himself and that it is also the Body of Christ, an organism of Christ
If a condition in the church prevents us from being spiritual and manifesting our spiritual function, that church is wrong and is degraded
The Holy Spirit must have absolute freedom, and the saints must be able to manifest their spiritual condition and function
To live in the church in reality, we need to live by Christ as life, and we also need to live in the Holy Spirit
Christ expresses Himself in the universe, on the earth, among men, and in this age entirely by the church as the Body
Roman Catholicism is not the expression of Christ, and every denomination in Protestantism is not the expression of Christ
Because there is little element of Christ and little ground for Christ within them, they are not the expression of Christ
The tabernacle and the holy temple in the Old Testament were the house of God ; thus, they typified the church
The church is the house of God, the dwelling place of God on earth where He can dwell in peace and where He can entrust Himself
We do not need to see a person in order to know whether a person of high class or low class lives there; we only need to look at his house
God not only desires to make His home, settle down, and gain a place of rest, but He also desires to express Himself in the church
We may see that the church is not a structure such as a chapel or gospel hall nor an organization such as a denomination or mission
We may also realize that the church is the assembly of the called-out ones, the Body of Christ, and the house of God
If the church is not practical and concrete, we cannot touch the church, contact the church, and much less be in the church
They say that the church is spiritual and invisible and that the oneness of the church can be achieved only in heaven in the future
They also say that it is sufficient for Christians to preach the gospel to save people and help them to be spiritual
We must bear in mind that the church is not something in the future, something in heaven, or something hidden and invisible
Otherwise, the church is nothing but an empty theory, something of the imagination, something abstract, and something suspended in the air
To us, the church must be practical not theoretical, real not imagined, concrete not abstract, and substantial not suspended in the air
The church was first expressed in the city of Jerusalem ; it was surely and definitely expressed in a place called Jerusalem
Obviously, to be expressed in Jerusalem is to be expressed in the universe, because Jerusalem is a place in the universe
The universe is vast; if we say that there is only a universal expression of the church, we will not know where to find it
Everywhere in the New Testament we can find local churches, that is, churches appearing in different localities, in locality after locality
There can be only one expression of the church in a local jurisdiction; there definitely cannot be two or more
Although Jerusalem was a city with a large population, there could be only one church in Jerusalem, not two or more
In the Bible there was the church in Jerusalem and the church in Antioch, not the churches in Jerusalem or the churches in Antioch
Since a region or a province can include many jurisdictions, the Bible does speak of churches in a region or province
As far as space is concerned, the church's expression is on the earth; as far as time is concerned, this expression exists today
Neither do we need to wait for the church to be expressed in heaven, because the church is expressed on earth today
As we have seen earlier, the Bible clearly says that the church in Jerusalem was in Jerusalem and that the church in Antioch was in Antioch
The Lord's word here strongly refutes the general assertion that the expression of the church will be in heaven in the future
Although the expression universal church cannot be found in the Bible, it is not unreasonable to refer to the church as being universal
To say that the church is only universal is merely theoretical, and to say that the church is local is practical
They do not want to build the local churches because they want to build the church of Christ, the universal church
By building the various local churches among the Gentiles, was the apostle Paul not building the universal church?
The first reference to the church in the New Testament is in Matthew 16:18, where the Lord spoke of building the church
In Matthew 18:15-20 the Lord spoke of the church the second time, speaking concerning the administration of the church
It is obvious that the administration of the church in these verses refers to the administration of the local church
Today all the confusion in the church is the result of people not stressing and keeping the boundary of locality
Appointing elders in every city or in every church shows that the administration of the church is in the local church
Whether in Acts or the Epistles, all the work of the apostles was carried out in the local churches and for the local churches
Apparently, the Epistle to the Ephesians addresses the matters of the universal church, but it was sent to saints in Ephesus
If there were no local church, the saints would be unable to have a corporate living and a coordinated service
To preserve and maintain the local nature of the church, the administration must be independent in each locality
With respect to administration, the local churches are independent, but with respect to fellowship, they are one
If the church in a locality is not one in fellowship with the other local churches, that local church becomes a local sect
Retaining the local aspect is a great protection to the church, enabling the church to avoid many errors, heresies, and divisions
At the same time, a church should never become a local sect; fellowship with all the local churches must be maintained
Because all the local churches are independent in administration, the local nature of the constitution of the churches is not lost
Because all the local churches are in one fellowship, the oneness of the Body of Christ is kept, and the churches do not become local sects
Revelation 1:11-20 shows that the seven lampstands, that is, the seven churches, have the Lord Jesus in their midst
The lampstand with seven lamps was the golden lampstand in the tabernacle in the Old Testament; this is not the case in the New Testament
Among the churches, there is no higher-level church or lower-level church, no head church or subsidiary churches
The administrative independence of the local churches allows the Holy Spirit to move freely among the churches without any hindrance
There should never be distinctions such as federated churches, head churches, higher-level churches, or lower-level churches
The church in Jerusalem was the largest church, but it was not so large that it became the head church among the local churches
For the convenience of management leading and edification there is no better way than to have the local churches administrated by locality
In 1 Thessalonians 2:14 the apostle said, 'For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus'
We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ and the house of God, the vessel through which God can be expressed in the universe
The expression of the Body of Christ, the house of God, is local, and there is only one expression in each locality
We do not like to use the term unity because the church is one from the beginning; there is no need for the church to be united
The word oneness can be applied to something that is produced out of one source, one origin, and according to one principle
The church is produced by the Triune God entering into man to be his life; hence, the producing of the church is one
Ephesians 4:3-6 speaks of seven ones: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God
One person may believe in the pre-tribulation rapture, and another person believes in the post-tribulation rapture
Through one faith we enter into the new creation, and through one baptism we are delivered out of the old creation
Through one faith we become the new creation in Christ, and through one baptism the old creation in Adam is terminated
When we receive the Spirit, we receive the Son who is in the Spirit, and we also receive the Father who is in the Son
Through one faith and one baptism, we have received one Spirit, one Lord, and one God, and this produces the one Body
When we see this, we will understand why we should never do anything that would cause the church to be divided
According to the principle of the oneness of the church, the existence of the church in the universe should also be one
Regardless of whether the city was Jerusalem , Antioch , Ephesus , or Corinth , there was only one church in it
As another example, even though some are of the church of Jesus Christ, why should they hang a sign of Wesley?
Today the Protestant churches condemn the Roman Catholic Church, calling her a great harlot, but what about the Protestant churches?
Since the nature of the church is one, there can be many churches in many localities, but there cannot be many kinds of churches
Although there are many churches in different localities, the nature of these churches is one; they are of the same kind
Deformed Christianity, however, uses many invalid reasons for division, resulting in the current state of confusion
We must realize that the church cannot be divided, and we must also beware of the following reasons for confusion
Martin Luther and John Wesley were both greatly used by the Lord, but they should not have become the basis for division
Some believers in the church in Corinth said, 'I am of Paul,' others said, 'I am of Apollos,' and yet others said, 'I am of Cephas'
Since the Holy Spirit condemned the divisiveness in the church in Corinth, will He not even more condemn the denominations today?
Belonging to those through whom we were saved by whom we were baptized or from whom we received edification is condemned by the Holy Spirit
Those in the Pentecostal Church have received the gift of the Holy Spirit; hence, they call themselves the Pentecostal Church
These denominations use a certain spiritual fact to promote themselves and make this a reason to separate themselves from others
There was a group of believers in northern China who insisted that believers would all be raptured after the great tribulation
He who eats, let him not despise him who does not eat; and he who does not eat, let him not judge him who eats, for God has received him
The Bible absolutely prohibits people from forming parties and causing divisions based on these doctrinal views
We should bear in mind that although there are different social classes in society, there cannot be such a thing in the church
Any reason for division that goes against the seven points of the fundamental faith spoken of in Ephesians 4 is wrong
Every matter, whether according to fact or according to principle, depends first on its ground and then on its condition
Madame Guyon and those who were with her at that time, such as Father Fenelon and Francois LaCombe, were quite spiritual
In determining the correctness of a church, the matter of condition is secondary; the primary matter is the ground
Sadly, people's knowledge of the church is mainly based on the condition of the church, and they neglect the ground of the church
When speaking concerning a certain Christian group, they feel that there is no problem if the people are zealous, holy, and spiritual
Using the example of the Chang family, can we say that a family is the Chang family simply because its condition is good?
If we want to determine whether a family is the Chang family, we must take a look at their genealogy, lineage, and name
One person thinks that Paul is spiritual, another thinks that Apollos is spiritual, and yet another thinks that Cephas is more spiritual
If a family has the ground of the Chang family, whether they are highly educated or illiterate, they have the ground of the Chang family
If the Lord delays His coming, we will one day go to the Lord, and this testimony will spontaneously fall on the shoulders of the young ones
If we do not stand firm on the ground of the church with absolutely no deviation, these young ones will be confused regarding the church
Similarly, the church, being something so great in the universe, needs a definite place, a site where it can be placed
The foundation is the lowest part of a building, but the base is the piece of land that is underneath the foundation
Since the church is the dwelling place of God, the building of God, it not only needs a foundation but also needs a ground
You may speak concerning the universe but really you are in a locality and if you were not in a locality you would not be in the universe
The word in, which many people often miss when they read the Bible, is used in two important ways in the New Testament
Many people read obey your parents but do not read in the Lord; they read rejoice always but do not read in the Lord
Being in Christ is a matter of our redemption and enjoyment of God, and being in a certain locality is a matter of our knowing the church
The help they gave us did not solve all the problems, because their light regarding locality was not very clear
Once we are detached from Christ, we lose our position of salvation; once we are detached from a locality, we lose the ground of the church
Since a locality should have only one expression of the church, there can be only one ground of the church in a locality
Regardless of the place, if there are two 'churches' in a certain locality, either one of them or both of them are wrong
Still others come together because they have the same opinion concerning baptism, whether it is by immersion or by sprinkling
We must see that apart from the local ground, any kind of 'oneness' that is based on the same opinion is actually a division
When we are united with a group of people based on a certain opinion, we are automatically divided from other believers
It would also be a great blessing if the brothers who agree on baptism by sprinkling would not take this as their ground
Once the convention is over, each believer returns to his respective sect or denomination, and once again they are divided
We may hold other people's hands and say that we are one in the Lord, but this is a oneness only in word, not in reality
Is merely holding hands and declaring that we are one in the Lord sufficient for the oneness if we remain Baptists Lutherans and Wesleyans
Revelation 1 shows that the seven churches, signified by the seven lampstands, are independent, each on its local ground
Once the local ground is abandoned, the churches in different localities can immediately be united to form a large, 'unified' church
In 1929 Mussolini signed a treaty with the Holy See to formally acknowledge the Roman Catholic Church as an independent nation
The Catholic Church is not standing on the ground of locality but rather on the ground of the Roman Catholic Church
If the church in every locality stands firm on the local ground, it will be impossible to have large organizational unification
In lesson 15 we saw that according to the Bible, there should be only one church in a locality, not many 'churches'
There should be only one local church in a locality there should not be many churches on different streets and alleys in the same locality
We should love one another in the Lord, but since we now have different opinions among us, let us meet separately
Anything larger than a locality is an unscriptural federation, and anything smaller than a locality is an unscriptural division
If the light concerning the local ground is not sufficiently strong among us, sooner or later we will be divided
If we are not clear concerning this matter and do not hold fast to this matter, sooner or later we will be divided
We must see that the local ground is a serious matter; it guards against large federations and also avoids small divisions
There will not be a federation that is larger than a locality, nor will there be a division that is smaller than a locality
In order to take care of the ground of the church, we must forsake all other grounds and return to the local ground
We have already seen what the church is, the expression of the church, the oneness of the church, and the ground of the church
In today's deformed Christianity there are 'churches' everywhere, clearly indicating that the church is divided
The church in each locality as an expression of the Body of Christ is a foretaste of the coming New Jerusalem, the expression of God
We thank the Western brothers for bringing the gospel to China, and we are grateful to them for bringing us the Bible
How pleasant it would be if no one divided themselves into denominations, but everyone stood on one ground and took the same way
He said We do not want you to belong to the Presbyterian Church the Baptist Church the Chinese Church of Christ or any other denomination
Your stand in the denominations which divides you from other Christians has forced us to humbly rent a house on Fourth Street to meet there
What should have been a simple, single circle has been filled with many circles; this has resulted in division
A person in the world needs to be saved and become a Christian; after becoming a Christian, he needs the church
We should not be in the Roman Catholic Church, and neither should we be in the numerous sects and denominations in Protestantism
According to spiritual condition, the church that he was in might have been acceptable, but it was a part of organized Christianity
Meyer from England was very spiritual, and the books he wrote have benefited many, but he was also in organized Christianity
Knowing how to differentiate between being proper and being good will give us a solid understanding of the church
Of course, the condition of a church should be good, but having a good condition does not mean that it is a proper church
In the previous lessons we covered what the church is, the expression of the church, the oneness of the church, and the ground of the church
The only city government that can be considered legal and proper is established according to the law of that country
Those who pay attention to the condition and neglect the ground cannot discern whether a church is proper or not
They may stay for ten years, but in the eleventh year they will leave if they think that our condition is no longer good
We must take this way when the condition is good, and we must take this way when the condition is bad, because this is the proper way
New believers must see that we take the way of the church not because of a good condition but because the ground of the church is proper
Whether a certain place is Jerusalem does not depend on whether a temple is there but on whether the site for the temple is there
Even if the temple becomes desolate and is destroyed, the place is still Jerusalem because the site of the temple has not changed
We should ask only whether a certain church is meeting on the ground of the local church and not concerning its condition
It is best if the ground of the church is proper, and the condition is good, spiritual, and full of the stature of Christ
May the Lord have mercy on us that we would have the ability to discern the confusing situation of the church today
To discern whether a church is proper, we must know how divisions in the church are formed, which is also how sects are constituted
There are many other names, such as the Charismatic Church, the Church of the Apostolic Faith, and the Pentecostal Church
Once a Christian group has this kind of ground, it loses the ground of the church and thus becomes a sect, a denomination
When those from the Baptist Church come to Taipei, they do not come to build up the church in Taipei but to build a Baptist Church
When those from the Lutheran Church come to Taipei, they also do not come to build up the church in Taipei but to build a Lutheran Church
We are saved in the Lord's name , we are baptized into His name and called by His name , we meet in His name , and we pray in His name
As soon as a Christian group takes a special name other than the Lord's name, divisions, that is, sects, will be formed
In the Apostles' Creed of the Episcopalian Church one of the lines reads, 'I believe in the Holy Catholic Church'
Believing in the Holy Catholic Church does not add to salvation, and not believing does not take away from salvation
The Seventh-day Adventists' Church has a statement in their creed that says that they believe the seventh day is the Sabbath
Some people are careless and have misrepresented us, thinking that baptism by immersion is an item of our creed
Some people say that they do not have any of the above conditions and that they are non-sectarian and non-denominational
Acts 14:23 says, 'Appointed elders for them in every church,' and Titus 1:5 says, 'Appoint elders in every city'
Because there should be only one church in a locality, the ground and administration of the local church should also be one
Some groups seemingly do not have a special name special belief or special fellowship and they present themselves as being nondenominational
The one holding the string may be in the United States or England; hence, if we are not careful, we will be deceived
Even though a group may pass the above five points, we still need to examine whether there is an organizational connection behind the scenes
Special fellowship between a certain group in a locality and another group in another locality is not an organizational connection
These six points are the basis for discerning whether a Christian group will become a sect and result in division
The first three points-having special names, special beliefs, and special fellowships-are obvious and easy to detect
The church is neither abstract nor suspended in the air; rather, it is practical, real, concrete, and substantial
The source, production, nature, principle, existence, administration, fellowship, and testimony of the church are all one
Through one faith and one baptism, the church received one Spirit, one Lord, and one God, and thus became one Body and has one hope
As long as believers keep the ground of locality, the church will be one in practicality and will never be divided
These few points are clearly revealed in the Scriptures and were manifested in the condition of the early church
Whether divisions, human organization, mixture with the world, or giving opportunity to Satan, all of these are condemned by God
We can love the Lord, follow Him, and be faithful in taking the way that pleases Him in the midst of such confusion
Whether it is the Roman Catholic Church or the different denominations and sects of Protestantism, we do not want it
We do not want the ground of Roman Catholicism, nor do we want the ground of any Protestant denomination or sect
He ordained that the children of Israel worship Him in the place where He chose to put His name, His habitation
A person's preaching of the gospel in school originates from the church, and his laboring in the hospital also originates from the church
Although they were outwardly divided into two kingdoms they were still one in reality as long as the center of their worship was not divided
Similarly, if the ground of the church is not divided, it is a relatively light matter if the outward activities are somewhat divided
We can only be on the ground of the church, which is the ground of oneness, the ground of the expression of one church in a locality
All those who know the Scriptures cannot deny that in the eyes of God, the Roman Catholic Church is Babylon, a place of confusion
Although Protestantism divided from Roman Catholicism many years ago, the poison of Roman Catholicism has not yet been fully purged
In the same way that Babylon was versus Jerusalem, the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches are versus the genuine church
Some are family groups, others are fellowship groups in schools, and still others are congregations or chapels on certain streets and alleys
There are meetings that are so-called non-denominational, and there are also meetings that are for free groups
When Ezra and those with him returned to Jerusalem from Babylon, the means of transportation was bad, and the journey was very long
On the negative side this is correct but on the positive side they have not arrived at the ground on which God desires the church to stand
We are not on the ground of organized denominations, nor should we linger in any of the numerous scattered grounds in between
We do not stand on the ground of any creed; we stand on the ground of locality, the ground of oneness of the local church
Even though the administration of the church is local and independent, the fellowship of the church is universal
Since the church is an assembly, a Body, the saints should coordinate together and have a coordinated service, the service of the Body
We do not only emphasize individual spirituality, but even more we emphasize the building of the church in life
God desires to gain a house on earth to be His dwelling place so that He and all those who belong to Him can dwell in it
We are being built together in order to become God's dwelling place so that God and His children can have a home, a dwelling place on earth
Our being built together in order to be God's dwelling place not only affords God a place to dwell but also enables Him to express Himself
We desire that God would grant us grace so that His will can be carried out in all the meetings of every locality
Some in Christianity emphasize the matter of expressing Christ and living out the life of Christ but neglect the ground
We do not merely emphasize the ground while neglecting the expression of Christ, the testimony of the church, God's will, and so forth
These can all be tolerated, provided that they do not damage the basic faith or the fundamental truth of salvation
Although we practice baptism by immersion, if some want to be sprinkled because they feel at peace being sprinkled, we should tolerate it
Brothers and sisters, we should not merely speak in this way, but we should have this attitude in our practice
In the New Testament the teaching of the apostles did not require the church to define each matter in a definite way
His attitude was that he who keeps that day, keeps it to the Lord, and he who does not keep that day, does not keep it to the Lord
Rather, he said, 'He who eats, let him not despise him who does not eat; and he who does not eat, let him not judge him who eats'
We must be assured that if we all learn to live before the Lord, any differences that we may initially have will gradually be eliminated
The sister carelessly replied, 'Yes, you should cover your head; otherwise, you may not break the bread with us'
Brothers and sisters, it would be awful if this had continued, for we would have become a strict 'nametag-wearing sect'
Otherwise, a certain regulation may be established that would cause us to become a sect and thus damage the oneness of God's children
All God's children can break bread to remember the Lord with us as long as they are saved and they are touched by the Lord to do so
If we do not insist, the Holy Spirit Himself will work and gradually bring the brothers and sisters into oneness
While using one cup is more scriptural, if some insist on having many cups, we should be general and not be divided over this
If you feel to use one large cup, then use one large cup, or if you feel to use many small cups, then use many small cups
Although there is a standard, we should not insist, for example, that the Sabbath is wrong and the Lord's Day is right
One God, one Lord, one Spirit, one faith, one baptism, one Body, and one hope-these seven items are indispensable
Besides these, we may have some other things or we may not have them, and we may speak this way or we may speak that way
If this is the case, the Holy Spirit will gradually bring us to a point where we are in one accord and practice according to the Lord's word
As long as they are willing to not be divisive and are willing to abolish any existing division, any opinion or view can be accepted
We do not require other believers to drop their views before meeting with us, but we require them to abolish their divisions
Such heresies can be seen in today's so-called Modernism, which promotes the belief of the antichrists, who are an unbelieving sect
We cannot receive anyone who is related to either of these two categories of sins, even if he is a Christian in name
We are willing to have fellowship with them, but we absolutely do not want to have a part in the denominations to which they belong
Brothers and sisters as individuals are one thing, but the denominations and sects that they are in are another
As we receive the brothers and sisters from the denominations, the denominations to which they belong are also brought with them
We should not spew out the flesh because we do not want the bones, nor should we swallow the bones because we want to eat the flesh
Although we receive brothers and sisters with different views, we cannot commit any responsibility in the service to them
We feel that in raising us up the Lord has commissioned us, and we should be faithful and responsible to His commission
After receiving him, there will be problems if we ask him to immediately take up responsibility in the service
Perhaps our views are wrong, and we should be adjusted; or his views are wrong, and he can be gradually subdued
Even though every saved person is a brother and can come to break bread, not everyone can come here and be an elder
Whenever we go to a place, we should first find out if there is a meeting that is on the ground of the church in that locality
If we set up another meeting that is apart from them in that locality, we are creating a sect; we are dividing the church
Just as we do not consider the Roman Catholic Church to be proper, we also do not consider the Protestant churches to be proper
They have departed from the ground of the local church and left us, the minority, to stand on the ground of the local church
If all the believers would return to the local ground, the church in Taipei would include all the believers in the local church
When some brothers and sisters who love the Lord see that the denominations are wrong, they endeavor to change or eliminate them
The Roman Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations and sects, and even the lukewarm Brethren will remain until the Lord comes
In today's Christianity denominations and sects are reluctant to forsake their ground but desire to be united with one another
They either organize joint evangelistic meetings and joint choirs, or they exchange ideas concerning their work
The pastor of one congregation may preach in a second congregation and the pastor of the second congregation may lead the first congregation
It seems as if everyone is united in the Lord and not divided, yet in fact, this is a kind of 'shaking hands over the fence'
On the one hand, she is reluctant to leave the first, and on the other hand, she wants to unite with the one she should have married
Concerning God's plan for the church, we feel that this work is a contradiction and damage; hence, we do not wish to have any part in it
We cannot, however, approve of such works based solely on this supply, concluding that God fully delights in such works and workers
It is one thing to be used by the Lord, and it is another thing to be well pleasing to and approved of by the Lord
Because the Lord is great, even though we do not approve of these works or wish to take part in them, we should not interfere with them
Revelation 1:5-6 and 5:9-10 say that God saved us in order to make us not only His people but also His priests
Priests are a group of 'professionals,' just as teachers, lawyers, doctors, and engineers specialize in a profession
Teachers specialize in teaching, doctors in healing the sick, lawyers in handling legal affairs, and engineers in construction work
In Catholicism there is a group of people called priests, and in Protestantism there is a group of people called pastors
The Old Testament shows that God's original intention was for all the children of Israel to serve Him as priests
According to Exodus 19:6 God wanted them to be a kingdom of priests, a kingdom in which every Israelite would be a priest
As a result, there were two groups of people among the children of Israel-the priests and the congregation, the rest of the people
God has no intention of having a group of people who are priests and another group of people who are a congregation
It is sad that during the Reformation, Martin Luther did not completely purge out this evil influence of Roman Catholicism
These ones are absolutely not clergy; hence, we should never add the title Reverend to their name or call them pastors
When we were saved, we may not have been clear that God did not save us to go to heaven but to be priests to Him
Not only do we have the status of priests , but we are also a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
Just as every member in our body carries out its function, so also every member in the Body of Christ has its function
Our statuses after salvation-a priest, a slave, and a member of the Body of Christ-speak forth our need to serve God
Whenever we love others the life within us feels comfortable but whenever we hate and envy others this life feels uneasy and uncomfortable
If this serving life within us is not allowed to serve, we may feel like a bird that is locked in a cage and not allowed to fly
If a bird is released from a cage and allowed to fly freely, it will surely enjoy flying and have a wonderful time
The more a Christian serves, the more he feels released inwardly, because a characteristic of the life of Christ is to serve
Serving the Lord is troublesome and may at times be burdensome, yet we inwardly feel joyful and comfortable because this is a matter of life
To serve God in this way is reasonable; it is logical and rational, because we are people saved by grace and loved by God
When the Lord appeared to Peter at the Sea of Tiberias and asked Peter to serve Him, He asked him three times, 'Do you love Me'?
It was by this love that the Lord attracted and motivated Peter to rise up and serve Him by shepherding His sheep
The Lord did not come to force Peter to serve Him; rather, He motivated and attracted Peter inwardly with love
We now have the status, the standing, to serve, the life to serve, and the desire to serve because of the Lord's love
According to what was spoken in those lessons, we must identify the proper church and be in such a church to serve God
If we have the setting, we will not be aimless, and if we have the coordination, we will not be individualistic
When a hand is attached to the body, it is lovely, but when this hand is detached from the body, it is terrifying
There is a story concerning the eyes boasting to the feet, saying, 'If it were not for me, how could you see'?
Even though every member has something to boast of, the members actually have nothing to boast of, because they are all mutually dependent
Serving according to the Spirit, not according to the letter, means to constantly live before the Lord in spirit
In whatever we do in our service, whether dusting the chairs or cleaning the windows, we must follow the Spirit and live before the Lord
When he arrives at the meeting hall, he may see a brother who has been saved for one week and fellowship with him
A local church that binds people and prevents them from having a living service according to the Spirit should be adjusted
Seemingly, serving in the church and in the Body is a matter of regulation and is incompatible with and contrary to serving in the Spirit
When we actually serve, however, we will realize that there is nothing incompatible or contrary in this service
The more we serve in this way, the more we are on the ground of the church and in the coordination of the Body
Serving in the church, in the Body, according to the Spirit, and not according to the letter is the practice of service
On the other hand, in our practice we serve in the church, in the Body, and according to the sense in the Spirit and by the Spirit
He is not affected even if the church is not preaching the gospel, because he preaches the gospel to everyone he meets
All the brothers, whether they are teachers, doctors, laborers, servants, or rickshaw men, should devote themselves to serve God
Among us there is no distinction between those who, so to speak, serve God with their full time and those who do not
The goals of our service are preaching the gospel to save sinners, ministering Christ, and building up the church
The whole world cannot be given in exchange for these goals, and the glory and riches of the world cannot be compared to them
We kneel before You and implore You to let us serve, because this is a glorious and valuable matter, which will last for eternity'!
Still others are not appreciated for their blossoms and cannot be used as raw material; they are solely for bearing fruit
Other fruit trees, such as the peach tree and the pear tree, have attractive flowers and can also be used for timber
Since we are branches of the Lord as the vine, our responsibility is to preach the gospel, save sinners, and bear fruit
The life within us is not merely a holy life, a loving life, and a meek life; it is also a gospel-preaching life
If we want to grow, we must allow the inner life to develop so that the characteristics and functions of this life can be freely manifested
We should not have the concept that since we have 'joined' the church, we should encourage others to 'join' the church
There is no doubt that prayer and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit are needed in order to have power for preaching the gospel
A new believer does not rely that much on prayer or the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for power when he preaches the gospel
A 'mature and experienced' believer often has difficulty preaching the gospel because he has become old and cannot bear fruit
For the church to preach the gospel and save more people, new believers must be encouraged to preach the gospel
A person who was baptized last month and goes to invite his relatives and friends this month will surely be powerful, fresh, and living
Brother John Sung, who was very much used by the Lord in China more than twenty years ago, was an excellent example
A newly saved brother may be unclear concerning the Bible and unable to give a message, but as long as he preaches, people will be saved
If we wait until believers are proper before encouraging them to preach the gospel, they will become more improper
It is amazing that almost all of those who do not preach the gospel are improper, while almost all who preach the gospel are proper
They should not ask how they will know or how they will be able to preach, because the more they ask, the more unclear they will be
Philip seemed to be saying, 'Whether or not He is Jesus the Nazarene and the son of Joseph the carpenter does not matter
In the practice of gospel preaching, we should first make a list of our relatives, friends, colleagues, and schoolmates
We do not need to be concerned for those who are already saved, because those who are not saved are the objects of our gospel preaching
Acts 1:8 says that the gospel was to be preached 'in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth'
Many hold the concept that gospel preaching depends entirely on the testimony of the daily walk and not so much on speaking
Jesus can save people from their sins and from their bad habits,' he would be the first one to be delivered from his bad habits
Ephesians 6:15 says that the gospel is a pair of shoes for our feet, which keep us away from the world's filth
A person often does not have a good testimony before his neighbors because he has never spoken the gospel to them
He pointed out that Acts 4:17-18 shows that Satan always wants to shut people's mouths and stop them from preaching
We must overthrow the common concept in Christianity and not consider our own condition but simply go and speak
Although some say that gospel preaching causes trouble and brings unrest to society, actually, the gospel stabilizes society
It is a pity that degraded Christianity has turned gospel preaching into a profession that can be used to make a living
At the same time, we must not think that only those who are matured, grown, experienced, and know the truth can speak
We should hope for results, expecting large numbers of people to be saved, even expecting people of fine character to be saved
We should not have confidence in results, saying, 'It is so wonderful to have more than six hundred people baptized'
We should realize that the best ones probably have not even been baptized and that those who have been baptized may not remain for long
Someone may say that a few of the ones who were baptized are very good but some who were baptized are not so good
The ones whom we think are not so good today may be very good five years from now, even becoming elders in the local churches
Neither should we comfort ourselves, saying, 'Because we do not trust results, we do not care whether people are saved'
We should speak concerning the Lord with whomever we meet, telling them that they will be saved simply by believing
If we blush when others stare at us, our skin is thinner than paper, and we will have no way to preach the gospel
About a hundred years ago, there was a preacher named Hunter Corbett who came to northern China from America to preach the gospel
When he passed through the villages, crowds of children would follow him, throwing dirt at him and mocking him
In the matter of gospel preaching, we should abandon this sense of shame and know no shame for the Lord's sake
A believer who is severed from God is a Christian in name only, but he is no longer a Christian in his practical living
Whether we live a Christian life in reality depends on whether we are living a life in fellowship with God or are independent from God
Being independent from God means that we have broken our relationship with Him and have lost the mutual flow with Him
Man's eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in Genesis 3 was according to the principle of independence from God
Man lives without God, without needing God, without having God, without depending on God, and without contacting God
Once they die, soil and water mean nothing; the tree is independent from the soil, and the fish is independent from the water
Even if we do something very proper, we will be dead if we are independent from God, because the principle of independence is death
A life of fellowship means that we have fellowship with God, are connected to Him, and have a mutual flow with Him in everything
From the day he becomes a Christian, he is changed and can no longer decide things on his own or be independent
A life of fellowship not only has the aspect of not being independent but also has the aspect of not being individualistic
On the one hand, we are not independent from God; on the other hand, we are not individualistic toward the brothers and sisters
If we desire to be a normal Christian, we must not be independent toward God and individualistic toward the brothers and sisters
If we are like this, everything we do will be safe and secure, and it will definitely be full of light, peace, and sweetness
When we are living in this way, we are living in fellowship, and this kind of life is called the life of fellowship
In this life of fellowship, we must constantly see that we not only have God but also have the brothers and sisters
The best way for us to keep from sinning and from making mistakes is to fellowship with the saints in everything
There is a greater likelihood that we are doing something right if a brother can go with us and fellowship with us
We should not be independent toward God; moreover, we should not be individualistic toward the brothers and sisters
It is very difficult to explain the statement that God is Spirit because it is difficult to explain the matter of Spirit
These organs can be used to contact the physical world, but they are of no avail in contacting God, because God is Spirit
No matter what name man gives an image, be it Jesus or the Lord of heaven, it is in the principle of idols and offends God
In learning to fellowship with God, we not only need to realize that God is Spirit, but we must also know that we have a spirit
In order to speak clearly on the subject of man having a spirit, we should consider it from the two aspects of feeling and need
Often we have the desire to do something and a willingness to do it; our heart desires and is inclined to do it
If we decide to do it, however, a feeling may spring up from the deepest part of our being to protest and disagree with that decision
Our emotion may favor something and our mind may approve it but when we decide to do it something in our innermost being rises up to object
It is deeper than the sensation of the body, deeper than the emotion, deeper than the mind, and deeper than the will
In the Chinese Union Version of the Bible there are several places where the word spirit is translated accurately
In some places where the word spirit is not used in the original, the Chinese Union Version translates it as 'spirit-soul'
In addition to physical needs, man needs comfort, music, art, friends to talk with, travel, exercise, and knowledge
In order for man to receive Him, man must have an organ; otherwise, it would be impossible for man to receive God even if he were willing
Once we are saved, if we want to rebuke others or boast as in the past, there is an inward sense that touches and restrains us
Sometimes this sense is so strong that it seems as if it is an electric shock, and we can no longer rebuke others or boast
Even though a person may be rich, educated, and have a good family life, he may still feel unhappy and dissatisfied
At this point it becomes impossible for him not to think of the Lord and impossible for him to forsake the Lord
Before he prayed, he was indifferent, but as soon as he prays, he feels inward satisfaction, joy, comfort, and support
The gospel we heard, however, does not restrain by regulations; rather, the living Spirit Himself becomes our salvation
Whenever God visits us, reaches us, and touches us in our spirit, the joy, satisfaction, rest, and comfort within are unspeakable
According to the evidence in the Bible and our experience, the effect of fellowship has a negative and a positive aspect
Whether or not we have genuine fellowship with God can be seen by whether this function of removal is manifested in us
If it has been a long time since something has been removed from us, our fellowship with God has diminished or ceased
If we have fellowship with God, we can be certain that this fellowship will function to continually remove negative things from within us
There is no regulation related to our dealing with things; rather, this is an effect produced spontaneously through fellowship
We began to realize that some things, which we had previously not considered as sinful, were sins, and we had further dealings
After six months or a year of deeper fellowship with God, he will realize that gossiping is also a sin in need of dealing
If we always have this kind of dealing in our fellowship with God our intentions motives and speaking will increasingly be restricted by Him
Something that is not the world to one person may be the world to another, or it may not be the world to others, but it is to us
The deeper we fellowship with God and enter into Him, the more the things of the self can be gradually exposed
In conclusion, the more we live in fellowship, the more this fellowship will function to remove things from within us
If we do not know this aspect of fellowship, we will be unable to understand a person who has deep fellowship with God
John's not eating or drinking was in fellowship, and the Lord Jesus' eating and drinking was also in fellowship
We need to see that our genuine condition before the Lord does not depend on an outward standard but on inward fellowship
On one hand, this fellowship removes from us what we should not have; on the other hand, it continually adds the new element of God into us
No one can measure himself according to an outward standard, and neither can anyone measure others according to an outward standard
The very things that we gain today may be the very things that the fellowship will require us to lose tomorrow
We may say that such a brother is stable, but according to our experience of fellowship, there might be a problem in the future
Fellowship constantly changes a person; it continually discharges the old elements within him and replaces them with new elements
Praying unceasingly is a kind of spiritual breathing; it is uninterrupted and carried out at every time and in every place
Even while we are angry, we should be fellowshipping with God; we should even fellowship with God when quarrelling with others
Although we should be in constant fellowship with God, we still need to set aside some time each day for fellowship
Of course, it is more difficult for brothers who work night shifts, but they can sleep until noon and then fellowship with the Lord
George Muller even said that it is not good to travel long distances at night because it is not profitable for ones spirit and body
It is very interesting that the more fallen a person is, the more he likes to stay up late at night, and the more he loathes rising early
Our fallen nature encourages us to stay awake, but the nature within a believer encourages him to go to bed early
According to my impression from reading his biography, his longevity was very much related to his fellowship with God every morning
Although there was much labor and work, not a single burden or anxiety could harass him; hence, he lived to such an advanced age
If we touch and absorb God every morning, we will have an intelligent mind, clear thinking, and sound judgment
When we first start, it is not necessary to spend too much time; otherwise, it will become a burden that we will be unable to maintain
Whether we are traveling, working, taking a walk, or listening to a message, we can fellowship with God at all times and in all places
Given this need, some people rise early in the morning to pray outside for half an hour while others are still asleep
In those days, a few of us would go up to the mountain every day, and we would each find a spot to fellowship with the Lord
We should not say that since fellowshipping with God is a matter in spirit, the outward environment does not matter
When a Christian desires to learn to fellowship with God, Satan will work very hard to inject many thoughts into his mind
When we pray however we should not pray too long we should not pray wordy prayers and we should not pray concerning many different matters
When we come before the Lord and open His Word, we should spontaneously exercise our spirit to absorb His Word and thus eat spiritual food
As long as time allows, we can continue reading and praying, praying and reading, thereby turning the inspiration we receive into prayer
After our inner being is well fed through the fellowship, if there is still time and burden, we can pray for some matters and persons
New believers should try their best to have this kind of fellowship at least once a day, with the best time being in the morning
After touching the Lord, we can read His Word, not exercising our mind more than our spirit to absorb the Word
If there is still time and burden we can pray for other matters before God committing ourselves our families and our work into Gods hand
If a new believer practices this daily, his progress before the Lord will be fast, and the riches within him will increase
After scheduling a time, we should check with one another to see whether we are practicing according to our plan
We should thank the Lord if we are able to practice for two or three months and learn the lessons of fellowship
All orthodox Christians agree that there are two important means to fellowship with God-prayer and reading the Bible
Very often the youngest child, who least knows how to speak, speaks the most because he does not care whether his words are right or wrong
Some people make a record of the various items they prayed for on Monday, what they prayed for on Tuesday, and so forth
We do not need to remember any prayer burdens, such as prayer requests that we have received or promised others
Presently, as we are learning to fellowship with God in prayer, we can ignore matters of wording and phrasing and simply speak spontaneously
If we are pretentious and try to remember the things that we need to pray for, the feeling of being sinful will dissipate
If we contact God in a simple and spontaneous way, we will definitely sense within that we are sinful and have problems and faults
The more we confess, the more we will touch God, and the more thorough our confession, the deeper we can enter into God
They use the only verse in the Bible Haggai 17 that speaks of considering ones ways as the basis for advising people to examine themselves
Confessing our sins during our fellowship with God does not depend on introspection; it is altogether a matter of a spontaneous feeling
When we feel that we have sinned, we should confess that sin before God and ask for His forgiveness through the precious blood
When learning how to fellowship with God, many believers neglect confession and therefore never learn to fellowship in a proper way
While confessing, we need to receive the precious blood, rely on the blood, and apply the effectiveness of the blood
If she begins to pray for this one, the inward feeling will disappear, and it will be difficult for her to continue fellowshipping
Even though we are still praying, these things can become serious distractions, and we will have no way to touch God's presence
Rather, after thoroughly confessing, a spontaneous feeling to praise God and give Him thanks may arise within us
It is rather difficult to describe exactly what worship is and what our inner condition should be when we worship
It involves beholding, waiting, and inquiring; we behold God's glory, lingering before Him to wait on Him and inquire of Him
At this point some people spontaneously receive the burden to pray for certain practical affairs or to intercede, but this is not required
We should not expect that there will always be a need to intercede for practical affairs each time we fellowship with God
Sometimes we can ask them to repeat what has been spoken to be sure they understand and are clear concerning those points
We should ask, 'Brother So-and-so, how many minutes do you plan to use each day to practice, ten minutes or fifteen'?
We should discuss their schedule with them and give them suggestions, helping them to set aside a suitable time
There is still a need at the beginning of the next meeting to ask them about the main points spoken in the previous meeting
If they are practicing, we should ask them to give a testimony to see if they have encountered any difficulties or problems
In this way, the new believers and those answering questions will benefit, and we can research and pursue our growth together
In particular, the point concerning prayer being the means of fellowship requires us to lead the brothers and sisters into a practice
Only if the new believers are brought into such a living will the messages that they hear in the future have any effect on them
Perhaps not many of the seven or eight thousand brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei live in fellowship with God
As long as we lead the saints in a living, practical, and enjoyable way, the number of saints will increase spontaneously
When we read the Bible for the purpose of fellowship, we should not read for the purpose of seeking to understand it
If we read the Bible with the intention of understanding it, it will be difficult for us to enter into fellowship
We need to resolve the matter that in reading the Bible to fellowship with God, we should not intend to seek an understanding of it
Even if we do not seek to understand the Bible, we will still understand a little as a result of reading in this way
If we come to the Bible with such an intention, we will encounter a great hindrance, a distraction, in our fellowship with God
An intention to understand the Bible in our fellowship with God makes it difficult for many of us to have good fellowship with God
Only when we learn to be delivered from this intention to understand the Bible can we properly learn to fellowship with God
If we understand the Bible when we are reading it, this is fine, and if we do not understand it, we should not be concerned
We need to put all our efforts, energy, and intention into fellowshipping with God rather than studying the words of the Bible
When we read Numbers 17 where God told Moses to put twelve rods before Him, we are tempted to learn the result related to these twelve rods
We do not need to understand, research, study, read fast, read much, or ponder in order to fellowship through reading the Bible
These points are not related to reading the Bible for understanding but to reading the Bible for fellowship with God
We should let go of these things and only fellowship with God in a simple and spontaneous way through reading the Bible
When we read the Bible for fellowship, our concept should never be that we are merely reading a book or some words
Our concept should be that we are contacting the Lord Himself, because we know that the Lord is in the Word and also that He is the Word
It is possible to read three chapters in fifteen minutes without being too fast or too slow and without pondering over the contents
Although no water remains on our body after we take a bath, there is a difference between taking a bath and not taking one
It is not easy to maintain our fellowship with the Lord when reading the Bible for ten to twenty minutes in this way
Some people can contact the Lord without reading the Bible but once they start reading the Bible their contact with the Lord is interrupted
To read the Word and still be able to maintain contact with the Lord is a spiritual skill that requires much practice
If we read the Bible in this way for twenty minutes, we will have contact and fellowship with the Lord for twenty minutes
If we do not have such a feeling, our fellowship with the Lord has ceased; otherwise, we would certainly have such a feeling
When we pass through God's word, we should be like a person who has taken a bath, a person who has been soaked in water
Not only so, we should feel warm, as if we were sitting under the sun, and we should also be inwardly refreshed
We may not know what has touched us, what has enlightened us, or what we have learned, but we will be moistened
The more we read the Lord's Word and fellowship with Him in this way, the more we will know how real and sweet it is to read the Bible
We will receive much more inspiration when we read the Bible in this way than when we read it for understanding
At this stage of our fellowship with God through reading the Bible, we should not ponder, but we should meditate
We do not need to be clear whether we are reading the Bible or praying because we are reading with prayer and praying with reading
Whenever we read we should be ready to receive inspiration and then turn the inspiration into prayer and then continue to read after praying
Very often, however, we will first receive inspiration, meditate on the inspiration, and then turn it into prayer
We may stop our reading of the Bible, but the feeling should not come to an end; we must keep this feeling in our heart
In other words, if we read the Bible in the morning, we should learn to abide throughout the day in the feeling we received
In our fellowship with God it may seem as if praying and reading the Bible are separate matters, just like our right and left legs
Praying for fellowship and reading for fellowship are two elements that are absolutely indispensable in our fellowship with God
Otherwise, we may have an erroneous thought that we need a period of time for praying and a separate period of time for reading the Bible
The first difficulty new believers encounter related to fellowship is that of wanting fellowship but not knowing where God is
Because we are so used to hearing the expression fellowship with God, we may think that this is a simple matter
If God had never spoken, if He were merely God and merely the Spirit but not the Word, it would be difficult for us to be touched by Him
All the inspiration we receive is from His speaking, whether in a gospel meeting, an edification meeting, or in our personal meditation
If God were only the Spirit but not also the Word, He would be abstract to us; we would have no way to touch Him or to contact Him
When we preach the gospel, we speak words, but when the words of the gospel enter into man, they become the Spirit
A person who is saved after hearing the gospel is a person who has heard and received the words of the gospel into him
When the words of the gospel enter a person, they become spirit and life, and the person is regenerated and saved
If He were merely the Spirit, we would not be able to touch Him, and if He were merely the Word, we would also be unable to contact Him
In this way, the Spirit becomes the Word, and the Word becomes the Spirit; this way enables us to touch Him and to contact Him
We close our eyes when we pray to stop our entire outward being so that we can exercise our spirit to contact God who is Spirit
If we can lead a person to close his eyes when we preach the gospel to him, it will be easier for him to be saved
Moses immediately went to God and said O God the God of the spirits of all flesh will one man sin and You be angry with the whole assembly
He uttered a prayer before God, saying, 'Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the assembly'
If we do not drink water, we have no way to contact and receive water; if we do not breathe, we have no way to receive air
Because God is the Spirit and is in the Spirit, we need to exercise our spirit to pray in order to contact Him
We pray because God is Spirit, not to ask for things, and we read the Bible because God is the Word, not to understand doctrine
The new believers should understand that we pray because God is the Spirit, and we read the Bible because God is the Word
If the words we read remain as words only, we have not practiced sufficiently and are overly relying on our mind
Once our mind is focused on studying and pondering, the words of the Bible will not enter us but will remain merely words
We need to continue to exercise to contact the Word of God with our spirit and allow the Word of God to enter into us and become the Spirit
Our mind needs to cooperate with the Spirit so that we can interpret the meaning of the inspiration we receive
The word we contact becomes the Spirit in us, and the more we pray, the more inspiration of the Spirit we receive
We will enjoy the fellowship to such an extent that we forget our sickness, our poverty, and even the many problems in our locality
When we enter into God through fellowship, it is easy for us to know whether or not God wants us to mention such matters
He was always in fellowship and contact with God; in the end, he uttered a prayer to intercede for the city of Sodom
Certain matters do require us to pray with much effort, even to fast and fight, but this is another aspect of prayer
He wants us to worship Him, fellowship with Him, absorb Him, enjoy Him, and gain Him; this is the most pleasing to Him
The one thing, the best thing, we should do is to touch Him, worship Him, believe in Him, pursue Him, and gain Him
As we gradually become more adept in the matter of fellowship, we will taste the sweetness and enjoy the riches of fellowship in reality
