   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE BELIEVERS MATURITY IN THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The shepherds feeding is not only for the growth unto the believers daily salvation but also unto their maturity in the divine life which is needed for the God-men to be built up in the Body of Christ Heb 5:14; Eph 4:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After observing the saints for so many years, I wonder how the Body of Christ could be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some elders are too strong, while others are too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If an elder is either too strong or too weak, he is disqualified from the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only those who are mild, not so strong and not so weak, are qualified to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some brothers are very good, but they do not like to talk to people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because they know the Lord and the truth, they should be strong members of the vital groups, but they hardly ever speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some are so strong among us and others are so weak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, there is no building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no building because we do not live the life of a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The God-man living will make us fit to be built in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This living is the issue of our feeding on the milk of the word so that we can grow in our daily life unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>NOURISHING AND CHERISHING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ as the Head of the Body nourishes and cherishes us Eph 5:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ s shepherding includes nourishing and cherishing; nourishing is to feed us, and cherishing is to comfort us, to soothe us, to nurture us with tender love, and to foster us with tender care.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of this is to help us grow in the divine life that we may be full-grown and matured in it Col 1:28; Eph 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Cherishing people makes them happy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the church life, sometimes we have to make people happy in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE MANIFESTATION OF THE FUNCTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ s feeding is for the believers growth in the divine life, and the God-men s growth in the divine life is for the manifestation of their functions in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>X. THE FEEDING OF CHRIST BEING RELATED</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TO THE SPIRIT, WHO IS ALTOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The believers growth in the divine life is by feeding on the word of God, which is also the Spirit of God Eph 6:17 , and the manifestation of the believers functions in the Body of Christ is also by the Spirit 1 Cor 12:11 ; hence, the feeding of Christ is related eventually to the Spirit who is altogether for the Body of Christ Eph 4:4 to consummate the ultimate goal of God s eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever we do in shepherding and feeding others is related to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All of the God-man s living is related to the Spirit, so we must be men of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only a man of the Spirit can have a proper God-man living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AND THE GREAT PART OF THE FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>OF THE VITAL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such feeding and shepherding of Christ should be the responsibility of the elders for the churches 1 Pet 5:2; Acts 20:28 and the great part of the function of our today s vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If someone does not know how to feed and shepherd others, he is not qualified to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The responsibility of an elder is to feed and to shepherd the saints, and the greater part of the function of today s vital groups is also feeding and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Feeding and shepherding takes time and requires patience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must have patience with endurance to practice the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not expect quick fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Quick fruit comes and goes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to spend our time to feed and shepherd others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is what the Lord is doing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even today, as an old follower of Christ, I need His feeding and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I realize that very few people understand my suffering related to my age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The only one who knows my suffering is Christ, so I need Him to shepherd and feed me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is my Chief Shepherd and great Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of us need to be under the organic feeding and shepherding of Christ and be one with Him to feed and shepherd others.</S>
