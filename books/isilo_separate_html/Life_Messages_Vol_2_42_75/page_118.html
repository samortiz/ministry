Without them the earth cannot exist. The earth is for man. Without it man cannot survive. Man has a spirit which is for God. God wants man to receive Him; that is why he was created. If man had only a body, he would not be able to receive God who is Spirit. By creating a spirit in man, God made man with a part that corresponds to Himself.<p>Genesis 2:7 reads, &#8220;And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.&#8221; This verse indicates that man has three parts. His physical part was made of the dust of the earth. Then the breath of life which was breathed into him became his spirit. When the body and the spirit came together, there was the soul. The body is for man&#8217;s survival. The spirit is for him to contact God. The soul is for man&#8217;s self-expression. Of these three, the most important is the spirit, which came from the breath of life.<h2 class=head2>For Searching Man&#8217;s Inner Being</h2><p>&#8220;The spirit of man,&#8221; Proverbs 20:27 tells us, &#8220;is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the chambers of the soul&#8221; (lit.). The word spirit in this verse is the same Hebrew word as that translated breath in Genesis 2:7. The breath of life which God breathed into man became man&#8217;s spirit. Though this spirit is distinct from God, it is close to Him in nature. Thus, the spirit can receive God and also work for Him. It is a lamp, searching man&#8217;s inward parts.<h2 class=head2>For Inwardly Governing Man</h2><p>Care for your spirit! All the inner chambers of your soul must be controlled by the spirit. Every country needs a central governing body. What is the central government in you? Sorry, I do not believe it is your spirit!<p>When the brothers come together, the central government is in control because they begin by praying. The first few minutes of talk continue the atmosphere of prayer. But before too many minutes have gone by, the central government collapses! One brother expresses his opinions. Another says that the first is unfamiliar with the situation and therefore does not know how to handle it properly. The first brother then wants to know what makes the second think he is so well qualified. Is it right to heed your spirit when you pray, but disregard it when you talk to your brothers? Should it be your opinions which control you?<p>If you are older, your opinions may not be so manifested. You have been in the church life so long that your rough edges have been chipped off. Outwardly you are smooth and agreeable. Inwardly, however, you are unwilling and dissatisfied. Dissatisfaction may be your central government.<p>In the central government of the sisters, emotion holds the posts of president, prime minister, and chief of staff! The spirit is useful when they pray, but when they are angry they feel they must give vent to their emotions. Later they will repent, but at the time they give way to their temper.<p>The central government of some saints is quick action. Without regard for the spirit, they make decisions, take action, and get things done, the quicker the better.<p>It seems that only when we pray is our spirit given its normal place. As soon as we finish praying, we in effect say, &#8220;Good-by, spirit. Now that my praying is over, I don&#8217;t need you any longer. I want to take care of things myself in my way.&#8221; This kind of attitude makes us like the unbelievers. Neither they nor we are living by the spirit.<p>Even the Lord has no way to control you. You may say, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t God almighty? He should control me so that I don&#8217;t lose my temper!&#8221; God controls you in your spirit. If you do not contact Him, He cannot control you. The Lord is like electricity. If the current cannot get through to the outlet, you may have the lamp plugged in, but the light will not go on when you turn the switch.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_117.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_119.html">Next</a> </body></html>
