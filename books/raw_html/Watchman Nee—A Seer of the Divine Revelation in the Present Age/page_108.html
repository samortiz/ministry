<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. CONTACTING PEOPLE</H2><P>Watchman Nee also fulfilled his ministry by personally contacting people. He used this means mostly in dealing with special cases. He was rich in life and keen in discernment, always affording timely help to those who came to him. Through his personal fellowship, many wanderers were brought back to the Lord, many distracted believers were brought back on track, many defeated saints were recovered to the Lord's victory, many needy persons received the supply of life, and many seeking ones were enlightened to turn to the Lord's recovery. His spirit was always strong and able to discern the real situation of those who came to him. Thus, he was able to give them proper instruction either in the spiritual life or in practical matters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. CORRESPONDING WITH PEOPLE</H2><P>The last of the several general means Watchman Nee used to fulfill his ministry was correspondence with others. Contacting and fellowshipping with people by letter is the same, in principle, as contacting them personally. Letters containing questions and personal needs frequently came to him from believers in many places. If time had allowed, he could have given his full time to this matter alone. He possessed the adequate knowledge and bountiful life supply to answer the questions of his correspondents and supply their need.</P><P>What follows is an excerpt from his open letter in the fourth issue of The Present Testimony, published in July 1928. This letter reveals how much he engaged in letter writing to carry out his ministry:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In the last four months I have devoted my entire being to the writing of The Spiritual Man. Because of this, I have been unable to reply to many incoming letters which have piled up. I wish the brothers and sisters who have written me will realize that my delay does not mean I do not have a heart for you. Every letter has been carefully read. I am most sympathetic toward your problems. However, because of the time limitation, I have been unable to reply immediately. I wish all those who correspond with me will bear this in mind.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>The following is another excerpt from his open letter in the thirteenth issue of The Present Testimony, published in March 1930:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Regarding many who have written asking questions on the Bible, frankly speaking, I cannot reply. If I were to answer each question, I would need to open a Bible correspondence course. However, if there are problems concerning spiritual life, I might be able to allot a little time for them.</P>
