   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers and sisters, please remember that ministering to the Lord is much deeper than leading men to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ministering to the Lord is also much deeper than leading believers to consecrate themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ministering to the Lord is one step further than leading men to the Lord and leading believers to consecrate themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In God's eyes, leading men to the Lord and leading believers to consecrate themselves to the Lord are merely ministering to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ministering to the Lord is something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What do you see before God?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do you only see the need for the salvation of sinners?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you only see the need to render help for the progress of believers?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Or do you see something deeper?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am not here to save sinners; neither am I here to render help to believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Can you say this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I fear very much that many would say, "If saving sinners and rendering help to the believers is not my work, what shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I will have nothing to do."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Friends, besides these, do you have other work?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Oh, with many this is all they have.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many say, "If I did not do the work of helping and saving others, what would I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apart from these things, they have nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their work is confined to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you take away these things, they will have nothing left to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, if you knew the heavy burden within me, you would know the goal of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is not after the outward, lively ministering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is not after the salvation of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is not after gaining men or helping believers to be more spiritual or more advanced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has only one goal: to have men belong absolutely to "Me."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, He wants us to be before "My" presence and minister to "Me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's unique goal is not in so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, it is in "Me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I say again, I am not afraid of bothering people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What I fear most in my heart is that many will come out to preach the gospel to help men, save sinners, and perfect the believers, yet not minister to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The goal of many so-called ministries to the Lord is none other than serving their own likes and pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is unbearable for them to be confined.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are energetic and must run around and be active in order to be happy!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although outwardly they are ministering to sinners and the brothers, inwardly they are ministering to their flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they do not do this, they are not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Truly they are altogether not after the Lord's pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems that I am giving you a hard time, but this is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please remember, there are many areas in the Lord's work that naturally attract us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, this is truly damaging to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we see something naturally attractive in the Lord's work, we go about doing it!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What a pity this is!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, we must pray to God to grace us that we may know what it is to minister to God and to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have a very dear friend who is already on the other side of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She belonged to the Lord, and I loved her very much in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day the two of us were praying on a mountain, and afterward we read the portion of the Word in Ezekiel 44.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She was much older than I, so she said, "Little brother, twenty years ago I read this portion of the Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I asked her how she had felt after reading it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She said, "When I came to this passage, I immediately closed the Bible, knelt down, and prayed, Lord, let me minister to You.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not let me minister to the house.'"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brothers and sisters, I have not forgotten this incident, and I will never forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although she has passed away, I remember her words all the time, "Lord, let me minister to You.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not let me minister to the house."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Can we pray such a prayer, saying, "Lord, I want to minister to You; I do not want to minister to the house"?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I fear very much that many lust for something of God yet do not want God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many think that saving souls is the most important thing, and they would give up their jobs to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The married sisters do not want to take care of the housework, the single sisters give up their consideration of marriage, and those who have a job do not want to work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They think that it is meaningless to continue doing what they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They consider it irksome to work, take care of the family, serve, and study.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They think that it would be wonderful if they could be released to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But friends, there are only two questions: Are you ministering to God?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Or are you ministering to the house?</S>
