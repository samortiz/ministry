   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 13 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 7:10, 12, 25, 40; Gal 2:20 FOUR CRUCIAL VERSES IN 1 CORINTHIANS 7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will consider the experience of Christ in 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Nee once said that the highest level of spirituality for the New Testament believers is revealed in 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He considered that Paul's spirituality, as seen in this chapter, was on the highest peak, making Paul the most spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Corinthians 7, there are four crucial and very unique verses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 10 Paul says, "But to the married I charge, not I but the Lord, A wife should not be separated from her husband."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The phrase "not I but the Lord" is similar to Galatians 2:20 where Paul says, "It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The charge in this verse is a serious one since it concerns God's ordination of marriage, so Paul has the confidence to say, "not I but the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in verse 12 Paul says, "But to the rest I say, not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, let him not leave her."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this verse Paul is bold to speak his own word to the Corinthians, yet what he spoke became a part of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 25 Paul says, "Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul gives his opinion concerning the important matter of virgins based upon his having received mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul seemed to say, "Up to this point, I have not received a commandment of the Lord, but I give you my opinion, my feeling, concerning the matter of virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I admit that what I have to say is my opinion, but my opinion has been constituted with the Lord's mercy, making me a faithful one."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 40 Paul says, "But she is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word "opinion" in this verse may not seem to be so pleasant or sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Lord spoke, He did not have to qualify His word by saying that His word was His opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He simply spoke because as the Lord and Master, He is the "Boss."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But Paul, as a servant of the Lord, must first qualify his word when he speaks his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many so-called spiritual men today do not speak in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, they usually speak by saying, "I assure you that this is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What I say is of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul, however, did not speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He simply said what he thought according to his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet in giving his opinion, he was not alone; he had the Spirit of God with him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PAUL'S EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN 1 CORINTHIANS 7</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before he was saved, Saul of Tarsus persecuted the saints and devastated the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After he was saved, he became a different person and began to speak for the Lord in the way revealed in the preceding verses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Old Testament principle of speaking for God prophesying is, "Thus saith the Lord" Isa 10:24; 50:1; Jer 2:2; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the New Testament principle of incarnation is, "I the speaker charge."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The speaker and the Lord are one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Paul spoke, you can say not only that he spoke but also that the Lord spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul and the Lord were one in the principle of incarnation.</S>
