   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I do believe many young ones are burning to serve the Lord with their full time.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some have been hindered from doing so by the thought of the difficulty they will have in obtaining a living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But let me tell you that whenever we think anything about the matter of making a living, we are religious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With the living Jesus, with the resurrected Christ, there is no problem of making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even without the sea, even on the land, if we need fish, the fish will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It all depends upon whether or not the Lord Jesus is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have the resurrected Christ with us, we may forget about all religious schedules and also about our living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The living Jesus not only cares for our spiritual need, but also for our physical need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is not a dead religion; He is not a dead mission board.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the fishes are under His command.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the record of the four Gospels, Peter learned three lessons throughout his life from fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first is recorded in Luke 5:1-11, where Peter was called by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time he caught a multitude of fish at Jesus' word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second instance is recorded in Matthew 17:24-27, where Peter was told by the Lord to go fishing and find the tribute money in the fish's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now in John 21 we have the third instance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am so thankful that we never read of Peter going back to fishing again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Typically speaking, the day in which we are living is in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All night we must be kept from any religious attempt, any religious way of carrying on the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Don't count your dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Don't look into your bank account.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Don't estimate how many fishes you will need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Last summer we had a large conference here in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The responsible ones knew nothing about schedules or budgets and did not calculate what they were going to spend beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After it was over, I asked them concerning the conference account.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I knew that we had spent much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually we discovered that every need was fully met with a surplus remaining.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Praise the Lord for that lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You see, this is the living Jesus, not a dead religion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is Christ, not anything scheduled in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything recorded in John 21 is undoubtedly with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Chapter 21 cannot compare, in a sense, with chapters 14 through 17 of John.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in another sense it is such a worthy and meaningful chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am so grateful to the Lord for it now.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I cannot tell you how much I love John 21.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is so practical and unreligious.</S>
