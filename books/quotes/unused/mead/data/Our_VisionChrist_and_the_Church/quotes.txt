[1]  CHAPTER ONE THE VISION OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:15-18; Eph 5:32; Rom 12:4-9; Col 1:24-29 VISION AND SERVICE
[2]  Rather, this is to say that because we know the Christ who is life in us and because we love Him, consecrate ourselves and our everything to Him, have fellowship with Him, and live in Him, He spontaneously builds us up together.
[3]  If we have seen the vision of Christ and the church, the goal of all of our service will be to help others receive Christ as life, so that they may become proper materials who are built up in the church.
[4]  Chapter six tells us that through faith and baptism we are united with Christ, that we are in Christ, and that we have received Christ s death and resurrection.
[5]  The Spirit shows us here that when we present our bodies, the result is that all these gifts, functions, will be manifested in the Body of Christ, which is the church, for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[6]  If you truly live by Christ and serve God by Christ, and if you truly desire to admonish others in all wisdom for them to gain Christ and be built up into the Body of Christ, then you must be ready to pay a price and also to undergo sufferings.
[7]  Please remember, however, that the price we pay will enable us to gain the glorious Christ and the glorious church, and the sufferings we undergo are for us to gain the glorious Christ and the glorious church.
[8]  John 6:57 says, As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me. This word means that just as the Lord did not live by Himself but by the Father because the Father lived in Him, so we who eat the Lord, who receive Him into us as food, also live because of Him.
[9]  If we want to take Christ as our life and live by Him, we also need to see that I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me, as the apostle said in Galatians 2.
[10]  Brothers and sisters, if we take the Lord as life and live by Him, the result will be that we will be built by the Lord to be His church.
[11]  If we truly desire to be built up as the church, we must take the Lord as life and live by Him.
[12]  If we have truly learned this lesson in a serious way, living not by ourselves but by the Lord and taking not ourselves but the Lord as life, then spontaneously we will be built together with all the saints to be the Lord s church.
[13]  Such a living is altogether the result of our living by Christ, taking Christ as our life, and allowing Christ to live in us.
[14]  When you take Christ as life, allow Christ to live in you, and allow Him to live out through you, the issue will be the church.
[15]  Therefore, if we want to know whether a person is taking Christ as life and whether he is living by Christ, we just have to see whether or not the church is the issue of his living.
[16]  If we take Christ as our life, living by Christ and allowing Christ to live out of us, the issue will definitely be a living in which we are members one of another.
[17]  If I live in Christ and take Christ as my life, I cannot help but live out the church life, and I cannot help but say to the brothers and sisters, I need you.
[18]  By His mercy may all of us who serve the Lord see this vision that in all things we may take Christ as life and live by Christ, so that the church can become our living and our testimony.
[19]  Although the Bible says that the mystery of God is Christ and that the mystery of Christ is the church, only when Christ and the church are mentioned together does the Bible say that this is a great mystery.
[20]  We should pursue to know how Christ, in whom is all the fullness of the Godhead, comes into us to be our life.
[21]  Our pursuit today should not be concerned with how to be fervent, how to do good, or how to be determined; it should be concerned with how to know more about Christ being our life.
[22]  We must be able to differentiate between our zeal and Christ, between our goodness and Christ, between our love and Christ.
[23]  Rather, we should pay attention to asking ourselves in everything we do whether what we are doing is of Christ or of our natural life, whether we are living by Christ or by ourselves.
[24]  We have said many times that Christ is our life and that the church is our living.
[25]  The more we know God s heart and the more we have His vision, the more thoroughly we will know that God s intention is for Christ to be our life inwardly and for us to live out the church outwardly.
[26]  For example, chapter three of Colossians, a book on Christ as the Head of the church, has the phrase Christ our life v. 4a . This shows us that the reason Christ can be the Head to the church is that He is our life.
