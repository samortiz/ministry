<h2 class=head2>C. By Studying</h2><p>You also need to use your mind in studying the Word of God. You must let the word of Christ fill your mind and let it dwell in you richly (Col. 3:16). When you study, you must think; as you think, you must pray and enjoy. This practice will help us receive the milk of the word for our mental faculties and will nourish our spirit. You may study a book in the Bible, such as John or Romans, with the help of the footnotes and the references in the Recovery Version, as well as the corresponding life-study messages. Thank the Lord, we have the Recovery Version and the life-study messages for every book of the New Testament. You may study any book in the New Testament with the aid of so many helpful publications. You may study the lesson books for the junior high and high school students. You may study the Life Lessons and Truth Lessons. There are many ways for you to study. Fellowship with your parents, serving ones, and elders concerning how you may study the Word of God.<h2 class=head2>D. By Memorizing</h2><p>We also need to memorize the Word of God. This may be overlooked by most saints. Memorizing the Word of God is very helpful. Have you ever experienced a lack of the Word of God in your preaching of the gospel? You may not know what to say when preaching to a friend. If you memorize a verse a day, in three years, you will have about one thousand verses memorized. You will not have to worry about what to say or where to find the verses you want to quote. Young people should definitely memorize verses. What you memorize in your youth may never be forgotten. You can use the verses for the rest of your life. Your mind becomes cluttered with too many things when you get older. Ecclesiastes 12:1 says, “Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth.’’ One of the best ways to remember the Lord is to memorize His word. Psalm 119:11 says, “Your word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against You.’’ What you keep in your heart (mainly your mind) will help to keep you from sin and will help to form you according to God’s desire.<p>In conclusion, we must use our spirit and our mind to contact the Word of God daily to receive the Spirit and life that we may be enriched. Then we may have a strong spirit to experience life and to grow in life until we reach maturity.<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Why is it so important for us as Christians to know the Bible?</li><li>What is the essence of the Word of God?</li><li>How does the Word become Spirit and life in us?
