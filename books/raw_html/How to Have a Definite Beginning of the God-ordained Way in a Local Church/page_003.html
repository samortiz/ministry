<P>We should take the tutoring and coaching way to train all the ones under our care to prophesy first in the group meetings as an exercise and then in the church meetings as a practice. Eventually, nearly all the ones under our care will be able to prophesy. Many of the saints have a heart to prophesy, but they do not know how to do it. We need to teach them. Most of the saints in the churches now prefer to have the meetings of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 with all speaking for building up. They do not want to go back to the old way. When only one person speaks, he is overburdened and the audience eventually gets tired of his speaking. When many saints speak in the church meetings week after week, this maintains the freshness. Whenever we function in a meeting, that meeting is the best to us. If we do not function, we may say that the meeting was poor. When we function and are expecting to function, the meeting becomes an enjoyment to us, and we desire to come to the meeting. When all speak in the church meetings, this stirs up every member of the Body.</P><P>We need to pray definitely for the purpose of carrying out the God-ordained way in all the churches with much patience and learning. The leading ones and some of the leading seeking ones should also fellowship with the rest of the saints that they may gradually, one by one, participate in the learning and practice of the God-ordained way. Some of the saints will follow the leading ones to practice the new way. But the leading ones will have to contact the others to fellowship with them so that they can gradually enter into the new way.</P><P>The leading ones and the leading seeking ones should also, if possible, visit the other churches that have advanced in the God-ordained way, that such a visit may render some mutual help in the carrying out of the God-ordained way. There needs to be the traffic among the churches that we may learn of others. In this way all of us will receive the mutual help in carrying out God's ordained way to organically build up the Body of Christ.</P><P>Practicing the God-ordained way requires our diligence. We must set up a certain time every week to practice the new way. This is not an easy thing. If we do not budget our time, it will be wasted. For the Lord's sake, we should dedicate at least three hours a week to the Lord to go to visit people. We can join with others in a team to carry this out. In principle, we should not let anything frustrate us from keeping this time set apart for the Lord's interests. If we dedicate this time to the Lord, we can yearly have two remaining fruit living in the church life.</P>
