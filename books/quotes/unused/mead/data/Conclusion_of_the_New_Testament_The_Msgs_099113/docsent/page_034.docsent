   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the Holy Spirit with God's Holy Nature Dispositionally</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As saints we are also being sanctified dispositionally by the Holy Spirit with God's holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit is changing our disposition by causing it to be mingled with the holy disposition of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is subjective sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sanctification is not only a matter of position, that is, to be separated from a common, worldly position to a position for God, as illustrated in Matthew 23:17 and 19 where the gold is sanctified by the temple and the gift by the altar, in changing their position , and in 1 Timothy 4:3-5 where food is sanctified by the saints' prayer .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sanctification is also a matter of disposition, that is, being transformed from a natural disposition to a spiritual one, as mentioned in Romans 12:2 and 2 Corinthians 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a matter of a long process, beginning with regeneration 1 Pet 1:2-3; Titus 3:5 , passing through the whole Christian life 1 Thes 4:3; Heb 12:14; Eph 5:26 , and reaching completion at the time of rapture, at the maturity of life 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning subjective, dispositional sanctification, Romans 15:16 says that the believers are being "sanctified in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ died on the cross primarily for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now, in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit, He lives within us for our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is our life, and He is saturating our being with His holy nature so that we may be thoroughly sanctified dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the reason that in Romans sanctification is not positional by the blood but dispositional by life, even by the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit is working within our spirit, spreading Himself from the center of our being throughout every part of us until He reaches the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we shall be completely saturated with God's holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, our whole being will be sanctified by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be put into Christ is a once-for-all matter, but to be sanctified by the Spirit is a life-long matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the very moment we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, believing in Him, we were put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way we are now sanctified in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because God has put us into Christ, the Spirit has entered into us and has become the sanctifying Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now this Spirit is sanctifying us all the time, and will continue to sanctify us during our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, today we are still under the sanctifying work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Another verse that speaks of dispositional sanctification is 2 Thessalonians 2:13: "God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The salvation unto which we were chosen by God is salvation and sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are being saved in sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While the Holy Spirit is sanctifying us, God is saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we are being saved in sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This sanctification of the Spirit is actually the divine transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit is in us to sanctify us with the divine element, which is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1 Thessalonians 4:3 Paul speaks of sanctification, and this sanctification is of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The indwelling of the Spirit is actually our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit indwells us with one goal to sanctify us, to transform us, to change us metabolically.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every day we are being sanctified, and the One who sanctifies us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the reason the Bible speaks of the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All day long the Spirit is sanctifying us, applying to us what the Father has planned and what the Son has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit has been commissioned to sanctify us; He has been given to us for the purpose of completing the work of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As saints, we have such a practical, living, and subjective Sanctifier.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With sanctification the emphasis is on separation unto God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our sanctification began even before our repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we heard the gospel, the Holy Spirit began to sanctify us, to separate us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we experienced regeneration, which is also a part of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After regeneration, we are in the process of being sanctified dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, we shall be glorified, and our glorification will be the final, the ultimate, sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we are glorified, we shall be fully separated unto God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although with sanctification the emphasis is on being separated unto God, this does not mean that sanctification does not involve the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The dispositional aspect of sanctification especially involves God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, subjective sanctification, which is dispositional sanctification, is actually transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through our experience we have come to realize that, as the sanctifying Spirit, the Spirit is dispensing His element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This dispensing of the Spirit is the sanctifying work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit is to dispense His element and essence into our being to sanctify us dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, we are fully saturated with the Triune God and wholly separated unto Him for His purpose.</S>
