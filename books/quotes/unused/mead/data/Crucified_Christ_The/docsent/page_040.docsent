   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A CHRISTIAN BEING ONE WHO HAS CHRIST IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A Christian is one who has Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek form of the suffix -ian of the word Christian denotes man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people think that to be a Christian is comparable to being a disciple, but in fact, it is not so.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whereas a disciple may simply refer to an apprentice, a Christian refers to a Christ-man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For instance, suppose we have a glass that contains water.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We would then call this glass a water glass.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was originally just a glass, but after we put water in it, it becomes a water glass.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same way, formerly you were just a man, but now you contain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, you are called a Christ-man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the term "Christ-man" sounds quite strange, so the Bible translators use the word "Christian" instead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, today many people have a misconception, thinking that a Christian is a disciple of Christ who learns of Christ, a person who does whatever Christ did.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, the word Christian in Greek simply means "Christ-man" a person with Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is in him, and he and Christ are joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is mingled with Christ, and Christ is mingled with man; this is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, a Christian is one who has Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is in Christ, and Christ is in the Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The people who have Christ in them are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A saved person must have Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he does not have Christ, he is not yet saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a person has Christ in him, he is a "Christ-man," a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE CHURCH BEING THE TOTALITY OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE CHRIST IN THEM</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then what is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is a composition of all those who have Christ in them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have Christ in me, you have Christ in you, and he has Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Christ in each of us added together is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if there were no other Christians in Taipei except a few of us, when we were added together, we would still be the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is the mingling of Christ with all those who belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Collectively, these ones are called the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some people say that they are going to church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In fact, to say this is not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are not going to church but to a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church, however, is not a meeting hall or a building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is Christ plus all those who belong to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person who belongs to Christ is called a Christ-man, and when a group of people who belong to Christ are added together, they are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because people do not know this, they think that the church is a place of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the English language, people always use the word church to refer to both the church and a place of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is due to a lack of knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some who know the Bible have used the word assembly for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is a group of people who have received Christ and who all have Christ in them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Please remember that God was in Jesus the Nazarene, whose name was Christ, and that this Christ has entered into many people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Individually these ones are Christians, and corporately they are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Bible another spiritual term for the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the New Testament, the title Christ has two different meanings or two different usages.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In some places it refers to the Lord Jesus Himself, but in other places it refers to the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The individual Christ refers to the Lord Jesus Himself Matt 16:16 , whereas the corporate Christ refers to the Lord Jesus and those who have Christ in them 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is the corporate Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose I point at Brother Huang's head and say, "This is Brother Huang."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is this right?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yes, this is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose I point at Brother Huang's body and say, "This is Brother Huang."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Is this right?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yes, this is also right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brother Huang's head is part of Brother Huang, and his body is also part of him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The two added together are Brother Huang.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A Christian is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is because what is within a Christian is Christ, and what is within the church is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since degraded Christianity has not seen this due to a lack of light, many people say that the church is a charity organization or an evangelistic mission.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These names are superficial and degraded and do not indicate the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The content of the church is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ is the church, and the totality of all Christians is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some people believe in Buddha.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The world calls this Buddhism.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At the same time, some believe in Christ, and the world calls this Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, Christianity has become one of the world religions.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It has become a religious organization that is without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although there is no such thing as Christianity in the Bible, in the human race there is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What is Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Christianity is a religious organization that has lost Christ and is without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Individually, a person who has Christ is a Christian; corporately, all those who have Christ are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, today there is a group of people who belong to Christ in name but do not necessarily have Christ within them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In terms of being a religious organization, they can be considered a part of Christianity, but if they do not have Christ within them, they are not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In other words, what people consider to be Christianity is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What people consider as Christianity is a religious organization, an evangelistic mission, but the genuine church is composed of those who have Christ in them as their life and content.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Within these people, all of their personality, disposition, thoughts, interests, desires, feelings, and contents are just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When people touch them, they do not touch merely their outward being, but they touch the Christ within them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>For example, you may touch a water glass, but what you drink is the water in the glass.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The reason it is called a water glass is that it contains water.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Similarly, a group of people is part of the Body of Christ because within them they have Christ as their content and they are filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Paul said that the Jews required signs and that the Greeks sought wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Jews believed in God, but they required signs.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Through and through, all that mattered to them were signs.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Greeks sought wisdom, and they talked about knowledge with regard to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, Paul said that we who serve God do not preach the Jewish religion or Greek philosophy we do not preach signs or wisdom but we preach Christ 1 Cor 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Please bear in mind that the spiritual reality of the church is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To say this in the simplest way, Christians are those who have Christ in them, and the church is the sum total of all those who have Christ in them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After hearing the gospel, someone may say, "I cannot believe right away.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I have to do a little study first."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Outwardly speaking, this word is reasonable, but in fact, this is not the way to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>For our education, it is right to study, but it is not right when it comes to believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>For instance, when someone gives you an orange, do you study it before eating it?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>No one would study an orange before eating it.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If you try to study the Bible before you believe in Christ, then I am afraid that after you have studied the entire Bible, Christ will still be Christ, and you will still be you.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>You will have nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Why will this happen?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This will happen because although you may have used your mind to study Christ, inwardly you have never touched Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Even if after your thorough study, you finally approve of Christ, understand the doctrines of Christ, and are baptized, you still will not be a Christian if Christ has not come into you.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Thus, you will still not be a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Some elderly women who live in villages and may be considered nearly illiterate have received Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Such ones do not know Genesis, nor are they clear about Revelation, but they have received Christ inwardly and have contacted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>They pray all the time and allow Christ to fill them.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>When you contact them, you sense a sweet and glorious flavor, because what you touch is neither Christianity nor doctrines but a living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Although they cannot read much and are not eloquent in prayer, when you pray with them, you sense a sweetness, and you have the feeling that they have brought you to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is because they have Christ in them, and they are filled with Christ inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Not only so, this is spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The genuine church is not the Christianity seen by men outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Neither is it the doctrines of Christ outwardly studied by people.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The genuine church is the living Christ who has become our life and content.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This is the reality of the church, the spiritual reality.</S>
