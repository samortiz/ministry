   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God created man in a way that he needs a wife as a helpmate to match him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But the highest purpose in God's giving a wife to a brother is to give him trouble so that he can be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many times it is the wife who troubles the husband the most and the husband who troubles the wife the most.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God uses this situation to transform the husband and the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The wives perfect the husbands, and the husbands perfect the wives.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even our children become helpers to us in the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also need a job in order to live, and our job is used by the Lord to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All of our daily necessities are troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>People like to have a car, but the car becomes a trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>People like to have computers, but computers also become a trouble to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These troubles are ordained by God so that we can be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In my earlier ministry, I told people that our circumstances and environment are ordained by God for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But I did not realize as much as I do today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything we need becomes a trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God ordained these things so that we could be sonized, transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Transformation is a continuation of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have been regenerated and we are a new man, but the process does not stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The butterfly does not come out of the cocoon overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It comes out slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sanctification, renewing, and transformation are all a continuation of regeneration to make us a new man with the divine and human natures.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, 1 John 3 says that when He comes, we will see Him, and at that time we will be the same as He is v. 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has only one way to go in this whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the way of His economy to gain many sons for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first step God took was His choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 1 tells us that God's choosing was for His sanctification, for us to be holy v. 4 . God chose us in eternity, predestinating us unto sonship v. 5 . He chose us with an intention to get sons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After His choosing, He came as the Spirit to sanctify us, to separate us, from the heap of common people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit came to seek us, to enlighten us, to find us, and to get us Luke 15:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He worked to convict us John 16:8 , causing us to repent and stirring up our heart that we might have the desire to go to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we became believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After He sanctified us as the Spirit, He regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Peter 1:2 speaks of God's choosing and the Spirit's sanctifying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then verse 3 says that following His sanctification, He regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regeneration is the step following the Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, God chose us; then God the Spirit came to sanctify us; and sanctification is for sonizing, which begins with the Spirit regenerating us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For us to study the work of the Spirit on and in the believers is for us to study the real Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Soon after I was regenerated, I wanted to know the real significance of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was very difficult to find anyone who taught this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, I read a book by T. Austin-Sparks which really helped me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In that book he spoke a very precious word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said that regeneration is to have God's life, as another life, in addition to your human life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the proper definition and significance of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the Lord to give us a second birth means that He gave us another life, a second life, the divine life.</S>
