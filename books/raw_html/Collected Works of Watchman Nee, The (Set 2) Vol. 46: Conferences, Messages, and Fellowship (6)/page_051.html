<h2 class="head1">ROMANS 14</h2><p>Paul is very strong in verse 4. "Who are you?" he asks. (In Greek the pronoun "you" is emphasized.) In effect Paul is saying, "What authority do you have to judge another person's servant? You are not his master." According to Paul, we are not merely judging our brother when we judge another believer, we are judging the Lord's servant. He is responsible to the Lord alone, not to us. We are very presumptuous if we take such matters into our hands, playing the role of a pope and seeking to regulate all the affairs of the church.</p><p>Remember that Paul was not arguing for vegetarianism at all. His reasoning was simply, "Do not meddle with the Lord's business; leave it to Him. If God has been able to open your eyes, can He not open the eyes of others? Leave them to Him. You must be patient with others just as the Lord has been patient with you."</p><p>"The Lord is able to make him stand" (v. 4). We should trust God and show our trust in Him by leaving the situation in His hands. Just as we believe in the Holy Spirit in us, we should believe in the Holy Spirit in our brothers. We need not try to act like the lord of all the saints and seek to put them right, as though God could not care for His church without us.</p><p>Verse 5 says, "Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind." What should we do? Should we insist that the Lord's Day be kept? Should we write a book and attack the Seventh-day Adventists in our midst? Should we not do something about this? Will not the unity of the church be endangered if we do not take things in hand? This was not Paul's thought. According to him, we have no business meddling with thoughts of others. Our business is to be clear in our own mind. We always try to get order by rules and regulations, but Paul did not try to regulate things. He did not put the emphasis on things, but on the Lord.</p><p>In verse 6 the phrase "to the Lord" is important. If a vegetarian sought fellowship with me, I should ask, "Do you refrain from eating meat because it is an idea of yours, or do you do it to please the Lord?" If he said, "To please the Lord," then I should reply, "If you can serve the Lord better this way, praise His name; go ahead." We must always seek to stress the central point of Christianity, that is, that those who live should live to the Lord and those who die should die to the Lord. Wherever we see that the central point is right, we should praise the Lord and not stress externalities. We should never lay emphasis on the technical side of Christianity, but always on the fundamental matter of doing everything "to the Lord." We must never seek to lead those who differ from us to think and act as we do, but simply seek to lead them closer to the Lord. The chief point is not whether we eat meat, but whether we are living to the Lord. We must help the saints see their responsibility to the Lord alone. If their relationship with Him is right, everything else will adjust itself. Alas! many are not seeking to lead others to a closer relationship with the Lord, but to a closer conformity to certain things. They are working for outward correctness; this is Pharisaism. The Pharisees had much in the way of outward form and outward correctness, but they had no relationship with God. Even if we make alterations and adjustments and eventually reach a point of perfect correctness in outward things, nothing has been gained in God's sight unless our relationship with Him is right. Augustine said, "In things essential, unity, in non-essentials, liberty, in all things, charity." We naturally want everyone to be like us, but if others differ, this is our opportunity to bear the cross. If we make the Lord the center of life, even if there is some divergence in external matters, everything else will be well. David went into the tabernacle and ate the showbread, the penalty for which was death. But it did not matter because David was for the Lord; his heart was right toward God. We must continually bear in mind that the central point of Christianity is the lordship of Jesus Christ. If Jesus is your Lord and Jesus is my Lord, then everything will be all right between us. The whole question is this: "Is the Lord the center of all in your life and mine?"</p><p>Verse 8 repeats the phrase "to the Lord." We do not want to lead our brothers to a point of perfect outward correctness, but to the point of living "to the Lord" and dying "to the Lord." This point should be repeatedly emphasized. If a person comes to me and argues strongly against baptism by immersion, I should not argue with him, but obey Paul's injunction in verse 1 and "receive [him], but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his considerations." This does not mean that I should keep silent, but that I should only ask, "Are you living to the Lord? Do you think that by not being baptized you are glorifying Him, or do you have a controversy with Him over the matter? Are you resisting Him by not being immersed, or are you doing it to please Him? I only care whether your relationship with the Lord is right." If you are not immersed, then I can ask, "Are you not immersed out of fear of man or to please the Lord?" If you are immersed, then I can ask, "Are you immersed to please man or to please the Lord?" We do not want to stress technical correctness but spirituality. Of course, we want to be technically correct as well because we want to serve the Lord as those who are "approved to God" (2 Tim. 2:15).</p>
