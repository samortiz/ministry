   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Rachel Having Brought Forth Joseph,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>a Nazarite, a Type of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob had twelve sons: six, including Levi with the priesthood and Judah with the kingship, were born of Leah; two, Joseph and Benjamin, were born of Rachel; two, Dan, the worst, and Naphtali, one of the best, were born of Bilhah; and two others, Gad and Asher, were born of Zilpah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Benjamin and Joseph, the two sons of Rachel, are both types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although Joseph was born first, in typology he is the continuation of Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The record of Joseph's birth does not indicate that he is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But, as we have seen, the birth of Benjamin clearly reveals that he is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Benjamin, the son of sorrow and the son of the right hand, is continued by Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From chapter thirty-seven to the end of the book of Genesis, we have the record of Joseph's life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Joseph, a Nazarite, one separated unto God, is surely a type of Christ 49:26, "separate" in Hebrew is "the Nazarite" .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Joseph typified Christ as both the Son of sorrow and the Son of the right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After his suffering and exaltation, Joseph was seated next to Pharaoh on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we come to the record of Joseph, we shall see that in every respect he is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the time being, one example is sufficient to illustrate this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Joseph was in prison he had two companions 40:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later, one of these companions was saved and the other perished 40:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was accompanied by two thieves, one of whom was saved and one of whom was lost Luke 23:32-33, 39-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How marvelous is this typology!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the first part of his life, Joseph suffered as the son of sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the second part of his life, he was exalted to be the son of the right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was lifted up to the throne at the right hand of Pharaoh and was empowered to administer the life supply to all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, as we have pointed out, in typology Joseph is the continuation of Benjamin, the son of sorrow who became the son of the right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Benjamin and Joseph were born of Rachel, Jacob's natural choice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to God's ordination, natural things are not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has ordained that we get married.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although married life is natural, it is ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Never say that natural things are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you say this, then you should stop eating, for eating is a natural necessity ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Young people often say, "Why must we be troubled with food and clothing?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And why do we need to sleep?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If God had created us without the need for food, clothing, and sleep, life would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Besides, who likes to stand in front of a hot oven, and who enjoys washing dishes?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How good it would be if we were not bothered by such things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I wish we could exist without all these necessities."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, God has ordained marriage, eating, sleeping, and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although these things are natural, they have been ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Like all men, Jacob needed a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he came to the home of his uncle Laban in Padan-aram, the first person he met was Rachel 29:9-11 , and she immediately became his choice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Certainly this was sovereignly arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As Jacob looked at Rachel, he might have said, "This is my choice."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jacob loved Rachel and agreed to serve Laban seven years for her 29:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God was sovereign in causing Jacob to meet Rachel first, and He was also sovereign in allowing Laban to play a trick on Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although Laban had betrothed Rachel to Jacob, at the time of the marriage he gave him Leah instead 29:21-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Laban's deceitfulness frustrated Jacob from having his choice.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Jacob then made a deal with Laban to serve another seven years for Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to have his choice he was willing to suffer this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As Jacob was working those years for Rachel, every time he saw her, he must have yearned for her.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But he could not have her.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although none of us would have been this patient, Jacob patiently waited out this time, and eventually Rachel was given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This record is full of spiritual meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God has ordained us to have our natural choice.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But under God's sovereignty we must be kept from having it for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the one hand, Jacob was frustrated from having his natural choice; on the other hand, he was permitted to have it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that although God has ordained something for us, He will not allow us to have it according to our way and according to our time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Undoubtedly, Rachel was ordained by God for Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But God did not permit Jacob to have Rachel according to his way and his time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jacob wanted to have Rachel immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After Jacob finally had her, he certainly desired to keep her for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, at a certain point God seemed to say, "Jacob, I shall take Rachel away from you."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not speak this in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From my experience I know it is real.</S>
