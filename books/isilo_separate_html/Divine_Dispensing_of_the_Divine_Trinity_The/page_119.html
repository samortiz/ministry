<p>In chapter twelve of 1 Corinthians we have all the functions of the members of the Body, and in chapter fourteen we see that the functions are for the building up of the church. Then in chapter fifteen we have what we may call the basic factor. This chapter does not speak of gifts or functions; however, it does reveal the basic factor of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Died for Our Sins</h2>
<p>In 15:3 Paul says, &ldquo;For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s death for our sins, His burial for our termination, and His resurrection for our germination with life, according to the prophecies of the Old Testament (Isa. 53:5-8, 10-12; Psa. 22:14-18; Dan. 9:26; Isa. 53:9; Psa. 16:9-10; Hos. 6:2), are the basic items among the first things of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Been Raised Up by God<br />
from among the Dead as the Firstfruit</h2>
<p>In 15:4 Paul continues, &ldquo;And that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&rdquo; The Scriptures in verses 3 and 4 denote the Old Testament, that is, the law and the prophets. Of the three matters mentioned here&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s death, His burial, and His resurrection&mdash;the last is the most vital, for it imparts life so that we may live Christ.</p>
<p>In verse 20 Paul says, &ldquo;But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; In verse 23 Paul again speaks of Christ as the firstfruit. Christ was the first One raised from among the dead as the firstfruit of resurrection. This was typified by the firstfruits (a sheaf of the firstfruits, including Christ with some of the dead Old Testament saints, was raised at the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;Matt. 27:52-53) in Leviticus 23:10-11, offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, the day of resurrection (Matt. 28:1). Christ as the firstfruit of resurrection is the Firstborn from among the dead to be the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18; Eph. 1:20-23). Since He, the Head of the Body, has been resurrected, we, the Body, shall also be resurrected.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ as the Last Adam<br />
Having Become a Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>Chapter fifteen reveals not only that Christ died for our sins, that He was buried, and that He was resurrected to become the firstfruit. This chapter also reveals that Christ as the last Adam has become in resurrection a life-giving Spirit: &ldquo;So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Adam became a living soul through creation with a soulish body. Christ became a life-giving Spirit through resurrection with a spiritual body. Adam as a living soul is natural; Christ as a life-giving Spirit is resurrected. First, in incarnation, Christ became flesh for redemption (John 1:14, 29). Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life (John 10:10). He had a soulish body like Adam through incarnation; He has a spiritual body through resurrection. His soulish body has become a spiritual one through resurrection. Now He is a life-giving Spirit in resurrection, with a spiritual body, ready to be received by His believers. When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit. Hence, we become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). Our spirit is made alive and resurrected with Him. Eventually our present soulish body will also become a spiritual body in resurrection, just as His body is (vv. 52-54; Phil. 3:21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Giving Us the Victory<br />
through Our Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:57 Paul declares, &ldquo;But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This victory is the victory over sin and death. Such a victory by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection should not be merely an accomplished fact for our acceptance; it must also become our daily experience in life by the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, who is one with our spirit. Hence, we should live by this mingled spirit and walk according to it. Thus, many thanks will be continuously given to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Because we believe in Christ and participate in Him, we have an organic union with Him. As a result, we enjoy His victory over sin and death. We all have Christ as the firstfruit and as the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, we may enjoy His victory. This makes it possible for us to function in the church meetings.</p>
<p>When we enjoy Christ&rsquo;s victory, we can speak for Christ and we can speak forth Christ in the meetings. This speaking opens the way for the Spirit to function, for the Lord to minister, and for God to work. Then the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity will take place continually, and the church will receive the benefit. This is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issuing in the functions of the members in a local church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_118.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_120.html">Next</a> </body></html>
