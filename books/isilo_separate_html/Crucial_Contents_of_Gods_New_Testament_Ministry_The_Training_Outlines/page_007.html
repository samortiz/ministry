<h1 class="title">The All-inclusive Spirit&mdash;<br />
the Life-giving, Compound,<br />
Sevenfold Intensified Spirit</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God being Spirit reveals that God&rsquo;s divine substance is Spirit&mdash;John 4:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The source of the all-inclusive Spirit is God, who is Spirit.</li>
	<li>The word <em>Spirit</em> in John 4:24 does not refer to God&rsquo;s person but to God&rsquo;s nature.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the third of the Triune God&mdash;Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Spirit is the consummation and the totality of the Triune God.</li>
	<li>The Father as the source is embodied in the Son, and the Son as the embodiment of the Father is realized as the Spirit.</li>
	<li>Among the three of the Trinity, the Spirit is the most important in the sense of His being the realization, application, and reaching of the Triune God to us.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of God with the element of divinity&mdash;Gen. 1:1-2; Matt. 12:28; Rom. 8:9; 1 Cor. 2:11-12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the phrase <em>the Spirit of God, God</em> is in apposition to <em>Spirit;</em> thus, the <em>Spirit of God</em> means that God is the Spirit and the Spirit is God.</li>
	<li>In Genesis 1 the Spirit of God moved to brood over the face of the waters for the producing of life in God&rsquo;s old creation.</li>
	<li>In 1 Corinthians we see that the moving Spirit of God who moves in us, that is, dwells in us, is also the revealing Spirit who reveals to us all the things of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of Jehovah, the Spirit of the Lord, as the reaching of God in His relationship with man with the elements of the Divine Trinity&mdash;Exo. 3:6, 14-15; Judg. 3:10; Isa. 61:1; Luke 4:18; 2 Cor. 3:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Genesis 2 there is another title, <em>Jehovah,</em> because in this chapter God begins to have contact with the man created by Him.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of Jehovah is God&rsquo;s reaching of man and His care for man as the great I AM.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Holy Spirit, with the element of the holy, divine nature, of whom Jesus was begotten in Mary&mdash;Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit, He was brought forth as someone who was holy in nature just as God Himself is holy.</li>
	<li>The conception of the Lord Jesus is related to the beginning of God making Himself man and of God making man God that He might become man and man might become Him in life and nature but not in the Godhead, that the two could become one entity.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the life-giving Spirit with the impartation of the divine life&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The life-giving Spirit has the ability to give us life.</li>
	<li>The life-giving Spirit is now working in the being of the believers to give life to their whole being.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of life with the riches of the divine life&mdash;Rom. 8:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Spirit of life is the pneumatic Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of the divine life to the believers.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for this Spirit contains the element of the divine life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of reality, the Spirit of what God is, has, and does&mdash;John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Whatever the Triune God is, is ours; whatever He has, is ours; and whatever He has done, is ours by the Spirit of reality.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of reality is the linking between us and the Triune God, making us one with the Triune God in experience.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus, who is the reality of Jesus in His suffering humanity&mdash;Acts 16:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because Paul was suffering in Acts 16, the Spirit of Jesus was with him having not only the divine element of God but also the elements of humanity, human living, and crucifixion, the suffering of death.</li>
	<li>Such an all-inclusive Spirit was needed by Paul in his preaching ministry, a ministry with sufferings for the sake of the Body of Christ&mdash;Col. 1:24.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of Christ with the element of resurrection&mdash;Rom. 8:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Spirit of Christ is Christ in His divinity, who conquered death and became life in resurrection with the resurrection power.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of Christ with the element of resurrection is the death-conquering and the life-dispensing Spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ with the bountiful supply of all the elements of humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection&mdash;Phil. 1:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the Jesus who lived a life of suffering on the earth and of the Christ who is now in resurrection.</li>
	<li>In his suffering Paul experienced both the Lord&rsquo;s suffering in His humanity and the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment&mdash;Exo. 30:22-31:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The compound ointment is composed of a hin of olive oil blended and compounded with four elements&mdash;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia&mdash;with their respective units and numbers.</li>
	<li>The compound ointment typifies man and God compounded together with the sweet and effective death of Christ and the flavor and power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the Triune God, and the power for responsibility.</li>
	<li>The compound ointment is for anointing everything and every person related to God&rsquo;s worship to separate them from anything common, making them most holy for God&rsquo;s service.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Lord Spirit with the elements of ascension and lordship&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17-18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Spirit is the Lord who is the Spirit and the Spirit who is the Lord.</li>
	<li><em>The Lord Spirit</em> is a compound title referring to the pneumatic Christ.</li>
	<li>The Lord Spirit is for our transformation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the seven Spirits with the sevenfold intensification&mdash;Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The seven Spirits actually are the one Spirit of God who is sevenfold for God&rsquo;s move to carry out God&rsquo;s administration, to execute God&rsquo;s economy in the universe.</li>
	<li>Such an intensified Spirit is for us to be vitalized, to be overcomers in the degradation of the church.</li>
	<li>The seven Spirits as the eyes of Christ are observing us and transfusing us with all His riches.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit, the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God&mdash;John 7:39; Rev. 22:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God marries the bride as the consummation of the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed tripartite man.</li>
	<li>The Spirit as the consummated God and the transformed tripartite man will be married to be one heavenly, universal couple for eternity.</li>
	</ol></li>
