   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE MINISTRY AND THE MINISTERS IN 2 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:3, 6, 17-18; 4:7, 10-11, 16; 6:4-10; 11:23-29; 12:7-10; 13:14 A LIVING MINISTRY TO WRITE LIVING LETTERS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 3:3 says, "Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This word indicates that something of Christ has been wrought into people to make them living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the work of a living ministry, not that of any kind of gift.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have never seen a person who had the life of Christ wrought into him merely by a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot minister Christ into others merely by gift, teaching, word, or knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, it must be by something of Christ that has been wrought into us to make us not only the ministers of Christ but also the ministry of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We, the persons, become the living ministry of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we minister, we not only pass on the knowledge about Christ to others, but we minister Christ Himself through the word into them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This kind of ministry is one which works Christ into people so that they become the living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are composed as letters not merely by knowledge or word but of the very essence, the very element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Something of Christ Himself as the Spirit has been wrought into the life and nature of His people so that they become the living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These letters are not inscribed with ink, that is, not with the letter of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are written with the Spirit of the living God, with God Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to minister in this way, merely to have knowledge is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then when we speak, preach, and teach, the element, the essence, of the Spirit is ministered into people and wrought into people so that they become the living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>MINISTERS NOT OF THE LETTER BUT OF THE SPIRIT AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 6 says, "Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is an important principle here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not deal with the letter of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not pay attention to the mere letter, because the letter kills.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the Spirit that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Letter Killing by Being Something Other Than Life</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may not fully understand the deeper meaning of kills in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we pay attention to things other than the life of God, that is a real killing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To kill is to put life into a position of not working, to cause life to be out of function.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may feel that to bring in death is a killing, but even if we do not bring in death, simply to pay attention to things other than life is a real killing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Apparently, we may not bring in anything of death, but we may draw people's attention away from life to many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although this appears not to be death, in fact it is a real killing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For many years I was bothered by the phrase the letter kills.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To my realization, when I dealt with the letter, it seemed that I was not killed, and I had no intention to kill.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Gradually after a long time I began to understand the proper meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we say that the letter kills, it means that mere doctrine, the knowledge of the letter, causes people to pay attention to things other than life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When someone ministers, it may seem that there is nothing of death, but there may be no life there, only something other than life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may not say that this is death, but it has nothing to do with life; it is the absence of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, it is a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the correct meaning of the letter kills.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The deeper meaning of this phrase is that when we deal with things or pay attention to things other than life, that is a killing.</S>
