   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>USING OUR SPIRIT AND OUR MENTAL FACULTY TO RECEIVE THE SPIRIT AND LIFE FROM THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 2:2 tells us that we may grow by the guileless milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The term "of the word'' in Greek is logikos.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This word, in Romans 12:1 translated reasonable, is derived from the noun logos the word; hence, of the word; having the sense of pertaining to the mind in contrast with the body , to the rational faculties; hence, rational, logical, reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The milk of the word is not milk for the body, but milk for the soul, the inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is conveyed in the Word of God to nourish our inner man through the understanding of our rational mind, and is assimilated by our mental faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the nourishing milk of the word is for the soul through the mind, it eventually nourishes our spirit, making us not soulish but spiritual, suitable for building up a spiritual house for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord indicated that for giving life, He would become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we get the Spirit who is life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Scripture is the embodiment of God as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must strike the Spirit of the Scripture with our spirit to catch the divine fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A. By Pray-reading</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Pray-reading is the best way to receive the Spirit and life from the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you read the Word of God, do not read only with your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You also must use your spirit by calling and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ephesians 6:17 and 18a says, "And receive the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you read the Word of God, some word may touch you; immediately turn that into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose you are reading the above verses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may pray, "O Lord, I am here to receive the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>O Lord Jesus, You are the Spirit; I want to receive You.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit is the word of God, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As I am pray-reading your word, I am receiving Your Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am praying in my spirit to receive You through Your word.''</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you would pray like this, you will be energized by the Spirit and life, and you will be burning in your spirit by the divine fire.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. By Reading</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to read the Bible from cover to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Decide before the Lord how much you want to read every day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you read three chapters from the Old Testament and one chapter from the New Testament every day, it will take you about one year to finish the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you read one chapter from the New Testament every day, it will take you about nine months to finish the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You need to set up your goal for Bible-reading and carry it out accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As you are reading through, pray with the verses that touch you, write down what you see, then tell people around you what you wrote down.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Tell your parents, your siblings, your partners, your serving ones, and your friends.</S>
