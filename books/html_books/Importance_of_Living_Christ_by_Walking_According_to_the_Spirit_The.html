<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee to a gathering of elders in Anaheim, California, from June 22 through 25, 1982.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING ACCORDING TO THE VISION<br />
OF THE CENTRAL LANE<br />
OF PAUL'S COMPLETING MINISTRY</h1>
<p>The Lord has shown us much concerning the central lane of Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry. I believe that the revelation and vision concerning God&rsquo;s eternal purpose in the central lane of Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry has never been opened as thoroughly and as clearly as it has been opened today among us. However, it is one thing to see the vision, and it is another thing to live in the vision. We may receive the vision yet not be in the reality of the vision. Today, among the many local churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there are few problems, and the situation is pleasant and encouraging. Nevertheless, we need to realize that our living does not adequately match what we have seen. We have seen the central lane of Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry, but we do not have the living to correspond with our vision. This is a great need.</p>
<p>Since the first century the central lane of Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry has been included in the Scriptures. We thank the Lord for Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. What needs to be recovered today is mainly the things revealed in Paul&rsquo;s ministry, which is strengthened by John&rsquo;s mending ministry. John&rsquo;s ministry mentions the lampstands, which are the local churches (Rev. 1&mdash;3), but without Paul&rsquo;s ministry as a basis, we could not understand much about the church. The basic revelation concerning the church is in Paul&rsquo;s writings. Only Paul&rsquo;s Epistles reveal the great mystery&mdash;Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4; 5:32). What has been lost in the past centuries is mostly the revelation in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. Therefore, the purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery up to the present has been mainly to recover this revelation. We should not think that we already see the full revelation in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. We need to see much more. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles are like a great field that contains many riches. We still need to explore this field. The Lord used Brother Watchman Nee to lay a foundation in His recovery, and He has been going on based on that foundation.</p>
<p>We need to humble ourselves to see that there is a shortage in our daily life of a practical living according to the vision that we have seen in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles. We need to see still more of this vision, but we already see more than we are practicing in our daily living. On the one hand, we have seen something, at least doctrinally, concerning the central lane of Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry, but on the other hand, we are short of a daily living that matches what the Lord has shown us. Although we have seen something, we do not pay adequate attention to what we have seen. As leading ones, we are often distracted by outward things, such as our work or the problems in the local churches. Actually, such problems are mainly due to a lack of living Christ.</p>
<p>Our daily walk does not adequately correspond to our vision concerning the central lane of Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry. When I recently visited a church, a leading brother took me to see the church&rsquo;s new meeting hall. However, my burden is not for the churches to build meeting halls but for all the saints to live Christ. Of course, meeting halls are useful and necessary, but what the Lord wants in His recovery is not our building of halls but our living of Christ. Our primary concern should not be anything outward but whether we are living the self or living Christ.</p>
<p>We should not be satisfied with merely knowing the truth; we must also seek to experience it. Our living should not remain the same after listening to many messages. Some saints begin to talk in a secular way as soon as a meeting is dismissed. This kind of talk is like the birds in Matthew 13:4 and 19 that come to snatch away the word. Recently, based on Romans 8:4, we saw the matter of walking according to the spirit. To see this is a great help, but we need to consider whether we are daily practicing to walk according to the spirit. To walk according to the spirit is to live Christ. The Lord wants a people who have such a walk and such a living.</p>
<p>Through the years the churches have had some growth in life, yet our living of Christ is not adequate. Moreover, our growth is slow because our living is short. Our growth may be helped or frustrated by our living. Thus, we should not be satisfied to see some growth in life; we must seek to have a proper living, which will produce normal growth. Our living needs to match our vision.</p>
<p>When the leading ones meet in the various localities, they should pray and fellowship concerning their living of Christ in their daily lives. Our real responsibility is our living, and our living should be according to the spirit. As leading ones, we know from our experience that when we are living Christ, we are best able to care for the church. We must see the need for our living to match our vision.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING CHRIST AND<br />
WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 1:21; Gal. 2:20; Rom. 8:4</h1>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO WALK ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT<br />
IN ORDER TO LIVE CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the past few years we have seen the matter of living Christ (Phil. 1:21; Gal. 2:20). Recently, based on Romans 8:4, we have seen the matter of walking according to the spirit, which is the practical way to live Christ. We are often distracted from walking according to the spirit. We may be distracted even by apparently positive things, such as preaching the gospel. We need to pay our full attention to walking according to the spirit in order to live Christ.</p>
<p>The church fathers taught much about the person of Christ, but most neglected to live Christ. The more they taught about Christ, the more they were divided and fought one another because of different interpretations and doctrines. Christians have emphasized various kinds of works and teachings throughout the past nineteen centuries, but few have lived Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord has revealed much to us today, but we need to be those who earnestly desire to walk according to the spirit. As elders, we may help the saints to preach the gospel and exercise their spirits in the meetings, but our primary concern should be to help them to live Christ by walking according to the spirit in their daily life. We all need to consider our own situation. If we are honest, we will humble ourselves before the Lord and repent to Him for our lack of walking according to the spirit in our daily life.</p>
<p>When we face serious problems, we often pray desperately to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Before we give a message, it is easy to pray. However, walking according to the spirit is different from praying in difficult situations or before spiritual activities. To walk according to the spirit is to do everything in our daily life according to the spirit. We need to walk according to the spirit moment by moment, not only in big things but also in small things, such as writing a letter or talking with our family at the dinner table. If we cannot do or say something according to the spirit, we should not do or say it. We must admit that we are short of such a living. To pray only during the meetings or when we face a great problem is not to walk according to the spirit. Our walking according to the spirit in our daily living should be like our breathing. If we do not live Christ or walk according to the spirit, our spiritual activities may be a performance. We should not act one way in the meetings and another way in our daily life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING EITHER ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT<br />
OR ACCORDING TO THE FLESH</h2>
<p>When we are not walking according to the spirit in our daily life, we are walking according to the flesh. According to Romans 8:4-9, anything that is not according to the spirit is according to the flesh. There are only two sources and two conditions of our living&mdash;the spirit and the flesh. Outward behavior, such as whether we are loving or hating others or praising or criticizing others, does not determine whether we are living according to the spirit or the flesh. Even our love is according to the flesh if it is not according to the spirit. We may rarely speak negatively, but even our positive speech that is not according to the spirit is still according to the flesh.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is difficult to know the spirit, but it is easy to know what is not the spirit. For instance, we know when our speaking is not according to the spirit, even when it is positive. In order to be able to live according to the spirit, it is sufficient for us to know when our speech and actions are not according to the spirit. However, we do not practice such a life. During the meetings we may conduct ourselves according to the spirit, but after the meetings we often feel free to speak and do things according to the flesh. It is not sufficient merely to live morally or ethically or even to decide what to do based on the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, for we may be led by the Spirit to do something but then do it according to the flesh. We need to do everything according to the spirit, thinking, speaking, and acting moment by moment according to the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF A DAILY LIFE OF WALKING<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Other aspects of the Christian life, such as preaching the gospel, should be the result of our living Christ. If all the saints live Christ by walking according to the spirit, there will be a great increase in the church. Much gospel preaching will spontaneously issue from our walking according to the spirit. Several years ago I proposed that the saints in a certain locality go out at least once a week to contact others. Everyone listened and agreed, but eventually no one practiced it. I found that it does not work to charge the saints to go out regularly to preach the gospel. However, if the elders in a locality take the lead to walk according to the spirit, and they minister such a life to the other saints, the saints in that locality will also walk according to the spirit and regularly preach the gospel. When the meetings are dismissed, the saints tend to talk only with those whom they already know, and new ones are often neglected. When we choose whom we will talk to based on our natural preferences, we are not walking according to the spirit. If we have the time, strength, and desire only to do things that are according to our natural taste, it is because we are not walking according to the spirit.</p>
<p>Our primary concern should not be how to do things such as preaching the gospel and shepherding the new believers. Instead, we need to see that God wants a people who live Christ by walking according to the spirit. If we practice to continually walk according to the spirit throughout the day, everything else will spontaneously issue forth from such a living. The real impact of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery comes from our living. Our gospel preaching and shepherding should not be activities but should be the issue of a daily life of walking according to the spirit. Such a living will also issue in holiness, victory, and spirituality. All such aspects of the Christian life should be part of our living. For instance, a daily life of walking according to the spirit will issue in our functioning with a released spirit in the meetings. If we do not live Christ in our daily life, we will have no surplus of Christ to bring to the meetings. In order to exhibit Christ, we must gain Christ in our daily life by walking according to the spirit. If the saints are living Christ, they will spontaneously function in the meetings.</p>
<p>If there were no clergy or organizations for mission work or Bible teaching in Christianity but instead all the genuine believers were walking according to the spirit and living Christ, thousands would be brought to the Lord every day as a result. Moreover, the believers would spontaneously come together in every place to praise and worship the Lord. This is the situation that the Lord desires, and such a situation would have real impact. Within a short time, the entire earth would be gained for the Lord. The subtle enemy uses religious organizations and activities to distract the believers from living Christ. If the saints are helped to walk according to the spirit, the churches will be prevailing. We must not allow our religious background to distract us. We need a clear view from the heavens to see that what the Lord wants is a group of people who walk according to the spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s desire is not for many co-workers, elders, or activities, or much organization. As leading ones, we primarily need to walk according to the spirit in our daily life and help other saints to enter into this kind of living.</p>
<p>We do not need to worry about the result or practical issue of a daily life of walking according to the spirit, because genuine life spontaneously bears fruit. Life means everything. Genesis 1:27-28 says, &ldquo;God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it.&rdquo; Man filled the earth not by doing but simply by living. The way for man to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose is through a proper living. However, because God&rsquo;s enemy Satan knows this, he uses many things to distract the Lord&rsquo;s people from a proper living. Therefore, we need to come back to a daily life of living Christ and walking according to the spirit.</p>
<p>When we walk according to the spirit daily and moment by moment, the Triune God as the Spirit will have the opportunity to make His home in our entire being. This is our greatest need. We need a living to match the vision we have seen. The great teachers did not clearly see the central vision concerning living Christ. The famous book <em>The Imitation of Christ</em> by Thomas &#224; Kempis does not emphasize living Christ. Even the mystics like Madame Guyon, who saw much, did not emphasize living Christ. Today we stand on their shoulders to see and practice the matters of living Christ and walking according to the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: In my experience the most enjoyable times have been times of corporately seeking the Lord. How does the matter of living Christ relate to the corporate experience of Christ?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The corporate aspect of the Christian life is certainly helpful, but what we often lack is a daily life of walking according to the spirit. The saints in a local church may experience a high corporate life for a time, but if they do not enter into the practice of walking according to the spirit, their enjoyment will eventually diminish. Many of us have experienced a high corporate life in the past. Today we need to enter into the actual practice of walking according to the spirit, and as leading ones, we need to help others to balance their corporate enjoyment of the Lord with a personal daily life of walking according to the spirit. Whether or not there is a high atmosphere of corporate enjoyment in our locality, we need to personally walk according to the spirit. Corporate exercise of the spirit helps our walking according to the spirit but cannot replace it. Our walking according to the spirit is our spiritual breathing, which is what enables us to endure. To stop breathing is an indication of death. We need to pay our full attention to walking according to the spirit, because our breathing is what matters.</p>
<p>Many saints need to practice walking according to the spirit in order to become less dependent on corporate help. The Lord may place us in an environment in which we do not have much opportunity to meet with others. The apostle John did not receive corporate help when he was in exile on the island of Patmos, but he was still in spirit (Rev. 1:10). We need to practice to be in spirit when we are alone.</p>
<p><em>Question: Many times I have experienced being led by the Spirit to do something, but while I am doing it, I am not walking according to the spirit or living Christ. Therefore, I do not minister Christ to those I contact. Could you say something further about living Christ?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Paul could say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). We need to consider whether we can say this according to our experience. We may have this teaching and perhaps even this revelation and vision, but we must admit that we do not adequately have this living, even if we say and do many good things. Deep within we realize that it is mostly we who are living and not Christ, perhaps even when we are speaking about the Lord. This shows our lack.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the kind of people God desires to gain is a people who live Christ. Because we are still influenced by many other things, such as our background, knowledge, and environment, we miss the mark of living Christ and walking according to the spirit. Because the matter of living Christ pertains to life, which is mysterious and abstract, it is easy for us to miss and neglect this matter. Nevertheless, the Lord has shown us His desire, and He will not let us go. Once we have seen the matter of living Christ, there is nothing else to which we can give ourselves. We must practice this, pay our full attention to this, live this, and minister this to others. Living Christ and ministering such a life to others may seem to be a slow work, but it is the most effective work because it is a matter of life. Life is never defeated; it always prevails. We need to realize that any kind of organizational work will not last. We must minister life, because life endures.</p>
<p>Our lack today is a daily living of walking according to the spirit. In order to see this matter, we need to be unloaded by setting aside what we think we know. After mentioning walking according to the spirit in Romans 8:4, Paul goes on to describe such a walk. In verses 5 through 17 he does not correct the believers or give them a charge or a command; instead, he explains the genuine Christian walk, which is a walk according to the spirit. This walk involves the Spirit and our spirit, and it affects our mind and our mortal body. The Spirit is in our spirit, forming a mingled spirit, and when we walk according to this mingled spirit, life is imparted to our spirit, mind, and body (vv. 10, 6, 11). After the Triune God in Christ was processed and achieved and attained everything for His purpose, He became the life-giving, all-inclusive Spirit, who is the Spirit of God the Father, the Spirit of Christ the Son, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead (vv. 9, 11). Therefore, the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. This Spirit is in our spirit, witnessing with our spirit (v. 16). These two spirits are one. The Triune God mingles with the tripartite man in the spirit. Therefore, what we need is simply to walk according to the mingled spirit. Romans 8 does not teach that we should try to improve ourselves through ethics, morality, or religion; instead, it teaches that we need to walk according to the mingled spirit. The focus of Romans 8 is walking according to the mingled spirit, which is the practical way to live Christ. Such a living is our need today. The outward results of our work may pass away; therefore, what really counts in the eyes of God is our living of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS<br />
SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4-16; John 15:4; Gal. 2:20</h1>
<p>Romans 8:4-16 says,</p>
<p>That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit. For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit. For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace. Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be. And those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you. So then, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh; for if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For you have not received a spirit of slavery bringing you into fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father! The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF THE BIBLE BEING<br />
THE TRIUNE GOD LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS<br />
SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM</h2>
<p>We need to set aside what we think we know about Romans 8 and approach it as a new chapter. We need to consider what the focus in these verses is. Through the years many Christian teachers, such as Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis, have written concerning Romans 8. According to my knowledge, almost none of their writings touch the focus of verses 4 through 16. Many writers see that chapter 7 concerns the flesh, and chapter 8 concerns the spirit, which is in contrast with the flesh. This is right, but the spirit is not the focus of these verses. Actually, the focus of these verses is the focus of the entire Bible. Understanding the central teaching of the Bible has been a problem for centuries. Paul completed the divine revelation, and John mended, confirmed, and strengthened it more than nineteen centuries ago. Since then Christians have found many crucial points in the Bible, but the true focus has been almost entirely missed.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (John 15:4). The apostle Paul wrote, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). The focus of the entire Bible can be seen in these simple words. We need to see the fact that the Triune God lives in each of us. This fact should be not only a doctrine, revelation, or vision but also our daily experience. Because the Triune God lives in us, we can live Him. This needs to be our daily experience. Thus, the focus and central teaching of the Bible is that the Triune God desires to live in His redeemed and regenerated people so that they may live Him. This simple expression annuls all philosophy and religion. The thought that God wants to live in us so that we may live Him is like fine flour, and all the other thoughts are like leaven. Activities such as preaching the gospel and establishing churches should be the issues of our living the Triune God. However, we mainly need to see that the focus of Romans 8 and of the Bible is nothing other than God&rsquo;s desire to live in us so that we may live Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">UNDERSTANDING THE BIBLE WITH A NEW CONCEPT</h2>
<p>Although the utterance <em>God wants to live in us so that we may live Him</em> is not found in Romans 8, it is the central concept of this chapter. According to verse 9, God indwells us as the Spirit in order to make His home in us. The goal of God being the Spirit and the Spirit indwelling us is God living in us so that we may live Him. In other words, the Bible teaches us that God wants to be one with us in life and living&mdash;He lives in us, and we live Him.</p>
<p>The thought that God wants to live in us so that we may live Him may seem strange to us, even if we have studied the Bible, because this thought is new to our mind. We understand anything that we read mainly according to our preexisting vocabulary and concepts. For instance, because wives are often concerned with whether their husbands love them, when they read Ephesians 5, they may mainly notice verse 25, which says, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives.&rdquo; However, husbands may focus on verse 22, which says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands.&rdquo; These different understandings of the same chapter are based on the thoughts already occupying the minds of husbands and wives. Often when we read the Bible, we do not receive revelation but instead insert the thoughts and occupations of the self into our understanding of the Bible.</p>
<p>Once the thought enters into our mind that God wants to live in us so that we may live Him, we will be able to see and apply this focus in every portion of the Bible. For instance, we can apply this focus to Ephesians 5. A husband is able to love his wife because God, who is love, lives in him and becomes his love as he lives God. Thus, a husband&rsquo;s love for his wife should be not his own ethical virtue but the issue of God living in him. Similarly, a wife&rsquo;s submission should not be merely an ethical virtue but the issue of God living in her and her living God. We can apply this focus to every virtue mentioned in the Bible, such as humility, kindness, long-suffering, and forbearance. These should not be ethical virtues like those taught by Confucius but the expression and issue of God living in us and our living Him. Most Christian teachers have made the virtues in the Bible into ethical teachings because they have missed the focus of the Bible, which is that the Triune God, after passing through His processes and accomplishing everything necessary for the fulfilling of His eternal purpose, became the Spirit in order to enter into man and live in man so that man may live Him.</p><h2 class="head1">ROMANS 8 REVEALING THAT<br />
THE SPIRIT AS THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION AND APPLICATION OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD<br />
LIVES IN US SO THAT WE MAY LIVE HIM</h2>
<p>The Spirit is not only the Spirit of God but also God Himself. According to the original Greek, in terms such as <em>the love of God,</em> the words <em>love</em> and <em>God</em> are in apposition, indicating that God is love. God&rsquo;s love does not exist independently of God Himself. Thus, the term <em>the Spirit of God</em> indicates that the Spirit is God (Rom. 8:9). Furthermore, John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; God here is the complete Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The traditional teaching concerning the Trinity implies that only God the Spirit is Spirit. However, the Bible reveals that the entire Triune God is Spirit. One of the last titles of the divine person in the Bible is <em>the Spirit</em> (Rev. 22:17). It is not merely the Spirit who speaks with the bride but the entire Triune God.</p>
<p>After passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, glorification, and enthronement and having accomplished, attained, and obtained everything necessary for His purpose, the Triune God became the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit (John 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45b). Thus, the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. As such a Spirit, the Triune God lives in us, and we live Him. All these matters can be found in Romans 8. Verses 9 and 11 present a threefold Spirit&mdash;the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead. This is the triune Spirit of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Because the Spirit enables God to reach and be applied to us, we may also say that the Spirit is the reaching and application of the Triune God. The current of electricity is electricity itself&mdash;electricity moving and being applied. If electricity were not a current, it could not reach or be applied to our homes and businesses. Thus, the current of electricity is the reaching and application of electricity. Similarly, the Spirit is God Himself moving to reach us and be applied to us. As the reaching and application of the Triune God to us, the Spirit is God Himself. This shows the shortcoming of the traditional teachings concerning the Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD LIVING IN US<br />
AND OUR LIVING HIM ISSUING IN<br />
A LIFE FULL OF VIRTUES<br />
AND MEETING ALL THE NEEDS</h2>
<p>Romans 8 reveals that the Triune God as the Spirit lives in us so that we may live Him. When we live Him, He becomes everything to us: our gospel preaching, our shepherding, and our virtues, such as lowliness, meekness, long-suffering, love, truthfulness, kindness, tenderheartedness, forgiveness, compassion, bearing one another, thankfulness, subjection, and obedience, which are mentioned in Ephesians 4 and Colossians 3. Every virtue in the Bible is the issue of the indwelling God.</p>
<p>Before I was saved, I wondered if there was a difference between the virtues taught by Confucius and the virtues taught by the Bible. Now I know that there is a great difference. The virtues taught by Confucius are the development of our natural God-created humanity, but the virtues taught in the New Testament are the issue of God living in us and our living God. When God lives in us and we live Him, He comes forth as our virtues. Our patience and humility toward others should be God. Although we have known and taught for years that Christ is the reality of every virtue, we need to realize that this is a matter of God living in us and our living Him. This is the focal point of the Bible&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s living in us so that we may live Him is a great salvation. If all the genuine Christians in a region begin to live this way, the entire region will be turned to God without any need for organizations. When God lives in us and we live, express, and flow out God, many things will come forth, such as gospel preaching, ministering of life, shepherding, edifying, humility, kindness, long-suffering, and oneness. There will be no opinions, dissension, or any such problems in the churches, for everyone will be directly governed by God as He lives in them and they live Him. This is what God wants.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING DISTRACTED<br />
FROM THE TRIUNE GOD LIVING IN US<br />
SO THAT WE MAY LIVE HIM</h2>
<p>We should not reason in the realm of right and wrong. To be right is worth nothing if we are dead. It is better to be living and wrong than right and dead. The church life is not a matter of whether we are right or wrong but a matter of whether we are living ourselves or living God. A brother recently showed me the new building project of a certain local church. However, my concern is not primarily in what the saints are doing but in whom they are living. What matters is not what we are doing but who is living. When we see this, we should not quit our service in the church, for we may still be living ourselves when we quit. We simply need to consider whether we are living ourselves or living God. If the leading brothers see this focus of the Bible and begin to live God, many other saints will be brought into this kind of living, and there will be a wonderful and spontaneous issue.</p>
<p>We should not allow anything to be a distraction from the Triune God living in us so that we may live Him. The primary burden of the elders and co-workers should be to live God. Matthew 7:21-23 says, &ldquo;Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power? And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.&rdquo; Here the word <em>knew</em> in Greek implies approval. If we do not live God as we are working today, the Lord will not approve our work.</p>
<p>We need to live the Triune God by allowing Him to indwell us, make His home in us, and take full possession of our being and by walking according to the mingled spirit. When we see, appreciate, and practice this, the law of the Spirit of life will operate within us, our mind will spontaneously be set on the things of Christ, and our natural being with its strengths, habits, and practices will spontaneously be put to death. This is Romans 8&mdash;the Triune God living in us and our living the Triune God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS<br />
SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:4; Gal. 2:20; Rom. 8:4</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, shame Your enemy. We trust in Your blood to cover us. Under the covering of Your blood we stand against the enemy and enjoy You. Lord, anoint us. We need to see more of You. Show us Your way&mdash;the way in life and the spirit. Lord, show us that You are living in us, and show us how to live You. By Your mercy and grace, cause us to see the things concerning Your economy.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider the focus of the Bible, which can be found in John 15:4 and Galatians 2:20. In John 15:4 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo; In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; We may be familiar with these simple words, yet we need to realize that they convey a profound revelation that has been greatly neglected.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS BEING BRANCHES<br />
OF CHRIST, WHO IS THE EMBODIMENT<br />
OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was with His disciples for three and a half years and gave them many messages, including His word in Matthew 5&mdash;7. The last message that the Lord gave to His disciples before His crucifixion is recorded in John 14&mdash;16, and the focus of this last message is in chapter 15, which uses the illustration of the vine. In verse 5 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.&rdquo; A picture is better than a thousand words. These words are simple, but their significance is profound.</p>
<p>No other portion in the Bible defines and describes the Trinity in as much detail as John 14&mdash;16 does. John 14:7-11 reveals that the Father is one with the Son, for the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son. In other words, the Son is the Father&rsquo;s embodiment and expression. Verses 16 through 20 tell us that the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son. The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit. These three are one. Then in chapter 15 we see that the Son is the vine, and the Father is the husbandman (v. 1). Verse 26 mentions the Spirit of reality again. Chapter 16 continues to reveal the Trinity. The Son has been given all that the Father has, and the Spirit reveals and conveys to us all that the Son is (vv. 13-15). Thus, the Spirit conveys to us the entire Triune God&mdash;the Spirit comes with the Son and with the Father.</p>
<p>The vine is Christ the Son, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. As branches in the vine, the believers are members of Christ (Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:12, 27; Eph. 5:30). The vine in John 15 is the universal new man, of which Christ is the Head and all the believers are the members (Eph. 2:15). Because the believers are branches of Christ, who embodies the Triune God, we may also say that the believers are the branches of the Triune God. We branch out the Triune God.</p>
<p>To teach that we branch out the Triune God according to John 15 is not to teach that we are God as an object of worship. Because we were born of Adam, we are the branches of Adam. When we have children, we continue to branch out Adam. We began as branches of Adam, but we were grafted into Christ (Rom. 11:24). This grafting was another birth. John 1:12 says, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.&rdquo; Because we have been born of God, we are the offspring of God. As such, we should branch out God. If we walk according to the flesh, we branch out Adam, but if we walk according to the spirit, we branch out God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; LIVING OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
ISSUING IN ALL THE OTHER EXPERIENCES<br />
OF THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>In John 15 the Lord charges us only to abide in Him (v. 4). All the life and activity of the branches come from their abiding in the vine. As long as the branches abide in the vine, the leaves, blossoms, and fruit will spontaneously come forth. Therefore, the Lord emphasized not fruit-bearing but abiding. The crucial point is our abiding in Christ. We do not need to struggle to bear fruit, for fruit-bearing is an issue of our abiding in Christ. As long as we abide in Christ, the other experiences of the normal Christian life will automatically follow. Therefore, our unique need is to abide in Christ.</p>
<p>The mutual abiding of the vine and the branches depicts the Triune God living in us so that we may live Him. The revelation in John 15 is essentially the same as that in Romans 8. Both reveal the focus of the universe and the center of the Bible&mdash;the Triune God lives in us so that we may live Him. This should also be the focus of our Christian life.</p>
<p>All we need to do is to live the Triune God; everything else will be a spontaneous issue of our living the Triune God. However, nearly all Christians, including the great teachers, have missed this focus. The teachings of Thomas &#224; Kempis and Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis concerning bearing the cross, experiencing the subjective death of Christ, and following Jesus outside the camp have been influential among many seeking Christians but have erroneously led some to asceticism. Other teachings emphasize the resurrection life, subjective sanctification, or holiness, and the victorious life. For instance, an American brother, Charles G. Trumbull, wrote a book called <em>The Life That Wins</em> concerning the victorious life. Many books have been written concerning these matters and have influenced countless seeking Christians during the past few centuries. In my early Christian life I studied and was influenced by these books. I endeavored to bear the cross, experience the subjective death of Christ, follow Jesus outside the camp, and exercise faith to experience the resurrection life. I saw that these mystical teachings are higher than the merely ethical teachings of fundamental Protestantism. However, I eventually discovered that the practices taught by the mystics are based on human effort and are therefore ineffective. I also tried experiencing the spiritual gifts as practiced by the Pentecostals, such as speaking in tongues, and discovered that their practices were ineffective as well.</p>
<p>The experiences of the subjective death of Christ, the resurrection life, and the spiritual gifts are scriptural, but these experiences should be the spontaneous issue of the Triune God living in us and our living Him. We may use our physical body as an illustration. If our heart is not pumping, we cannot cause our members to function artificially. However, if our heart is pumping, we do not need to teach the nose to breathe, the ears to listen, or the eyes to see, for all our members will function spontaneously. The &ldquo;heart&rdquo; of the Christian life is the Triune God living in us and our living Him. As long as we live the Triune God by walking according to the spirit, all the other experiences of the normal Christian life, such as bearing the cross and participating in the resurrection life, will spontaneously come forth.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR UNIQUE NEED BEING TO WALK<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT,<br />
WHICH IS OUR REGENERATED HUMAN SPIRIT<br />
INDWELT BY AND MINGLED WITH THE SPIRIT,<br />
THE CONSUMMATION OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Romans presents a sketch of the Christian life. In chapter 8, which is the heart of Romans, verse 4 charges us to walk according to the spirit. The spirit in this verse is our regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.&rdquo; This shows that these two spirits are one.</p>
<p>The Triune God in Christ has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Furthermore, Christ has attained to the throne and has obtained the kingdom, the highest name, the lordship, and the headship. The Triune God in Christ has been processed through all these steps and accomplishments and has become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Romans 8 shows us that the life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God. Verse 2 mentions the Spirit of life, which is the life-giving Spirit. Verses 9 and 11 refer to the Spirit as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead. Thus, the life-giving Spirit is the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God. This Spirit is one with our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</p>
<p>God created us with a spirit so that we could contact and receive Him. However, because of the fall, our spirit was deadened. At the time of our salvation, our spirit was made alive as the Spirit came into our spirit and regenerated it with the divine life. Now our spirit is indwelt by and mingled with the Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God. Since we have such a wonderful mingled spirit within us, our unique need is to walk according to this spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO ABIDE IN THE VINE BY WALKING<br />
ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE WAY TO LIVE THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>The vine is Christ, who has become the life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God. Therefore, to abide in the vine is to walk according to the mingled spirit. Our experience tells us that as long as we walk according to the spirit, all the other experiences of the normal Christian life, such as bearing the cross and participating in the power of the resurrection life, will spontaneously issue forth. We do not need to endeavor or exercise our human effort. We need only to walk according to the mingled spirit, which is the practical way to live God and to allow God to live in us.</p>
<p>Romans 8:9 says that the Spirit dwells in us. When we walk according to the spirit, we allow the Triune God to make His home in, settle down in, take possession of, and occupy our entire inner being. If we allow the Triune God to indwell us in this way, we will spontaneously and continually experience the killing of the death of Christ. This is not asceticism, for it is joyful and kills only the negative, natural elements in us. The focus of the Bible and of the Christian life is not to experience the subjective death of Christ; the unique focus is to live God.</p>
<p>According to my fifty years of experience, I can testify that if we are not living God, no other practices work, for they are matters of our own effort. Some may point out that walking according to the spirit also requires effort. This is true, but it is a small effort, and it is effective, for all the other experiences of the normal Christian life will result. Thus, the effort of walking according to the spirit may be compared to the effort of turning on a light switch in order to light a large room, which is more effective than lighting many separate lamps. God made us with a mind to understand and a will to choose. We have to use these faculties to live the Christian life. Even our initial believing in the Lord for our eternal salvation requires our effort to understand the gospel and choose to believe. However, this does not mean that we save ourselves by our own effort. We do not need to exert much effort to produce the experiences of the normal Christian life. Instead, we need only to walk according to the spirit&mdash;the other experiences will spontaneously follow.</p>
<p>In a sense, it is difficult to know when we are walking according to the spirit, but it is easy to know when we are not walking according to the spirit. When our body functions normally, we do not have much feeling. We do not sense that our stomach is digesting normally. If we feel our stomach, this means that something is abnormal. Similarly, as long as we are walking according to the spirit, we will live a normal Christian life without much feeling. However, we have a clear negative feeling when we are not walking according to the spirit so that we know to stop and turn to the spirit.</p>
<p>The focus of the Bible is that the processed Triune God lives in us so that we may live Him. Our need is simply to live Him by walking according to the spirit. We have a mingled spirit, which is composed of our regenerated spirit and the all-inclusive Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God. If we walk according to this wonderful mingled spirit, every other experience of the normal Christian life will spontaneously come forth. All the saints today need this kind of life. We need to take the lead to pursue a daily life of walking according to the mingled spirit so that we can minister such a life to others.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 4:5; 8:1-2, 4, 6-7, 9; 1 Cor. 15:10; Gal. 2:20; Matt. 20:26-27; 23:11-12; 1 Tim. 1:3</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE, WHICH IS THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS<br />
SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM,<br />
BEING VERSUS LEGALISTIC OUTWARD PRACTICES</h2>
<p>The central lane of the divine revelation in the Bible is the Triune God living in the believers so that they may live Him. However, in a sense, the Bible has many complications. For instance, Acts 2:44 records that after the day of Pentecost the first believers had all things common. This practice was not a legality (5:4), nor did it continue for the long run (11:29). Nevertheless, the brief record in Acts of this early practice has become a distraction to some Christians and has been misused as a basis for promoting mandatory communal living among certain groups. The focus of God&rsquo;s economy is not communal living but the Triune God living in the believers so that they may live Him. Moreover, our living of God does not require a legalistic communal living.</p>
<p>The practice of having all things common became a distraction and cause of murmuring among the early Christians (6:1), and it ended even before the ministry of the apostle Paul began. Paul was commissioned to complete the word of God (Col. 1:25), and he does not teach or even mention this practice. Instead, he says, &ldquo;Concerning the collection for the saints...on the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered&rdquo; (1 Cor. 16:1-2). In 2 Corinthians 8:7 he says, &ldquo;Just as you abound in everything...abound in this grace also.&rdquo; Grace here refers to the act of love shown in the giving of material things to the needy saints. The believers&rsquo; grace was the issue of God&rsquo;s grace, which was motivating them. In the fellowship concerning the ministry to the saints, the apostle refers to the grace of four parties: (1) the grace of God, which was given to the Macedonian believers to motivate them and enable them to give with liberality (vv. 1-2); (2) the grace of the apostles, which allowed the believers to participate in the ministry to the needy saints (v. 4); (3) the grace of the believers, which was their ministering of material things to the needy ones (vv. 6-7); and (4) the grace of Christ, that He became poor that we might become rich (v. 9). This indicates that the believers&rsquo; offering of material possessions to the Lord for any purpose should be absolutely a matter of grace, not of human maneuvering.</p>
<p>Grace is powerful. In a sense, to have a legalistic communal living is easy, although complaints and murmurings will soon arise. However, to faithfully set aside a portion of God&rsquo;s material blessing for His needs requires grace, which is the Triune God enjoyed by us. The focus of God&rsquo;s economy in the Bible is the Triune God living in us so that we may live Him. Paul says, &ldquo;I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:10). This verse expresses the same thought as Galatians 2:20, which says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; <em>Not I but the grace of God</em> means &ldquo;I cannot do it; it is not I but the Triune God who lives in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeking Christians are easily attracted to communal living. However, this practice is not what God desires. What He desires is to live in the believers so that they may live Him practically to the extent that they desire to give financially to Him. To faithfully set aside a portion of our income for the Lord requires grace. To make any long-term sacrifice, such as Brother Watchman Nee&rsquo;s twenty years imprisonment, requires the Triune God living in us and our living Him.</p>
<p>The matters of material giving and communal living show that it is easy for us to be distracted from the central lane of the Bible, even by other things in the Bible. We need to realize that no practice will last long if it is not based on the Triune God living in us and our living Him. God&rsquo;s intention is not to have a group of people living together and having all things common. We should not be distracted from the central lane of the Bible. God&rsquo;s desire is for a people who live Him. As long as we live God, He will spontaneously lead us to give when it is proper. Our living of God balances us. To impose outward regulations is easy, but to live a balanced life requires the Triune God as grace to us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS<br />
SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM<br />
BEING VERSUS HUMAN ORGANIZATION,<br />
HIERARCHY, AND CONTROL</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention cannot be fulfilled merely by our good works, such as baptizing new believers or raising up churches. God&rsquo;s unique desire is for a people who live Him. Because most Christians have missed this focus, today&rsquo;s Christianity is mainly a matter of doctrines, regulations, rituals, forms, organizations, and hierarchies, including many positions, titles, and ranks. Even many who have left the denominations to meet as local churches are still under the influence of organized Christianity.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul did not appoint a successor. Timothy was his fellow worker and child in the Lord but not his designated successor (Rom. 16:21; 1 Cor. 4:17). Timothy is not prominent in history because he did not succeed Paul as one who wrote Epistles and cared for all the Gentile churches. The genuine spiritual giants in history have not had successors. Neither C. H. Spurgeon nor J. N. Darby chose successors. Only the Lord can raise up someone to continue His work. The fallen thought of having a successor in the Lord&rsquo;s work is due to distraction from the central lane of the divine revelation in the Bible.</p>
<p>All the regulations, rituals, organizations, and hierarchies in Christianity have come into being because God&rsquo;s people have been distracted from the central lane of His revelation in the Bible. After many saints moved from Los Angeles to Anaheim in 1974, a subtle system of hierarchical organization came in through so-called service groups. When I became aware of this, I strongly advised the elders to give up this system and to instead allow the saints to serve as they are led by the Spirit. The elders received my word, and that system was removed. The Lord&rsquo;s way and His unique desire are to live in His people so that they may live Him. The leading ones need to take the lead to live Him and to minister Him into the saints so that all the saints may live Him. We must reject all the things that have come in to distract God&rsquo;s people from His focus. The principle of Babylon is to reject God and instead rely on human hierarchy and organization. We must be careful to avoid this principle.</p>
<p>The elders should not consider that they have an elevated position or any authority in themselves. The Lord said, &ldquo;Whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave&rdquo; (Matt. 20:26-27). He also said, &ldquo;The greatest among you shall be your servant. And he who will exalt himself shall be humbled, and he who will humble himself shall be exalted&rdquo; (23:11-12). Every elder and co-worker should consider himself simply as a brother. The word <em>apostle</em> in Greek means &ldquo;a sent one.&rdquo; Therefore, whoever goes out with the gospel is an apostle sent by God. The co-workers and elders do not have higher positions than others; they are only servants. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:5, &ldquo;We do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&rsquo; sake.&rdquo; This was Paul&rsquo;s spirit. Only Christ is the Lord and the Head. No one else has authority over others. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should not agree that anyone has authority in himself. We must remember that there is only one thing that counts and only one thing that God wants&mdash;our living of Him.</p>
<p>If all the believers in a region live Christ by walking according to the spirit, their living will be a preaching of the gospel with great impact. There will be no need to organize the rapidly growing number of believers, because the believers will spontaneously gather in each locality as local churches. In large cities of several million, groups of believers may gather separately, but these groups will be one with all the other similar groups in each city and will not claim to be separate churches but merely various gatherings of the one church in that locality. Thus, there is no need for organization or hierarchy. If we care about rank and hierarchy, this proves that our view is off. Genuine local churches are not organized and hierarchical but spontaneous and organic.</p>
<p>We need to see what a local church is. First, a local church is all the genuine believers in a locality. Second, in a local church, there is no organization, position, or hierarchical rank. It is wrong to think that the elders have a special rank or are a special class among the saints. If anything, the elders should consider themselves to be lower than the other saints because they are the servants of the saints.</p>
<p>Many believers are not meeting on the proper ground of locality, but they are all still members of the local churches. We should not become a sect by considering that we are special and that those who are not meeting with us are inferior. All the believers are our dear brothers and sisters. We should never use the term <em>local church</em> with capital letters to separate ourselves from other believers. Whenever believers gather simply as believers, that is a gathering of the local church in that city. There is no organizational requirement for a group to be part of a local church.</p>
<p>If we are concerned about who will be the head of such spontaneous groups of believers, our view is off. In the church there is only one Head&mdash;Christ. None of us is a head. Our position is to be under Christ, who is our unique Head. We should not exercise authority over others, because we do not have the position to do this. We should follow the example of Paul, who did not preach himself but Christ Jesus as Lord, and himself as the slave of the saints. It is not easy for the elders to consider themselves as slaves. Because we are all fallen and have the fallen nature, we desire to have a title and a position to control and rule over others. However, if we truly live Christ by walking according to the spirit, we will not have this desire.</p>
<p>If an elder seeks to control the church in his locality, he is not walking according to the spirit. My ministry supplies hundreds of churches, but I do not control anyone. I do not answer letters that ask me to say something in a controlling way. I know only to labor for the churches by ministering the living Christ to the saints. I do not desire to control anyone. It is a great shame to control others, and it proves that the controlling one is not walking according to the spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s return may be delayed because of the church&rsquo;s condition. For the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, the elders in the local churches must see that human authority, headship, and control are wrong. We must reject all the false replacements of the one thing that is real and that counts&mdash;the Triune God living in us so that we may live Him. These replacements include doctrines, rituals, forms, and hierarchical positions and titles. Nothing matters or will last other than the Triune God living in us and our living Him. We must refuse hierarchy, self-assumed authority, and human organization and care only for God&rsquo;s desire and the focus of His revelation in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT TEACHING DIFFERENTLY</h2>
<p>We also should not teach differently. Paul wrote to Timothy, &ldquo;I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:3). To teach different things does not mean to teach heresy but to teach things different from the apostles&rsquo; ministry. Since the time of the first apostles, the unique ministry in the Body of Christ has ministered Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God who became the Spirit to produce His Body. This is the only thing that we should teach. If we teach differently, different ministries will eventually emerge and produce sects and divisions. Every denomination has its own ministry, but Peter, Paul, and the other apostles had only one ministry. I do not mean that every speaking brother has to repeat my exact words. Nevertheless, we all have to see one thing&mdash;that the goal of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God to be our life and who is the Spirit to live within us and make us His living members so that His Body will be built up on the earth. This is the unique New Testament ministry.</p>
<p>It will take thousands to carry out this unique ministry. Therefore, many brothers need to participate, but we must be vigilant lest we be distracted from the central revelation that the Triune God desires to live in us so that we may live Him. If we truly live Him, human organization and hierarchy will disappear. All the positive things will issue from such a living, and all the negative things will be swallowed up by such a living. Thus, everything depends on our living. If we are not living Christ, the more we do, the more we are in danger of being distracted. The only thing that can keep us and preserve us is to see and practice the vision that God wants to live in us so that we may live Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">NEEDING TO HAVE A PROPER VIEW<br />
OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:33b; 2 Cor. 4:5; Rev. 1:1, 9; Matt. 23:11-12; 1 Pet. 5:1-3</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCHES BELONGING<br />
TO GOD AND TO THE SAINTS&mdash;<br />
THE APOSTLES AND ELDERS BEING<br />
SLAVES AND PATTERNS</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14:33b says, &ldquo;As in all the churches of the saints.&rdquo; The expression <em>the churches of the saints</em> is used only once in the New Testament. The expression <em>the church of God</em> is more common (1:2; 10:32). Nowhere in the New Testament do we hear of churches of the apostles or churches of the elders. This is because the churches do not belong to the apostles or the elders but only to God and the saints. There is a different concept among many Christians. Missionaries often refer to the churches that they establish as their churches. Some pastors consider that the churches they serve are their possessions. This is unscriptural. The churches do not belong to missionaries or pastors. We need to be purified from any consideration that a church we raise up or serve is our possession.</p>
<p>Because Paul had to vindicate his ministry, he often began his Epistles by saying, &ldquo;Paul, an apostle&rdquo; (e.g., 2 Cor. 1:1; Gal. 1:1; Eph. 1:1). However, this does not mean that Paul considered that, as an apostle, he was higher than the other believers. Second Corinthians 4:5 shows that Paul and the other apostles considered themselves to be merely slaves to serve the saints. When John wrote Revelation, he did not call himself an apostle, although he was the last of the original apostles still alive. Revelation 1:1 says, &ldquo;The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John.&rdquo; Verse 9 says, &ldquo;I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus.&rdquo; John only says that he is a slave and a brother. No matter how much the Lord uses the elders and co-workers, they must consider themselves only as slaves and brothers.</p>
<p>In Matthew 23:11-12 the Lord taught, &ldquo;The greatest among you shall be your servant. And he who will exalt himself shall be humbled, and he who will humble himself shall be exalted.&rdquo; We should not desire to be great. If we are great, we will be a servant. The more we serve as a slave, the greater we will be. The leading ones in the churches and those who serve in the work must be careful not to consider themselves to be higher or more important than others. If we consider ourselves to be higher than others, we have fallen into the snare of Satan, who rebelled against God because of his desire to be exalted (Isa. 14:13-14).</p>
<p>First Peter 5:1-2 says, &ldquo;The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory to be revealed: Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God; not by seeking gain through base means but eagerly.&rdquo; <em>Base</em> means &ldquo;low,&rdquo; and <em>gain</em> refers to money. Peter wrote this because some elders at his time had this kind of greediness. We should not have any thought of making money through the church; instead, we should be eager to help the saints and take care of their needs.</p>
<p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;allotments&rdquo; means &ldquo;lots, portions.&rdquo; The churches being the elders&rsquo; allotments does not mean that the churches are their possessions. As the flock of God, the churches are God&rsquo;s possession, but God has allotted them to the elders for their care. As elders, we should not lord it over the portions that God has assigned to us; instead, we should be examples to the flock. The elders should take the lead not by being lords but by being examples of how to care for and serve others. A flock of sheep always follows the first two or three sheep to move. Thus, the first few sheep are in the lead, walking ahead as the rest of the flock follows. The elders should take the lead in this way, going ahead as examples. Whenever the church needs to do something, the elders must do it first. This includes preaching the gospel, shepherding others, and carrying out the practical services. By establishing an example, the elders open the way for the rest of the saints to follow. The elders are the patterns of the flock.</p>
<p>According to the verses above, the apostles and the elders do not have exalted positions in the church. The apostles are slaves to the churches, serving the churches, and the elders should be patterns, not lords. The apostles and elders are simply brothers. In Matthew 23:8 the Lord said, &ldquo;Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.&rdquo; <em>Rabbi</em> is a title of honor meaning &ldquo;teacher, master.&rdquo; The business office of the church should not be like a secular business office; the elders and the serving ones are not the bosses and employees. This will not be the situation if we are walking according to the spirit. We need to realize that in the church there is only one Head, Christ. If we are a deacon, deaconess, or elder in a local church, we are not the boss; we are nothing. The concept that some in the church service are bosses and that others are employees is worldly and fleshly.</p>
<p>The church should not have any human organization or hierarchy. These secular elements are contrary to the nature of the church. Because we are under the influence of Christianity, religion, and culture, we tend to appreciate hierarchy. However, in the church there are no ranks or levels. All the saints are on the same level. This is why Paul says, &ldquo;The churches of the saints&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:33b). The elders are not higher than others. In a sense, the elders are lower than the other saints because the elders are slaves. It is ugly if an elder tries to be a lord or king to rule the church. If we walk according to the spirit, we will not behave as a king.</p>
<p>The elders should not merely assign tasks to other serving ones but should take the lead to carry out the services in order to establish a pattern. Some may think that cleaning the meeting hall is not the function of the elders. However, according to this concept, washing the feet of the disciples was not the function of the Son of God. As God&rsquo;s anointed One, Christ came to accomplish redemption, but He did not use this status as a basis to command others to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet (John 13:5). Instead, He did this first in order to establish a pattern for the disciples to follow (vv. 14-15). Similarly, the elders should not use their eldership or their spiritual capacity as a basis to give orders to others.</p>
<p>This word may seem to be basic, or elementary, but if the elders consistently practice to be a pattern in all the services of the church, the church will be greatly built up and revived. A great revival came to the church in Chefoo in 1942, not through a conference but through my establishing a pattern in the practical service in the church. I did everything, including cleaning the restrooms and arranging the deacons&rsquo; office. Through that kind of service, the revival came in. I was not a boss but a slave working from morning to evening every day. I paused only for meals and a brief rest. If there was a meeting in the evening, I attended the meeting and functioned according to the need. If there was not a meeting, I continued to carry out the practical services until late at night. If the elders will be like this, the church will be uplifted. The church may be in a low condition because the elders are bossy. In the church life no one is on a throne. The church is the Body of Christ expressed as groups of believers who love the Lord and walk according to the spirit. There should be no position, rank, title, or ambition.</p>
<p>I labored full time in Chefoo for many years. However, when the Lord led me to move to another locality, I did not have to meet with the elders and serving ones in Chefoo to make arrangements and transfer things to them, because nothing was in my hand. Today I live in Anaheim, but the church in Anaheim is not my church. Nothing pertaining to the church is in my hand. The elders should never try to make the church in their locality their private possession. Everything pertaining to the church should be open to all the saints. The church does not belong to the elders; it is the church of the saints. The things of the church should not be kept secret or confidential by the elders. The church cannot be living or revived if it is the possession of an elder or if an elder considers himself to be the boss. No elder should make the final decisions alone.</p>
<p>The elders should not consider themselves to be higher than others, and they need to see that the church belongs to God and to all the saints. The elders are only brothers and slaves to serve and work for the saints. Nothing is their private possession. If an elder needs to move from his locality, he should not need to meet with the other serving ones to hand things over to them. This is not a demand or regulation but a crucial principle. In principle, all the affairs of the church should be open to all the saints, and all the saints should bear the responsibility for the church. The church belongs to the saints, and the elders are merely serving ones. If we apply this principle, the church will be revived.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOCAL CHURCH BEING<br />
ALL THE BELIEVERS IN A LOCALITY</h2>
<p>In order for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to go on, we also need to see that the local churches are not only the believers who are meeting with us on the proper ground of oneness. The universal church is all the believers throughout time and space, and the local church is all the believers in a locality. Many genuine believers will remain in the denominations, but they are still part of the local churches. The term <em>local church</em> should not be capitalized to indicate any particular group or entity. Any group of believers who come together to worship God according to Scripture without any division is a local church.</p>
<p>We should not think that only those who come to our meetings are the local church. All the genuine believers in our city are the members of the church in our locality. Whether they come to our meetings does not determine whether they are members of the church. Some members of a family may not stay in the family&rsquo;s home, but they are still counted as part of the family. Similarly, we must see that all the believers are our brothers and sisters in the Lord and are members of the church. Otherwise, we become sectarian. The denominations count only those who meet with them as their members. However, we do not consider that only those who meet with us are members of the local church. We believe that all the believers are members of the local churches. Whether or not they meet with us, we still consider them as our brothers and sisters. Brother Watchman Nee helped us to see this when I first went to Shanghai in 1933. He taught us that all the believers, including Roman Catholics who are truly saved, are our brothers and sisters.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING THE BODY LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4; 12:4-5</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY LIFE ISSUING FROM<br />
WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Body of Christ in Romans 12 issues from the experience of walking according to the spirit in Romans 8. According to Paul&rsquo;s view of God&rsquo;s economy, all the members of the Body of Christ should be persons who walk according to the spirit. In principle, if we do not walk according to the spirit, we cannot practically have the Body of Christ. All the believers are members of the Body of Christ, but the practicality of the Body depends on the believers&rsquo; walk. If the believers walk according to the flesh, although they are still members of the Body of Christ, there will be no Body in their experience. The Body life is annulled by a fleshly walk. There are millions of believers today, but there is very little of the Body life among them, because few walk according to the spirit. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, the situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is somewhat better, yet we have to admit that even among us the Body life is lacking. We may have living meetings and stand on the proper ground of oneness, but the Body life among us is inadequate.</p>
<p>The Body life does not depend on the exercise of the spirit in the meetings but on the walk, the daily living, of the saints. The exercise of the spirit to sing, pray, and speak in the meetings helps the saints to live the Body life, but we need to realize that these things themselves are not the Body life. It is wrong to think that if we have a high meeting, we have the Body life. I have participated in many high meetings. During a revival in the church in Chefoo, the meetings were full of the Spirit. In some of the meetings the Spirit caused all the attendees to spontaneously weep. An older brother who visited those meetings was a director of the college where I had studied and a founder of an independent Chinese denomination. He had visited our meetings before but had not come out of the denominations. However, his children were in the church in Chefoo and strongly encouraged him to come and see what was happening when the revival began. After some time, he came. There were a few hundred saints in the first meeting that he attended, and all were spontaneously weeping. This older brother later testified that when he entered the meeting, he immediately began to weep. He could not control his tears. Afterward, he came the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in spite of the discouragement from his Christian friends, who were leaders in the denominations. Eventually, he became an elder of the church in Hong Kong. The meetings during the revival in Chefoo were so powerful that anyone who entered could not resist the Spirit, but that was not the Body life. The Body life comes from walking according to the spirit.</p>
<p>No one can deny that the revival in Chefoo was of the Lord, yet a revival is not the Body life. Revival is something temporary, but the Body life is lasting. A great revival began in Wales in 1904 through the ministry of Evan Roberts. That revival affected all of Wales, but it soon ended. This again shows that revival is not the Body life. What the Lord wants today is not to start a revival but to recover the Body life, the realization and living of the Body of Christ. In the revival in Chefoo all the saints&mdash;about eight hundred brothers and sisters&mdash;consecrated themselves, their families, and their possessions. They physically brought their belongings to the meeting hall, including the title deeds to their houses, to offer to the church. During that time we had everything in common. However, of those eight hundred saints, perhaps half have left the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Only those who walked according to the spirit remained in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>As elders, we must see that our work should be to take the lead to walk according to the spirit and to minister such a life to the saints whom we serve. If this is not our work, whatever we do will be in vain. I have never before or since seen a revival like the one in Chefoo. There were meetings every day for a hundred days, and every meeting was living and high. All eight hundred saints did not care for anything else. They had only one desire&mdash;to be prepared to be sent out as the army of the Lord. Afterward, for the sake of the gospel seventy migrated by boat to Inner Mongolia, and thirty migrated by boat to Andong in southern Manchuria. In spite of that great revival, only those who walked according to the spirit remained in the church life. Some even went back to the world. Therefore, the work of revival is altogether not trustworthy. I have learned this lesson.</p>
<p>I do not trust in any kind of revival work or in the release of the spirit in the meetings. This does not mean that I do not appreciate these things. I like to see the saints releasing their spirits, but I do not trust in it. In 1968 four couples in a certain church wanted to begin practicing pray-reading in the meetings, but the rest of the church opposed it. I encouraged the four couples not to insist on pray-reading in the meetings but to practice it at home. Today two of the couples are still in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and two have left. Practices such as pray-reading, calling on the name of the Lord, singing, and praising are helpful, and revival helps as well. However, we should not trust in these things. Many who have released their spirits strongly in the meetings have not remained in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Only those who have begun to walk according to the spirit have remained. We should not oppose any kind of release of the spirit, but neither do we need to emphasize these things. They help the saints, but in order to live the Body life, the saints must begin to walk according to the spirit. The release of the spirit in the meetings does not have the same spiritual value and weight as walking according to the spirit. If the goal of our work is merely to stir up the saints to release their spirits in the meetings, our work will be in vain. The condition of the meetings is like the weather, constantly changing. I have no trust in outward practices in the meetings. Whether a brother will be an elder should not be determined primarily by his exercise in the meetings. We do not trust in this. In some places we need revival, but we should not trust in that. Revival should usher the saints into walking according to the spirit. Romans 8 and 12 reveal that only such a walk will bring us into the practicality of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCHES&rsquo; NEED BEING<br />
THAT THE SAINTS WALK ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>What is needed in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is a daily living of walking according to the spirit. In the New Testament there is a certain order in the church with apostles, elders, and deacons. Nevertheless, this arrangement and these titles would not be necessary if all the saints walked according to the spirit. Such arrangements are necessary because life is lacking. In the New Jerusalem there will be no apostles, elders, or deacons but only precious stones (Rev. 21:19; cf. 1 Pet. 2:5). No position or title will enter with us into the New Jerusalem. The twelve apostles will be in the New Jerusalem, but they will be there as stones for the building (Rev. 21:14, 19). We need to have a foretaste of the New Jerusalem today. Because we are all members of the Body of Christ and have Christ as our Head, it is a shame if we need elders to regulate us. Every city has police, but it is a shame if the citizens need the police to control them directly. It is not an honor to have police come to our home. If all the citizens conducted themselves properly, the police would not be needed. If a local church is a miniature of the New Jerusalem with all the saints walking according to the spirit, the elders would not have much to do. Perhaps they would only need to announce the meeting times. Our need is not to be ruled outwardly but to be transformed to become precious stones for God&rsquo;s building. The elders need to minister life to the saints for their transformation.</p>
<p>It was a lack of life that caused titles, positions, and arrangements to come into the church. However, we know that these things are not God&rsquo;s intention, for the positions of apostles, elders, and deacons are gone in the book of Revelation. Even the writer of Revelation, the apostle John, did not identify himself as an apostle but only as a brother who was in spirit (1:9-10). When the seven Spirits are present, all the titles and positions are gone (v. 4). In Revelation we do not see apostles, elders, and deacons but the seven Spirits, enlightening the churches as the lampstands (3:1; 4:5; 1:20). Every local church should be a shining lampstand enlightened by the seven Spirits, not ruled by elders.</p>
<p>As leading ones, we should not trust in our outward doing or controlling. Instead, we need to pray much, take the lead to walk according to the spirit, and minister life to the saints. Our primary concern should not be to make arrangements. Several years ago I saw many files and paper forms in the deacons&rsquo; office of the church in Taipei, and all the serving ones were busy with routine work. I strongly advised the leading ones to forget about their arrangements and organizational, routine work and come back to spirit and life. When we are short of the Spirit, we tend to pick up routine works and become like a secular corporation. The leading ones should not trust in their work and arrangements but in the Spirit. Christianity today is mainly a matter of religious work, routine, and organization. However, the church is a living organism. Therefore, our service should not be routine but organic. Routine, organizational work in the churches is like the man-made bricks used to build the tower of Babel. As elders, we need to take the lead to forsake any such human work and instead help the saints to walk according to the spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is entirely a matter of spirit and life. The content and reality of the recovery is spirit and life. The boundary of the recovery is also spirit and life. Whether someone is in the recovery does not depend on outward appearances but on the inward reality of spirit and life. The enlightening and searching of the seven Spirits is the true test and measure of whether anything is of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Any rank or hierarchy in the local churches is absolutely abominable in the eyes of the Lord. An elder should not consider himself as an authority over others. Only spirit and life are acceptable to God.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we need to see what the Body of Christ is. If we see the Body, we will see what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is and what Christianity is. Religion is mainly a matter of hierarchy. The elders should not seek to have a position from which they can control the church. We need to humble ourselves and pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am nothing, I have nothing, and I can do nothing. Lord, everything must be done by You. Only You, as the Spirit, can minister life to people. I am only a slave to serve the saints.&rdquo; The root of the church&rsquo;s degradation and the source of religious, organized Christianity is man&rsquo;s attempt to rule over and control things. If we do not see this, such corruption and darkness may creep in and greatly damage the church in our locality. We will reap what we sow. I say this in love. We need to be exposed in order to receive the help through the light. Love always speaks the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTION AND ANSWER</h2>
<p><em>Question: Can you say something further about forsaking arrangements and organizational work and helping the saints to walk according to the spirit?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Some arrangements are necessary, but nothing should be our personal possession. Because the church is not a secular business, we should not spend most of our time on business affairs. As elders, most of our concern and labor should be to pray for the saints, visit them, shepherd them, and help them to grow.</p>
<p>Concerning the necessary arrangements, there should always be at least two capable, trustworthy brothers to take care of matters such as the church&rsquo;s bank account. Two gives us a testimony and is also practical for the continuation of the matter if one brother leaves. This kind of arrangement is necessary, but we should not put our trust in organization. Our trust is in the Spirit and life. We need to minister the Spirit and life to others so that they may grow.</p>
<p>Our tendency is to arrange things organizationally. Accordingly, the elders sometimes arrange groups to take care of different practical services. In making such arrangements, they consider which saints are best to serve in and lead the various groups. We should avoid this kind of organizational arrangement because it does not involve life. Some arrangements are necessary, but our main concern should be to contact the saints, fellowship with them, minister life to them, and stir up their interest and burden to serve. This way involves life. When the saints come to serve, certain things will be spontaneously manifested, such as who should take the lead in the groups. At that time, it will be necessary to make a few arrangements to appoint two or three to take the lead so that the service can go on in a good way.</p>
<p>The leading ones need to have much contact with the saints. The Lord may lead the elders to give a message in order to encourage the saints to serve. Such a message should minister a spirit of service and life for service. In addition, the leading ones also need to visit the saints individually as much as possible. Our way should be to minister life, not to organize. The way of life is to minister life to the saints by speaking and visiting. When the saints receive life, they will be stirred up and have a heart to participate in the church service. Nevertheless, the elders should oversee the service in order to balance, adjust, and arrange when necessary. They may see that it would be better for someone to serve in a different group. This oversight should still involve life. The elders should not give the saints the impression that their oversight is a matter of organization. Every service group should be open to anyone who feels to participate in that area of service. Legality and regulation kill the saints. We need to remember that the boundary line is not organization but the spirit and the life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING THE BODY LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12; 1 Cor. 12; 14</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we pray for the churches in Your recovery. We ask You to speak to us. Show us the proper way to go on. Lord, cover us from any frustrations, attacks, or disturbances from the evil one. We trust in Your cleansing, covering, and prevailing blood.</p>
<p>We need to see more concerning the Body life. There are four main chapters in the New Testament concerning the Body life&mdash;Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, Ephesians 4, and Colossians 2. These chapters were all written by Paul, the only New Testament writer to use the expression <em>the Body of Christ</em> to describe the church. In order to know what the Body life is, we must study these four chapters. Even the order of these chapters in the New Testament is meaningful. Romans 12, the first of the four chapters, lays the foundation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY LIFE REVEALED IN ROMANS 12</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Presenting Our Body a Living Sacrifice to God</h2>
<p>Romans 12 begins with an exhortation to present our physical body as a living sacrifice to God (v. 1). In order to do this, our body must be released from sin and death. In order to understand the matter of presenting our body as a living sacrifice to God in Romans 12, we must go back to chapters 6 through 8. In 6:6 we see that our body is &ldquo;the body of sin.&rdquo; Then in 7:24 we are told that our body is &ldquo;the body of this death.&rdquo; According to Genesis 1:27, God made man in His image so that man could fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. However, the fall brought in sin and death, which damaged man and annulled his body for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s purpose. The body of sin is strong in sinning against God, but the body of this death is weak in acting to serve and please God. Romans 8:11 tells us that our body is a mortal body, in other words, a dying body. In a sense, we begin dying the day that we are born. Apart from God&rsquo;s salvation, we are only dying. However, when we are saved, God enters our being. He first enters our inmost part, our spirit. Accordingly, Romans 8:10 shows that life is imparted into our spirit. Then as we walk according to the spirit (v. 4), life spreads from our spirit to our mind, which represents our soul (v. 6). If we allow the Spirit of the Triune God to indwell us, to occupy us, life will eventually spread to our mortal body. In this way our body of sin and of death is recovered to become living and active for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s purpose. It is such a body that we can present as a living sacrifice to God for the Body life.</p>
<p>It is natural and religious to try to present our body to serve the Lord without the revelation of Romans 6&mdash;8. These chapters reveal that our body is the body of sin and of death and that our mortal body needs to be enlivened in order to be prepared, proper, qualified, and capable for God&rsquo;s use. It is only such a body that we can present to God for the Body life. We cannot present the body of sin and of death to God. However, Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; The context of this verse indicates that to be freed from the law of sin and of death means to have our body freed from sin and death. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&rdquo; This is to set the body of sin and of death free from sin and death. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &ldquo;The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete.&rdquo; First our spirit and our soul are freed from sin and death. Ultimately, our body is also freed so that our entire tripartite being is freed from the dominion of sin and death. Then our body is qualified to be presented to God, for God can use only such a freed body. Thus, we need to walk according to the spirit so that our body will be freed from sin and death, given life, and qualified to be presented to God.</p>
<p>When our body is ready to be presented to God, our entire being is ready. We are composed of three parts, but these parts are not separate. It is impossible to have a spirit and soul that are holy and a body that is not holy. If we walk according to the spirit, our spirit, soul, and body will be free from sin and death and full of life, and our body will be qualified to be presented to God. This is a basic requirement for the Body life, for if our body is not presented to God, we cannot have the Body life. In order to have the Body life, the primary requirement is to present to God a freed and enlivened body, which is able to serve God to fulfill His purpose.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Transformed by the Renewing of the Mind</h2>
<p>After Romans 12:1 exhorts us to present our freed and enlivened bodies to God for the Body life, verse 2 deals with our soul, represented by the mind. It says, &ldquo;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.&rdquo; The order of the spirit, mind, and body in Romans 8 is reversed in Romans 12. Romans 8 reveals that we are freed and enlivened first in the spirit, then in the mind, and lastly in the body (vv. 2-11), and Romans 12 shows that in order to be used by God for the Body of Christ, we must first present our body, then have our mind renewed, and lastly be burning in the spirit (vv. 1-2, 11). This is a two-way traffic, coming and going. We are freed from sin and death first in our spirit, then in our mind, and lastly in our body. Then we are used by God first in our body, then in our mind, and lastly in our spirit.</p>
<p>The body needs to be enlivened and presented to God. The mind needs to be set on the spirit by being filled and occupied with the things concerning Christ and renewed with the divine element and essence (8:6; 12:2). To have our mind renewed is not to change our mind but to have a new element and essence added into our mind so that it becomes a new mind. When the mind is renewed with the divine element and essence, we know God&rsquo;s will, that which is well pleasing to Him. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.&rdquo; Thus, the body is enlivened and presented, the mind is renewed, and the spirit is burning. These are the three basic requirements for the Body life. When our being is in such a condition, we can and will function for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Having an enlivened body, a renewed mind, and a burning spirit depends on our walking according to the spirit. Therefore, walking according to the spirit is a basic requirement. It is also the conclusion of the first seven chapters of Romans. Chapters 1 and 2 tell us that we were fallen sinners; chapters 3 and 4 show that we were redeemed, justified, and reconciled; and chapters 5 through 7 deal with our sanctification. Then Romans 8:4 reveals that we need to walk according to the spirit. This is the conclusion of Romans 1&mdash;7. We need to see this and live a life of walking according to the spirit. The issue will be that our body is enlivened, our mind is renewed, and our spirit is burning.</p>
<p>When we walk according to the spirit and have an enlivened body, a renewed mind, and a burning spirit, we will be prepared for the Body life and function properly in the Body life. Our functioning will not be individualistic, as the work of many Christian workers is. The work of such ones is not to function in the Body. If we pass through the experiences revealed in Romans 1&mdash;8, we will function as members in the Body according to Romans 12. There is a great difference between working individualistically and functioning in the Body. If we migrate to establish a church in a new locality, we should not go individualistically but as a member functioning in the Body. In order to do this, we need to pass through the experiences revealed in Romans 1&mdash;8. Otherwise, it is only our flesh migrating.</p>
<p>My heart aches for and pities those in Christianity who are in darkness. They may have objective, traditional, doctrinal theology, but they do not have the living light. Therefore, they work in blindness. The Lord said that such ones are &ldquo;blind guides of the blind&rdquo; (Matt. 15:14). However, the light in the word of the New Testament, and especially in the Epistles of Paul, is clear to us. How we need to thank the Lord that He has opened His word to us, making every portion of the Bible transparent and bright.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY LIFE REVEALED IN 1 CORINTHIANS 12</h2>
<p>After we enter into the experience of functioning in the Body according to Romans 12, we can go on to the experience of 1 Corinthians 12. First Corinthians 12 is a higher stage than Romans 12. Romans 8 concerns walking according to the spirit (v. 4), and 1 Corinthians 12 concerns drinking of the Spirit (v. 13). Drinking of the Spirit is not merely for our individual enjoyment of the Lord but for the Body life. In the past those who were stirred up to drink of the Spirit but did not care for the Body life eventually lost their enjoyment. If our drinking of the Spirit is for the Body life, we will maintain our enjoyment. We should care more for the Body life than for excitement. The drinking of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians is for the Body life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Drinking of the Spirit Issuing In Functioning<br />
in the Body and for the Body</h2>
<p>Drinking of the Spirit issues in at least three things that are recorded and developed in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14. Chapter 13 is a parenthetical section. First, drinking of the Spirit issues in functioning. No other chapters in the New Testament go to such lengths to show us the way to function as do 1 Corinthians 12 and 14. If we see the real functioning in these two chapters, we will realize that much of the preaching and teaching among Christians today is abnormal because these activities are neither in the Body nor for the Body. Paul teaches that the proper speaking in the meetings, whether prophesying or speaking in tongues, is in the Body and for the Body. When we drink the Spirit, we will function properly.</p><h2 class="head2">Drinking of the Spirit Issuing In<br />
Embracing Every Member</h2>
<p>Second, drinking of the Spirit issues in embracing every member. If we drink of the Spirit, we will embrace every member, especially the weaker and despised ones. First Corinthians 12:18 says, &ldquo;God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed.&rdquo; Verse 24 says, &ldquo;God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.&rdquo; We need to consider the way that God has blended the Body of Christ together. Parents desire that all their children will be healthy and intelligent so that they can have a successful education and career. However, some children are born with or develop physical and mental disabilities. God uses such children to test us. No one desires to have this kind of child, but we must love and honor such children. Similarly, in every local church there are some weaker believers. Such ones may be of any age. It seems that some only make trouble. They may be opinionated, critical, and even rebellious. No elders desire to have such ones in their church. However, just as a family cannot cut off a weaker or troublesome child, we cannot exclude such believers. If we exclude any believer, we are no longer a genuine local church.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12 strongly conveys the concept that we must embrace and love every believer. Verses 21 through 23 say, &ldquo;The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. But much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. And those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness.&rdquo; We should not despise any member whom we think is intolerably talkative, opinionated, or rebellious. If we cut off such ones, we become sectarian. We need to remember that it was God who created and saved every believer. In the past I wondered why the Lord chose to save weaker and troublesome ones and bring them into the church life in His recovery. Now I am not bothered when I see such ones; instead, I rejoice and thank the Lord, for such ones cause us to know how narrow, religious, and proud we are. Troublesome ones terminate our self-confidence because they create situations in which we do not know what to do. The need to embrace such ones may cause us to think that we are not the right person to be an elder. The church is like a family, and no member can be cut off. If we are walking according to the spirit and drinking of the Spirit, we will embrace, love, and serve the weaker and troublesome ones.</p>
<p>Because every believer is born of God, they are all our brothers or sisters. Therefore, we must embrace all believers. We must be careful not to become sectarian. Paul says in Romans 16:17, &ldquo;Mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.&rdquo; In Titus 3:10 he says, &ldquo;A factious man, after a first and second admonition, refuse.&rdquo; However, Paul also says in 1 Corinthians 12:24-25, &ldquo;God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked, that there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care for one another.&rdquo; The drinking of the one Spirit issues not only in functioning in and for the Body life but also in covering all kinds of weak believers for the Body life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Drinking of the Spirit Issuing In<br />
Not Overstepping Others&rsquo; Ministry</h2>
<p>Third, drinking of the Spirit issues in not overstepping others&rsquo; ministry, which is not to contradict others&rsquo; functioning when we function. As we function, we should always be on the alert to keep the harmony. This basic thought is in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14. For instance, 1 Corinthians 14:30-32 says, &ldquo;If something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent. For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged. And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.&rdquo; This indicates that while one is speaking, another may receive inspiration to speak. If this happens while we are speaking, we should immediately stop and allow the other one to speak. In order not to overstep another&rsquo;s ministry, we should not interrupt someone who is speaking in a meeting, but if another receives a burden to speak while we are speaking, we should yield to that one. In this way there will be no contradiction or conflict among the functioning members but only harmony.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12 and 14 reveal that when we drink of the Spirit, we will function, embrace every member, especially the weaker ones, and not overstep others. Chapter 13 concerns love, which is also an issue of the drinking of the Spirit. When we drink of the Spirit, we can only love, and we love everyone. Love edifies more than any gift. Prophesying builds up the church more than tongue-speaking, yet without love neither gift means anything (14:1-5; 13:1-2). Even if we do not have the gift of prophecy, we can love. Love is not a gift but an innate capacity that every believer has. Furthermore, the divine life is love. Since we have been born of God, we possess the divine life, and the divine life loves. God is the source of life. To drink of the Spirit is to drink of the divine life. As we drink of life, life saturates us. Because this life is love, it causes us to love, which allows us to live the Body life. If we do not embrace all the believers, we are not in the Body life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTION AND ANSWER</h2>
<p><em>Question: Weaker members sometimes say something in a meeting that is not according to the truth or conveys something negative or damaging. As leading ones, how should we respond to such situations in order to care for the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: To take care of this kind of situation, we first need the basic understanding and attitude that the Body is welcoming and inclusive. Second, if a brother is speaking something that is not profitable to the church or may damage some of the saints, the leading ones need to exercise wisdom in deciding how to handle the situation. The wisest way may be for the leading ones to look for an opportunity to say, &ldquo;Brother, that is good enough.&rdquo; I have seen this done many times, and in most cases the speaking one stopped speaking. If the speaking one does not heed such a word, the elders must allow him to speak a few more sentences before asking him to stop again. However, we need to avoid direct contradiction or argument. If a leading brother stands up to interrupt the speaking one and immediately tries to correct what he has spoken, this will only do further damage. We should not address what has been spoken until a later time. Furthermore, the leading one who asks the speaking brother to stop should not be the one to speak next. He should allow the meeting to continue under the leading of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The effect of negative speaking on a local church depends on the spiritual education of the saints. If their spiritual education is adequate, another member will immediately stand up to speak something positive. However, it should not relate directly to the negative speaking. When someone&rsquo;s negative speaking touches a certain subject, the whole congregation should ignore the subject in that meeting. It is wise to wait for another time. Perhaps six months later, the proper time will come for a leading one to speak something that will heal the wound or recover the loss.</p>
<p>The church is not a battleground. We should not have a combative atmosphere in any church meeting. Even if someone comes with the intention to argue, we should not respond or react. In this way the church will remain orderly. First Corinthians 14:33 says, &ldquo;God is not a God of confusion but of peace.&rdquo; Verse 40 says, &ldquo;All things must be done becomingly and in order.&rdquo; Some incorrectly interpret these verses to mean that those who attend a meeting should stay seated and quiet and that the meeting should follow a set program. However, according to the context, the main thought of the apostle Paul in writing this is that we should not contradict others or argue when we speak in the meetings.</p>
<p>As leading ones of the church, we have to take care of the meetings. Just as in a family, we should not cast out the weaker and troublesome ones, but we sometimes have to act to protect them and the rest of the family. If a young boy is playing with a knife, his older brother should do something to wisely remove the knife so that the young one does not injure himself or others. This should be done not to exclude the child but to protect him and the rest of the family. We need wisdom for this. Our basic concept and attitude should be to embrace everyone. While keeping this basic attitude, we need to exercise our spirit to receive wisdom from the Lord concerning how to handle each case.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING THE BODY LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4; Col. 2</h1>
<p>In the Body life, because we walk according to the spirit and drink of the Spirit, the natural life is terminated, the natural strength is not used, and the natural way is altogether put aside (Rom. 8:4; 1 Cor. 12:13). Until we reach the stage of the Body life, we still live in the natural life and use our natural strength, way, and wisdom quite often. Within the realm of our natural wisdom, we have many schemes. It is even possible to have schemes and bad intentions in the church life. For instance, some brothers may intend that others would stop serving. This is a bad intention and a scheme. We thank the Lord that the church is different from society, but we have to admit that sometimes we are not pure in our motive, intention, and action. When we live in the natural life and do things with the natural strength, by the natural way, and with the natural wisdom, we cannot be pure. Even if we think that we have a pure motive and do not want to damage others, we are still not pure if we take the natural way. We need to realize that anything natural comes from an unclean, evil source. However, it is difficult for us not to be natural until we reach the stage of the Body life by walking according to the spirit and drinking of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Walking according to the spirit is a great matter. It is the conclusion of the first seven chapters of Romans. However, if we consider our experience, we have to admit that most of our walk is not according to the spirit but according to the flesh. We need to see that our living is still mostly natural. This is very serious because if we would walk according to the spirit, all the problems spontaneously would be solved, for the natural life, strength, way, and wisdom would be terminated. We should not think that we do not scheme. Only a person who continually walks according to the spirit does not scheme. Such a one has no intention to gain anything, be somebody, or have any success. Instead, he only lives the Lord. If we do not continually walk according to the spirit, we all have schemes. <em>Scheme</em> is a negative word, and we have to realize that all our natural intentions are schemes. As long as our intention is natural, even if it is a seemingly good intention to help the church or the saints or to do something for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we plan to have a success. Such natural planning is scheming for success and is impure. Perhaps we do not do outwardly sinful things, but if we scheme to be successful, even if we say that it is for the Lord, it is actually for our self and is natural. When we reach the stage of the Body life, we will be pure. We will not have any intention, and we will know only to live Christ and minister Christ as life to others. We may think that such a living is not easy to attain, but when we reach the stage of the Body life, it will be spontaneous and easy.</p>
<p>Around 1946, Brother Watchman Nee and I were fellowshipping one day in Shanghai. I had recently visited the churches in a certain region. Brother Nee asked me, &ldquo;Why did you visit the churches there?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I had a burden to help the saints.&rdquo; I thought that this was pure and right, but Brother Nee replied that my going was a matter of politics. I was shocked and thought, &ldquo;Then we cannot work. Whatever we do in the work is politics.&rdquo; I asked Brother Nee to explain, but he only repeated, &ldquo;That was politics.&rdquo; I could not understand and was greatly troubled. However, after some days passed, I received light. When Brother Nee asked me why I went to visit the churches, the proper answer was, &ldquo;The Lord led me to go.&rdquo; The source of our activity in the work should be the Lord&rsquo;s leading and not our intention. Acts 8:26-27 says, &ldquo;An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is the desert route. And he rose up and went.&rdquo; Verses 29 through 30 say, &ldquo;The Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot. And when Philip ran up, he heard him reading Isaiah the prophet.&rdquo; Philip had no intention but only the Lord&rsquo;s leading. We may say that we have a burden when we actually have an intention to have some success or accomplish something. Thus, I eventually was convinced that my going to visit the churches had been a matter of politics. Because some there did not see the light concerning the church adequately, I had a burden to go in order to correct the wrong ones, to help the disappointed ones, and to strengthen the leading ones. Although this seemed to be good, it was not the Spirit&rsquo;s leading but my doing.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between our intentions and the Spirit&rsquo;s leading. When we reach the stage of the Body life, we will not care for our own intentions but only for the Spirit&rsquo;s leading. If the Spirit leads us to go somewhere, we will go regardless of whether we think that anything will come of our going. Likewise, if the Lord does not lead us to go, we will not go. If we visit a locality because we have a burden to go, but we do not have the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we may have outward success. However, that church may begin to follow us personally. This is subtle politics. Without the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, we must question the real motive of our so-called burdens in the work. Most Christian works today come from political intentions and schemes. As a result, these works are not in the Body but in division. Everyone has their own individual work, and every work is a division. When we are in the Body, all our individual intentions, burdens, and desires are swallowed up. We only live and function in order to minister Christ as life to the saints. We have no intention to accomplish anything outward. This is the difference. With our individual intentions, the natural life, strength, way, and schemes are always involved. Furthermore, there are always divisions, with each one having a separate work. There is no Body life among most Christians today because most live the natural man with the natural life, strength, way, wisdom, intentions, desires, and burdens.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY LIFE REVEALED<br />
IN EPHESIANS 4 AND COLOSSIANS 2</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:15-16 says, &ldquo;Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; Thus, as we walk according to the spirit and drink of the Spirit, we grow up into Christ the Head. Then out from the Head every member of the Body ministers something to the Body, which builds up the Body. A supply comes out from the Head to the Body through the members for the building up of the Body.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:19 indicates that the Body holds the Head, which means that the Body exalts the Head. The ultimate issue of the Body life is the Body exalting the Head as everything. Colossians reveals Christ as the all-inclusive One. Thus, the all-inclusive Christ, who is the Head, is exalted by His Body. Because Christ is everything, in the Body life there is nothing natural&mdash;no natural life, strength, gimmicks, ways, skills, schemes, intentions, or desires.</p>
<p>The Body life is a high goal that requires many experiences to attain. However, we should not think that when we reach such a high stage of the Body life, there will be no weak or troublesome ones in the churches. There will always be such ones to test whether we are inclusive. In a proper family there are mature ones to maintain a proper family life, but there are also weak and troublesome ones. Whether a family is proper or not depends on whether there are mature ones to maintain a proper family life. In a large family only a few may be the mature ones who maintain good order in the family; the rest may be weak, sick, dissenting, and rebellious. The church should be such a normal, proper family.</p>
<p>An army has age limits and physical requirements and does not accept those who are not qualified. However, the church is not an army but a family, which has no such requirements. The members of a family may be of many different ages, sizes, and conditions. We should not expect that every member of a local church will be at the same stage in spiritual growth. Neither should we expect that there will not be weak and troublesome ones. Such a church does not exist. In the New Jerusalem we will all be fully transformed, but we cannot expect that today. In 1 Thessalonians 3:12 Paul writes, &ldquo;The Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all.&rdquo; We should love everyone.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: To what extent has the Body life existed on the earth?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Strictly speaking, the proper Body life has never existed, but I believe that it will exist. I do not think it existed at Paul&rsquo;s time. I even doubt that the original recipients of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles understood as much as we do today. The seven epistles in Revelation depict a messy situation in many of the churches. However, they were still genuine churches, and there were overcomers in each church. This indicates that in a certain church some saints may be in the reality of the Body life, but others in the same church may not. Again, this is like a family in which only a few members are mature and keep the family normal.</p>
<p><em>Question: Is there an outward difference in the experience and expression of believers who walk according to the spirit, drink of the Spirit, and live the Body life and of those who do not?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is a visible difference. Every kind of life has an expression. If a brother walks according to the spirit, there will be a corresponding expression, or manifestation, in his living that others can see. A brother who may genuinely love the Lord but walks according to the flesh will be opinionated and quarrelsome. Such a one is fleshly and natural, and the more he tries to do for the Lord, the more he damages the church. However, if we cast out such ones, we are no longer the church but only a sect. This is the practice in today&rsquo;s Christianity. Thus, we have a great responsibility to tolerate and embrace every believer, and we also have to walk according to the spirit, drink the Spirit, and live the Body life. Otherwise, the Lord will have no way. All these points are in Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. This was his spirit; he was such a person. To be in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a matter of degree. However, we may be in the recovery only to a certain extent. This is a serious matter, and we need to be open to the Lord to see where we are.</p>
<p>From the late 1820s the Brethren had a good start for about twenty-five years. Then they gradually veered off, and today they are no longer part of the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date recovery. Because their habit and tradition were to have strict requirements, they were divided again and again. Now there are thousands of divisions among the Brethren. They emphasize biblical knowledge and doctrinal accuracy, but they have failed. It is possible for the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today to similarly err. The way to be saved from such failure is to walk according to the spirit, drink of the Spirit, and embrace all believers. We need to be inclusive, not exclusive, and an inclusive church is a messy church. Most Christians today are accustomed to frequently leaving the group they meet with when they no longer like the meetings. For believers or local churches to be exclusive is the same in principle. We should not try to exclude all the things that we do not like or agree with. The Lord allows many things that He does not like or agree with. The church is inclusive. If we are not inclusive, we are sectarian. Paul was inclusive. In 1 and 2 Corinthians he was severe and strict in dealing with some of the Corinthians, but he forgave everyone. However, some of the Corinthian believers who were so &ldquo;holy&rdquo; would not forgive. Therefore, Paul had to charge them to forgive (2 Cor. 6:11, 13; 2:7, 10).</p>
<p><em>Question: I see now that I should not do anything for the Lord according to my intentions, but I fear that if I wait to be led by the Spirit, nothing will happen. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The definition, or analysis, of spiritual things may differ from the practice of such things, just as what is taught in a classroom may differ from what works in a laboratory. When we practice to walk according to the spirit, there will be a spontaneous issue, just as a tree that is living will spontaneously produce leaves, blossoms, and fruit. Daniel 11:32 says, &ldquo;The people who know their God will show strength and take action.&rdquo; Knowing God issues in our taking action. If we do not take action, this indicates that we do not have a living knowledge of God. If we walk according to the spirit, it will not be in vain. As we walk according to the spirit, we should show strength and take action but without politics or the intention to gain a personal kingdom. This is not easy.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LORD BEING THE UNIQUE CENTER<br />
IN THE CHURCH AND THE WORK</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS AND SERVING ONES<br />
NEEDING TO AVOID BEING A CENTER</h2>
<p>The elders and those who serve in the work of the ministry need to beware of the danger of becoming a center in their locality or in the work. A center is like the hub in a wheel. When the hub is removed, the rest of the wheel collapses. The church in our locality or the area in which we work should not collapse or stop if we are gone. We need to realize that to be a center of the church or the work is to be a cancer to the Body of Christ, which will eventually bring death to the Body. Throughout the years I have seen much damage come in as a result of this matter.</p>
<p>It is easy for those who receive help from us to make us a center. It is also easy to make ourselves a center. We must realize that within our fallen human nature is a tendency to like to be the center. We may say that we do not have an intention or desire to be a center, but our way of caring for the church or doing the work often builds us up as a center. Becoming a center is a danger especially for those who are useful in the hands of the Lord, because others tend to consider such ones as a center. If we are not used much by the Lord, no one will consider us as a center. However, when we are useful, we become a magnet, drawing others to ourselves. If we are able to minister life to others and help them with their problems, we become very attractive to others; it seems that we become the life pulse of the church in our locality. To attract others involves the flesh, regardless of the apparent purity of our intention or desire.</p>
<p>The disciples of John the Baptist became jealous when they saw that many went to Jesus to be baptized (John 3:23-26). John said to them, &ldquo;You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him. He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full. He must increase, but I must decrease&rdquo; (vv. 28-30). This case shows that those who are useful in the work for the Lord can easily become an attracting center. John&rsquo;s disciples made him a center, but he tried to turn them to the Lord. However, because others made him a center, the Lord had to allow John to be put into prison. Ultimately, John was martyred, which terminated that center.</p>
<p>The Corinthians said, &ldquo;I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:12). This indicates that they considered either Cephas or Apollos or Paul as a center. According to the record of the New Testament, Paul rendered much help to them, but he avoided being the center. Apollos was not as useful as Paul, but Paul places himself on the same level as Apollos and makes God the center when he writes, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth&rdquo; (3:6). In 4:6 Paul again ranked himself with Apollos in order to avoid being the center. This case also exposes the tendency for a useful one to become a center.</p>
<p>The Lord is the unique center in the work and the church. We should not make ourselves a center. The work and the church should not be arranged around us. The more useful and capable we are, the more difficult it is to avoid being a center. As we handle matters in a good way with a good result, our reputation will be built up, and many people and affairs will come to us. In order to avoid becoming a center, we should often allow people and business affairs to go to other brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WORD OF CAUTION</h2>
<p>Many churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery began by meeting in a home. For instance, the church in Los Angeles began in Brother Samuel Chang&rsquo;s home. It is scriptural for the church to meet in a home, but there are certain related dangers that we must avoid. We sometimes try to avoid having the church meetings in our home because it is troublesome. However, we often like to have the church meetings in our home because it is the most effective way to fulfill our hidden desire to become a center in the church. When the church meets in our home, we soon learn everything about the saints and become a hub of information.</p>
<p>If the church meets in the home of a single brother, there is a great danger of sin because of the temptation of the flesh. In matters concerning the flesh, we should never trust ourselves or even think that the Lord&rsquo;s grace is sufficient to prevent us from falling into sin. We must avoid the temptation altogether. If the church meets in a married brother&rsquo;s home, his wife is a great protection from fornication. However, another danger arises because wives often maneuver to control matters. It is difficult for husbands to avoid being maneuvered by their wives. Wives also like to be the center. The wives of brothers who are useful to the Lord in the work or the church often try to exert some control in certain matters. As a result, the wife of a brother who serves in the ministry or the church may become the source of corruption. We who serve the Lord in the ministry or the church must be on the alert, first, not to allow ourselves to be the center, and second, not to allow our wives to maneuver matters related to our service. We do not need to fight against our wives, but we must realize that the wives should not be involved with our service.</p>
<p>In American culture the wife always accompanies the husband. Peter and other apostles were married, but the New Testament does not record the names of their wives (Matt. 8:14; 1 Cor. 9:5). What the Bible does not say is often as meaningful as what it says. The lengthy record of the Bible does not mention the name of even one of the apostles&rsquo; wives. The physical descendants of the apostles are not mentioned either. We do not know who the children of Peter were. The New Testament tells us only of spiritual sons. Mark was a spiritual son to Peter (1 Pet. 5:13). Paul never married, but he had two spiritual sons&mdash;Timothy and Titus (1 Tim. 1:2; Titus 1:4). If the physical children of apostles were their successors, there would be no need for God&rsquo;s selection and predestination. We do not decide who will follow us in the work.</p>
<p>The New Testament records the names of one couple who had the church meetings in their home. First Corinthians 16:19 says, &ldquo;Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord, with the church, which is in their house.&rdquo; When Aquila and Prisca lived in Ephesus, the church there met in their home. When they lived in Rome, the church there also met in their home (Rom. 16:3, 5). However, the New Testament does not indicate that Prisca did anything to maneuver the affairs of the church.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to allow our wife to be involved with the affairs of the church. We should not need to fight against our wife, but we need to keep our standing as the head. If our wife proposes much to us concerning the affairs of the church, we should allow her to speak in order to care for her. However, we must discern whether what she says is from the Lord in her spirit or from her self. If we do not exercise discernment and maintain our standing, we will suffer, and the work and the church will suffer. According to God&rsquo;s economy, the Bible does not allow females to be the head, but wives sometimes try to be the head through their husbands. We must avoid this, or the church and the work will suffer. We must love our wives and respect them to the uttermost, but in the church and the work we must be careful not to be maneuvered by them.</p>
<p>When the church meets in a home, it is difficult for the wife of the host not to maneuver things. It is not easy for such a wife to go on properly, because the danger and the temptation for her to maneuver things are always present. Few wives have the intention to maneuver, but regardless of their intention, they may damage the church through their maneuvering. Serving brothers&rsquo; becoming a center and their wives&rsquo; maneuvering are two very damaging things in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is difficult to overcome these two sources of damage, and we need to be careful to avoid them. If we trust in ourselves, we are placing ourselves in great danger of falling into one of these problems.</p><h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: You have encouraged us to walk according to the spirit and not to rely on the exercise of the spirit in the meetings. If we leading brothers are led by the Lord to change the meeting environment, how should we help the saints who want to continue in the old way?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The basic principle is that we should not make anything a legality. If we decide to give up the old way and force our decision on the church, this is legality. When we first began to the call on the name of the Lord and pray-read in the meetings in the 1960s, I often felt that the calling and the pray-reading were somewhat wild, but I did not say much to correct the situation. Recently, I did not feel good about the shouting of some young brothers in the meetings because I did not believe that their shouting was of the spirit, but I did not say anything. In principle, we must help the saints to know the real exercise of the spirit, which is not merely shouting or excitement. Recently, some young brothers laughed wildly in a meeting. I do not believe that it was the release of the spirit, and I do not believe that it edified others. The elders should adjust such ones in fellowship not during the meeting but afterward. Otherwise, the elders are being negligent. We would not be wild or loose if the president were among us. Therefore, we certainly should not be this way in the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>The elders should care for the saints as children in their family. When some of the children do not behave, the elders need to do something. The elders should not expect that a traveling co-worker would do something to correct a situation. The church is under the care of the eldership. The elders have many responsibilities, just as parents must do many things to raise their children. Regrettably, I have noticed that some elders do not do their duty. In every meeting the elders should be watchful. The elders are overseers of the church (Acts 20:28, 17). As overseers, they should exercise oversight.</p>
<p>The elders should not try to force the saints in their localities to stop the so-called old way. That is legality. Instead, the elders need to pray much and do their best to help the saints learn the real exercise and release of spirit. A saint may call on the Lord loudly in order to be released from some bondage. That is genuine and is not a performance. We all need to exercise and release the spirit, call on the name of the Lord, and pray-read in the meetings. However, we should not be unruly. We should not be a &ldquo;pray-reading church,&rdquo; neither should we be a &ldquo;non-pray-reading church.&rdquo; Both are wrong and are matters of religion. We should not make anything a legality. We like to have things clear-cut and make regulations. However, according to the New Testament, the church is absolutely a matter of the spirit and life. It should have no legal regulations or bondage. A local church is simply the saints in a locality meeting together. It does not need to have official membership or a record of its members. Whoever believes in the Lord Jesus is a member of the local church wherever they are.</p>
<p><em>Question: First Peter 5:3 says that the elders should be patterns of the flock. Can you share more about what the elders should do to become such patterns?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The elders in each locality should fellowship concerning what needs to be done. There is much for the elders to do. Those who only come to the meetings and do routine work need to begin to do something more. Every elder can begin by praying to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The Lord may lead the elders to contact every saint in their locality. They may contact the saints in different ways&mdash;one at a time or in small groups, by visiting them or inviting them somewhere. If the elders begin to contact all the saints, they will stir up the practical shepherding in the church. First, the elders will shepherd the saints; then the saints will begin to shepherd others. This is the way for the elders to be a pattern to the flock. They are the first sheep to do something, and the rest of the flock will follow them to do what they are doing.</p>
<p>We are always short of shepherding. There is also a great need for gospel preaching. This is not simply a matter of announcing a love feast and a gospel meeting. We know from experience that this alone does not work. Once we have laid a foundation, then we can use this way. A love feast for the gospel is the drawing in of a fishing net. First, we must cast the net. If only a few new ones come to a love feast for the gospel, it is difficult to give a gospel message with impact.</p>
<p>There are many things for the elders to do&mdash;it all depends upon their seeking the Lord&rsquo;s leading and carrying it out properly. However, as the elders work, they should pass things on to others. The more we do, the less there should be in our hand. After we finish doing something, there should be nothing left in our hand. Every burden should go to others. We need to include others in everything we do in order to pass the burden on to them. From the very beginning, whatever we do should lay the foundation to pass the burden on to others. After a year of laboring on something, no burden should remain with us. Every bit of the burden should be on others&rsquo; shoulders. If we practice in this way, a revival will come in which every member will be functioning and active in the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRINCIPLES FOR<br />
SERVING THE LORD FULL TIME</h1>
<p>There is a need for some to serve the Lord full time in every place, even in a small village in the countryside. There is always a need, but we must have some spiritual ability in order to discover or expose the need. Some businessmen are able to make money anywhere; even in the poorest country they can discover a market in which to do business and make money. In a sense, their ability creates the market. Similarly, if we have the spiritual &ldquo;money-making&rdquo; ability, we can create a spiritual &ldquo;market&rdquo; anywhere. If we have the ability to create a spiritual market, the work may demand that we give up our job in order to serve full time. If it seems that we need to serve only part time, the reason may be that we lack the ability. There is a great need for full-timers everywhere. The need for full-time service depends on our ability to create the market. There are as many markets as there are full-timers who have the spiritual money-making ability.</p>
<p>We may have the spiritual ability to create a need for a full-time serving one, but we should not think that we are the right person to meet the need. I have always thought that I am the wrong person to serve full time because there are many problems that I cannot solve and many saints whom I cannot help. No one is the right person to serve full time. Only the Lord is the right person. We have nothing to boast about. We are inadequate and insufficient in many things. According to Mark 11:23, faith can remove a mountain, but when there is a mountain that needs to be removed, we do not have the faith. When we face great problems, we can only sigh and groan. We can only do a little. We need much help from the other members of the Body in all the local churches.</p>
<p>Wherever we are, we should exercise our spiritual ability to create a need for full-time service. We should not say that we do not have this ability. We must try our best to become one who has such ability. Perhaps we do not have great spiritual ability, but we have a little. We need to exercise our ability to create opportunities to serve. We may begin by shepherding the saints. If we do not know how to shepherd, we can simply invite some to our home and fellowship with them in mutuality, asking them to help us. If we do this a few nights each week, after six months there may be a need for us to serve full time. However, we should not be proud or think that we are the right person. If we think that we are qualified or special, we should not serve full time. Every full-timer is nobody. The same principle applies to preaching the gospel. We should not think that it is too difficult to bring people to the Lord in a particular place. It only depends on whether we go to do it. After preaching the gospel, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am a useless servant. You have chosen the wrong person. I am not the right one. I do not know how to preach the gospel. I even do not adequately know what the gospel is.&rdquo; Although we should pray in this way, many sinners will be saved through us if we create the market.</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: There is a new locality in which the Lord has gained a few older sisters and some young ones. They have begun meeting in the homes of the sisters. Is this a good situation?</em></p>
<p>Answer: No situation is ideal. I have seen some good beginnings that eventually came to nothing. In the early 1930s Brother Watchman Nee was invited to the capital of my home province to preach the gospel. There was a large medical school there that missionaries had established. When Brother Nee preached the gospel, more than fifty medical students were brought to the Lord. Many of them began meeting as a local church. At first, because they did not have any other place to meet, they met in a cemetery. We admired this wonderful start and treasured these medical students. After graduating to become medical doctors, almost all of them were distracted and left the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This marvelous beginning came to almost nothing. However, other beginnings that seemed very poor have become wonderful churches today.</p>
<p>We should not trust in any situation. No one can tell whether any kind of beginning will eventually be prevailing. Seemingly promising young believers in the church may leave after a few years. Others who seem to be hopeless cases may become excellent believers. We cannot predict or figure out how new ones will turn out. As parents, we must do our best to take care of our children. We must nourish and educate them with the Word and the knowledge and grace of the Lord. However, we should not think that we can cause our children to be saved. If we could, there would be no need for the Father to choose and to predestinate in eternity past. Nevertheless, we cannot neglect our responsibility to care for our children. Neither can we neglect to care for the believers and the churches. Only the Lord knows whether a new believer will become one who pursues Him and is useful to Him or whether a new group will become a strong local church. We do not know. Therefore, we must have a broadened heart to embrace all believers and the new local churches. We should not despise the apparently weak ones. The Lord often uses such ones.</p>
<p>Every beginning is a good beginning, and every place is a good place. The usefulness and longevity of a beginning often depend on our spiritual money-making ability. If we have the spiritual ability, we can create a very profitable market in a seemingly small or weak situation. We should never question how long a group will last. We cannot know. Only the Lord knows. We need to learn not to be prejudiced. We live in the age of grace. We cannot control grace; it is like the sun and the rain. Matthew 5:45 says, &ldquo;Your Father who is in the heavens...causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust.&rdquo; We can only say, &ldquo;It is all the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.&rdquo; The leading ones in every local church need to learn the lesson not to overly appreciate nor despise anyone. We do not know the future. We should not play politics, but we should avoid offending people, because everyone is promising for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Much can change in a few years. We must embrace everyone&mdash;good or bad, promising or not.</p>
<p><em>Question: Would you share more about the proper exercise of authority?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should not be concerned about our authority. The real authority among God&rsquo;s people is love. Ephesians 5:24 says, &ldquo;Let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything.&rdquo; Since there is submission on the female side, it seems that there should be the exercise of authority on the male side. However, verse 25 does not exhort the husbands to exercise their authority. Instead, it says, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives.&rdquo; In order to exercise genuine authority, we have to love others. Whether we have authority is tested by whether we have love. Those who have the most love have the highest authority. If a brother conducts himself or functions in a meeting in a wrong way, the elders should go to him not to exercise their authority but to love him. They should not only correct him but also minister something positive to him.</p>
<p>If we exercise our authority but do not love people, we will cut off one member after another until there is no one left. That is not the way. The proper way is to always forgive, love, and embrace. To love and embrace others unjustly is better than to hate justly. To cut others off in the church life is like divorce. Those who cut others off always have reasons, but it is not the way. To claim and exercise authority to cut others off is absolutely wrong. When we cut others off, we actually cut ourselves off. In this age or the next, time will tell that we were wrong to cut others off. If we do not love a person, we should not exercise authority over that one.</p>
<p><em>Question: If a new one in the church life has psychological problems, how much time should we spend caring for that one?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We must walk according to the spirit. If we have the time, we should use it to care for them. If we do not have the time, there is nothing we can do. We also need to remember that we are not the right person, because in ourselves we cannot do anything to help.</p>
<p><em>Question: I fear that I might give so much time to the church that I would completely neglect my family. Would you speak according to your experience concerning this?</em></p>
<p>Answer: I do not think that if we give ourselves to the church, we will completely neglect our families. To do so would be wrong. We must love the church and at the same time do our best to take care of our family. I believe that the church life will help us to take care of our children.</p>
<p><em>Question: Would you share something further concerning walking according to the spirit and the Body life?</em></p>
<p>Answer: If we truly walk according to the spirit, we will spontaneously be in the Body life. If we have problems with the church or with other members, this indicates that at least to some extent we are not walking according to the spirit. If we walk according to the spirit, we will have no problems with others. Nothing will hinder our being joined to others in the Body. We need the experience of Romans 8 in order to enter into the experience of Romans 12.</p>
<p><em>Question: What is shepherding in relation to walking according to the spirit?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should not overanalyze the things pertaining to life. When we overanalyze, life is gone. We should not ask what shepherding is; we should simply go to shepherd. However, after we shepherd others or do anything for the Lord, we must always confess, &ldquo;Lord, I am a useless servant.&rdquo; Whenever we think that we can do something in ourselves, we are finished.</p>
<p><em>Question: As leading ones, how should we encourage the saints to preach the gospel as part of their living of Christ without condemning those who do not?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We should never condemn anyone. If no one in our locality preaches the gospel, we still should not condemn them. We need only to walk according to the spirit and minister such a living to the saints. Then we can follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to speak in the meetings concerning the need to preach the gospel, and we should take the lead to do it. This is good enough. Many matters revealed in the Bible have two sides. On the one side, the Bible reveals that the Lord does things through us and from within us. On the other side, the Bible charges us to do those same things. On the one hand, if the saints walk according to the spirit, they will spontaneously preach the gospel. On the other hand, we need to charge the saints to preach the gospel. As we exhort them, we must also minister to them the life that walks according to the spirit.</p>
<p><em>Question: I have had a heavy burden for many years. What is the best way for me to go on?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We need to humble ourselves and confess to the Lord that we are narrow, religious, proud, and self-confident. It may be difficult to trust in the Lord, but it is easy to trust in ourselves. This is the self. Our narrowness, religiousness, pride, and self-confidence are the source of all our problems, including our problems with our families and the saints, our lack of usefulness to the Lord, and even the heaviness of our burdens, anxieties, and sorrows. If we are not narrow, religious, proud, or self-confident, we will always be joyful and released and will not have a problem with anyone. This is why the Bible charges us to love our enemies (Matt. 5:44). We cannot love others, even our wife and children, if we are narrow, religious, proud, and self-confident.</p>
<p>If we walk according to the spirit, we will not be narrow, religious, proud, or self-confident. If we cannot forgive someone, it indicates that we are narrow and religious, because we are vindicating ourselves. Self-vindication and self-justification are religious. If we are not religious, we will always forgive and forget. The most religious persons are the narrowest persons. Doctrinally speaking, the local churches are not sectarian, but if we are narrow, religious, proud, and self-confident, we will be sectarian in practicality. We must love every believer. </p>
<p>We need to walk according to the spirit, reject our narrowness, religiousness, pride, and self-confidence, and have the basic attitude of love toward all believers. We should be willing to help them and give them whatever we have. What we actually do to care for them should be determined by our walking according to the spirit. If we do not walk according to the spirit, even our trying not to be narrow, religious, proud, or self-confident will be something of our self.</p>
<p><em>Question: What is the best way to help a brother who has been offended?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The best way is not to do anything. We simply need to walk according to the spirit. The walking according to the spirit in Romans 8:4 eventually issues in being led by the Spirit in verse 14. We should not try to think of a way to help a brother. Our help may damage him. If we walk according to the spirit, we will spontaneously be led by the Spirit and will know how to care for him and minister life to him. Our care for others should be something of the Spirit&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p><em>Question: Why have so many Christians missed the focus of the Bible for almost two thousand years?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In order for a chicken to grow, there is the need of feathers, bones, and even dung. However, when we eat the chicken, we eat only the meat. The feathers, bones, and dung are necessary for the chicken to grow so that we can obtain the meat. Similarly, every part of the Bible is necessary, but it is all for the focus&mdash;that the Triune God lives in the believers so that they may live Him. Distraction from the focus of the Bible actually comes not from the other points in the Bible but from the enemy, Satan. Paul says concerning the Jews, &ldquo;Unto this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:15). Such veils are something of the enemy. Therefore, when we read the Bible, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, keep the enemy away from my reading of Your Word.&rdquo; In this way we will come to the healthiest food in the Word.</p>
<p>The Bible is composed as it is because it was written for human beings. God&rsquo;s way is the best way. We could not find a better way to write the Bible. Nevertheless, it is a fact that there are many points in the Word. Preparing a message to share with the saints is like shopping for groceries. No one can eat all the groceries at once. Our intention in publishing the ministry is to release the riches from the Word that have been hidden for centuries. Before 1960 it was difficult for the leading ones to feed the churches because not much of Brother Nee&rsquo;s speaking was published. Since we have published many Life-study messages, the situation today is absolutely different. There are many groceries today. In addition to the printed ministry, there are audio and video recordings of messages.</p>
<p>Today the problem is not a lack of &ldquo;groceries&rdquo; but the ability to discern which portions are best suited for a particular local church. The leading ones are like housewives who must discern the kind of nourishment their children need. No matter how rich the published messages are, the present situation in a local church involves a particular need. The leading ones must know how to minister a word that meets the present local need. For instance, the attendance at certain meetings may be gradually decreasing. The elders need to exercise their spirit to seek the way to deal with such a situation. The elders should consider the local need in selecting the ministry to feed the church.</p>
<p>Sometimes the elders need to do something else to increase the spiritual appetite of the saints. A lack of appetite may indicate sickness. A healthy person has a good appetite and digestion. As caring mothers, the elders should notice when the saints are not eating well and should do something to clear up their digestion and increase their appetite. This is not easy; it depends on our spiritual ability. Nevertheless, we need to find a way to take care of the saints. We should learn by experience, but this requires much time and suffering.</p>
<p>The writings in today&rsquo;s Christianity are inadequate to nourish God&rsquo;s people. The Lord has given us a different way. Any portion of a Life-study message is rich spiritual food for the saints. For the sake of God&rsquo;s economy and His move on the earth, I must labor in the ministry of the word, but this means that I cannot visit the churches regularly even though my heart is with them. However, the leading brothers can care for the churches.</p>
<p>As leading ones, if we mean business with the Lord, we need to walk according to the spirit and minister life to all the saints in our localities. Then all the saints will live a life of testimony and speak Christ, preaching the gospel and spreading the truth everywhere. We have no trust in organization or a great work. We trust in walking according to the spirit, bearing a bright and shining testimony in our daily life, the proper, genuine preaching of Christ, and the spreading of the truth. If all the local churches go on in this way, time will serve the purpose. The Lord&rsquo;s move on the earth will be prevailing.</p>
<p>We must not be narrow or sectarian; rather, we need to love every believer. We should not consider that only those who meet with us are in the local churches. All the believers are in the local churches. We need to avoid opinions and dissension. We cover those who have many opinions; we cannot cut them off. The church life is not like an Asian bean cake, which is cut square and straight. Instead, the church life is like mashed potatoes. There will always be trouble, opinions, complaints, and disorder. All the churches mentioned in the New Testament were like this. Our natural tendency is to cut others off and be divisive. However, we have to embrace everyone, including the troublesome ones. If we are not inclusive, we will damage the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">A WORD OF CAUTION CONCERNING<br />
AMBITION, PRIDE, AND CHARACTER</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we present ourselves to You. We need Your timely help. Examine, enlighten, and expose us. Show us where we are. We need to see You and know Your heart and Your way in Your economy. Lord, we also need Your forgiveness and Your cleansing. Because we are still living in the old creation, we are contaminated by our natural life, strength, way, and wisdom. Lord, we confess that we are still very natural and in darkness. Forgive us and cleanse us of all this with Your precious blood. We look unto You for a transparent fellowship so that nothing remains hidden or covered. Expose our situation and condition. Lord, we ask for Your mercy and grace. We humble ourselves before You. Defeat the power of darkness and the evil one. Leave no ground for him. We stand with You. Lord, we trust in You for the completion of Your word and Your work on us, in us, and among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BEWARE OF AMBITION AND PRIDE</h2>
<p>Humanly speaking, in any group or society people like to be above others. In other words, people like to be special or uncommon. Workers hope to be promoted in their jobs. We all like to be different. Because this tendency or habit is constituted into our being, we may unconsciously and subconsciously bring it into the church life. This word is a necessary inoculation.</p>
<p>In Matthew 23:8 the Lord told His disciples, &ldquo;Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.&rdquo; In verse 10 He said, &ldquo;Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ.&rdquo; In Mark 10:37 James and John said to the Lord, &ldquo;Grant to us to sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.&rdquo; They wanted to be above others, to be different from the other disciples. After hearing this request, the Lord taught His disciples, &ldquo;You know that those who are esteemed as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. But it is not so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be the slave of all&rdquo; (vv. 42-44). Although organized Christianity neglected this crucial word of the Lord, in the 1800s the Brethren paid attention to the Lord&rsquo;s word. Based upon the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in Matthew 23:8, they did away with the clergy and only called one another brothers. Because of this, others began to call them the Brethren.</p>
<p>We should not allow an attitude to come into the church life that the elders are above others. This is ugly. There is no rank in the church. The brothers who are the leading ones should consider themselves to be lower than the other saints. They do not rule others; rather, they are slaves and stewards who serve the church. In Luke 22:25-27 the Lord said, &ldquo;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors. But you shall not be so; but let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves. For who is greater, the one who reclines at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as the one who serves.&rdquo; The churches should not have an atmosphere in which the elders are considered to be greater than the other saints. It is absolutely wrong to think that it is a glory to be an elder. To think this way is a sign that we are not walking according to the spirit. The elders need to help their wives to realize that they are not higher than the other sisters. The wife of an elder is the wife of a slave.</p>
<p>To be regarded as being higher than others in the church according to the secular way is unseemly. When others try to elevate me, I ask them to consider me as only a brother. We should never presume that we are anything. It is a shame if the concept of hierarchical rank or an atmosphere of ambition is brought into the church life. This concept is not justified in the New Testament. The Lord rejected it, and the apostle Paul also depreciated it. If the leading brothers in a locality consider themselves to be higher than others, assume that they are the authority in their locality, rule others, and make themselves different from the other saints, the church in that locality is sick with a dangerous cancer. Our desire to be higher than others may kill the church.</p>
<p>After the Lord fed five thousand with five loaves and two fish in John 6, the people wanted to make Him King (vv. 14-15). However, He would not allow them to enthrone Him, and He immediately withdrew alone to the mountain. Anyone else in His position would probably seize the opportunity to be crowned, believing it to be something of God since it was initiated by others. The next day, after the Lord returned, He told the crowd, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (v. 35). He claimed not to be a great king but a small piece of food. He came not to rule us but to feed and nourish us. We need to have the same humble attitude.</p>
<p>If we do not take this word seriously, one day we will realize our mistake, because our considering ourselves higher than others will damage the church. To be higher than others does not minister life to them. We can exercise our so-called authority only to subdue others temporarily. Those whom we subdue will be our strongest opposers in the future. This is not the way to build the church; rather, it makes us a cancer to the church. Making ourselves higher than others is a sowing, and one day we will reap what we sow. There is no exception to this God-ordained principle (Gal. 6:7). If we receive this word, it will be a great rescue to us.</p>
<p>Concerning the elders not giving the other saints the impression that they consider themselves higher than others, what matters is the elders&rsquo; attitude. Our attitude is basic. For instance, although we should discipline our children, love must be our attitude toward them. The outward things, such as where the elders sit and how much they function in the meetings, do not matter as much as their inward attitude. If our attitude is wrong, whatever we do or say will mean nothing. If a brother is inwardly proud, the other saints will not believe that he is humble even if he says something like, &ldquo;I humble myself before you all.&rdquo; Others will know if a brother is inwardly humble, regardless of what he does or says. Much depends on our attitude.</p>
<p>Paul writes to the Corinthians, &ldquo;I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom...I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:1, 3). Because Paul did not make himself great, some foolish ones belittled him and said that they preferred Cephas or Apollos (1:12). The name Paul means &ldquo;small.&rdquo; The philosophizing Greek believers despised Paul as a little man without much wisdom. Paul was actually well-educated and very wise, but he did not act arrogantly. Instead, he made himself small.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO HAVE A PROPER CHARACTER</h2>
<p>As leading ones, we also need to consider the matter of our character. In 1953 I gave a training on character in Taiwan and shared thirty points of character in ten groups of three. The first group is genuine, exact, and strict. We need to be genuine. A teenager who pretends to be an old man is not genuine, because he is acting like someone he is not. We should be what we are. To be exact is to be accurate and precise. Most people&rsquo;s character is not accurate or precise. In 1947 a serving sister in Shanghai told me, &ldquo;The roof of the meeting hall has a big hole in it and needs to be repaired.&rdquo; In order to get an accurate estimation of the size of the hole, I had to ask her several times, &ldquo;How big?&rdquo; Eventually, it became clear that the hole was not very large. Inaccurate information may cause damage to the church. An elder must have a precise character and be accurate when speaking to others. To be strict is not to be loose.</p>
<p>The second group of character traits is diligent, broad, and fine. After we decide to read the Bible every day, the time we spend reading the Bible may gradually decrease. Such laziness is versus diligence. In writing the footnotes for the Recovery Version of the New Testament, I scheduled a certain number of chapters per week. Although I often finished my scheduled work before the end of the week, my character caused me to continue working rather than relaxing. Before going to bed at night, if we do not put our shoes in the proper place, it indicates that we are lazy and loose. Keeping a clean living place requires a proper character. Those who serve the Lord must be diligent in everything, including caring for their appearance. A brother who does not keep his shoes shined cannot take good care of a church or speak the word of God with impact. When a person is exact, strict, and diligent, he often becomes narrow. He does not forgive others or tolerate looseness or laziness. Toward ourselves, we need to be diligent. Toward others, we need to be broad. We should not criticize or condemn others. Those who are broad are often rough. To be fine is to pay attention to detail. We need to have balancing character traits. We need to be diligent but not small, broad but not rough.</p>
<p>The third group of character traits is stable, patient, and deep. The fourth group is pure, just, and calm. The fifth group is single, corporate, and open. The sixth group is affectionate, ardent, and accommodating. The seventh group is strong, pliant, and submissive. The eighth group is suffering, lowly, and poor. The ninth group is steadfast, enduring, and bearing. The tenth group is clear, magnanimous, and grave. These character traits may serve as a mirror with which we can examine ourselves. We may be surprised by the truth about our character.</p>
<p>In 1965 I traveled with a group of brothers from the United States to Taiwan. The brothers in Manila wrote me a letter asking that I send a brother to preach the gospel in English there. I fellowshipped with one of the brothers who had come with me, and he had the burden to go. The serving ones in Manila provided him with excellent hospitality. One day when he was out, some sisters went into his room to clean. They saw many things tossed carelessly about, including a sock that was on a glass on the desk. This was a great shame. One with such a character cannot be useful in the Lord&rsquo;s work. A loose person cannot do a diligent work. A person always works according to his character.</p>
<p>Character is thirty percent nature and seventy percent habit. We receive our nature by birth, but our habit is built by practice. By birth we may have a quick or slow nature, but our upbringing and culture affect our habits. As a result, two children with the same disposition, or nature, but raised in different cultures will have different characters. A slow Chinese person is very different from a slow American. They may have the same nature by birth but their characters will be different because of their different practices and habits.</p>
<p>Our character affects even our walking according to the spirit. A diligent person who walks according to the spirit will rise up early to have a time in the Word, but a loose person who walks according to the spirit will rise later and spend a shorter time in the Word. An elder who talks to another saint may do so according to the spirit but will speak mostly according to the standard of his character. The same dye applied to different textiles will produce different results. A green dye applied to silk will produce a shining green color. However, the same dye applied to cotton will produce a dull green color. The brightness depends not on the dye but upon the quality of the textile. Similarly, the kind of Christian we are depends not on God&rsquo;s life and nature but on our character. We all need to walk according to the spirit, but our character will make a great difference in the outcome.</p>
<p>According to my experience, for the Lord to regenerate a person is easy, but for the Lord to change a person&rsquo;s character is difficult. We can easily change our mind, but we cannot easily change our character. Once a habit becomes part of our character, it is difficult to change. Before the 1953 training on character in Taiwan, I built a co-workers&rsquo; home near the meeting hall. The first brothers to live in the home attended the 1953 training. In the first year after the training, everything in the home was kept clean, neat, and orderly. However, over several years, the home gradually became sloppy. This shows that it is very difficult to change someone&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>The leading ones in the churches should not assume that because they are elders, their character is up to the standard. We must be careful not to act, speak, or make decisions loosely. We need to be genuine, exact, strict, and diligent in everything. The elders should always arrive at the meetings on time. In the training we require that everyone arrive at the meetings five minutes before the scheduled time. However, I have noticed that when the trainees return to their localities, they do not continue to practice this. Character is not a small thing. Our usefulness to the Lord depends not only on whether we walk according to the spirit but also on our character. Any regenerated person can walk according to the spirit, but only a person with a proper character can walk according to the spirit well.</p>
<p>The more we walk according to the spirit, the more the resurrected human nature of Christ will saturate our fallen human nature and transform our poor character. Nevertheless, when we consider the thirty character traits mentioned above, we will see that our character is lacking and may delay our spiritual growth. This word of inoculation should affect our attitude so that we have no trust in ourselves. We all tend to subconsciously appreciate ourselves and not others. However, when we consider our character, we will see that there is not much to appreciate. We may say that we do not lie, steal, or commit gross sins, but we probably cannot say that we have the thirty character traits mentioned above. We may have a problem with every point. If we have a proper attitude of humility, the Spirit will have the freedom to saturate us.</p>
<p>A good gospel message mainly changes the listeners&rsquo; attitude, which enables them to repent. Formerly, they were self-righteous. When they are convicted, their attitude changes, and the Spirit has an opportunity to work in them. The same principle applies throughout our Christian life. The earlier we begin to practice to improve our character, the more likely it is that we will receive the mercy and grace to be successful. We work and take care of the churches mostly unconsciously according to our character. Two brothers may interpret the Lord&rsquo;s leading in a particular situation differently because their character is different. Thus, we even understand the Lord&rsquo;s leading mostly according to our character.</p></body></html>
