WITH THE ESSENTIAL SPIRIT</h2>
<p>After leading the new ones to call on the name of the Lord, we should immediately lead them to be filled with the essential Spirit. In Acts 13:52 joy is mentioned with the infilling of the Spirit. After calling on the Lord and making a thorough confession, some thought that they should immediately have joy. If we do not pay attention to joy, simply calling on the Lord and making a thorough confession, joy may come. However, if we expect joy to come when we make a thorough confession of our sins, it may never come. Joy is not the unique sign or evidence of our having been filled with the essential Spirit. It is only one of many evidences. But even if we have no apparent evidence, we still have to exercise our spirit and our faith. Second Corinthians 4:13 says that we have a spirit of faith and that we must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak&mdash;&ldquo;I believed, therefore I spoke.&rdquo; We must exercise our spirit to speak, confess, and call, and we must exercise our faith to stand on the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>As we are learning to be filled within with the essential Spirit, we have to exercise our faith. If we have made a thorough confession to the Lord, we must believe that He is working. An experience I had many years ago illustrates this. In 1939 I was invited by my former school to preach the gospel to the students. While I spoke, the Spirit touched one of the teachers, who was also a judge in a local court, very deeply. After the meeting, he told me that he believed what I had preached but that he did not know the way to enter into what I had said. In a brief way I told him to go home, kneel down privately in his bedroom, and pray to the Lord Jesus and to make a thorough confession of his sins. I encouraged him to confess whatever he felt was a sin, and I told him that by making such a confession he would be saved. He took my word and went back home to do what I had told him. He expected something from the heavens to come down upon him, but nothing happened that day, so he was very disappointed. He had prayed, confessed, and asked the Lord to forgive him, but according to his feeling nothing had happened. The next morning he still felt that nothing had happened. But as he was walking on his way to the court, he noticed that his outlook was completely different. He suddenly became very happy. Everything around him was different, and he began to rejoice. He was so happy that he could not control himself. His secretary noticed his joy and asked why he was so happy and joyful. He replied that he did not know why he was so happy, but that he was just happy. Throughout the day, morning to evening, while he was judging the cases in the court, he was happy. When he returned home, his wife was surprised by her husband&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>When he went to school that evening to teach, he asked one of the students who was a brother to explain to him why he had experienced such joy. The brother told him that the joy he experienced was a sign that he had received the Spirit, and that this was an indication that he had been saved. From that time onward, this teacher knew that he was saved. Something had happened, but not according to his expectation. When he expected something, nothing happened; but when he was not expecting anything, something happened. We too must learn as we are being filled with the Spirit, to leave the manifestation of our being filled with the Spirit to the Lord. We simply need to exercise our faith.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We should lead the new ones not only to confess their sins that they might be filled with the Spirit, but also to experience the economical Spirit (Acts 4:8, 31). We must tell them that as new believers they should give testimonies to their family, relatives, neighbors, and friends. We should point out to them that whenever they speak of the Lord Jesus to other people, they should exercise their faith to believe that they have the outpouring of the Spirit. We must lead them into this realization, rather than merely teaching them. If we are such people ourselves, we will then be able to bring this kind of atmosphere, attitude, and spirit to them. Spontaneously and sometimes even unconsciously, we will lead them into the realization and enjoyment of this outpoured Spirit.</p>
<p>We should lead the new ones into calling on the name of the Lord, being filled with the essential Spirit within for life, and experiencing the outpouring of the economical Spirit without for authority. Do not believe that these things are too hard. Humanly speaking, these things are very normal. On the one hand, these things are miraculous to the uttermost; but on the other hand, they are so normal in our experience. Cornelius with his relatives and intimate friends experienced all of these things at the same time (Acts 10:24, 44). They were regenerated, filled with the Spirit within, and experienced the outpouring of the Spirit all at the same time.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Christianity has made regeneration very hard. Some would question whether or not a person could be regenerated in fifteen minutes. It is not time that regenerates people; the Spirit does (John 3:6). Hearing the preaching of the gospel can be likened to taking pictures with a camera. As we preach the gospel using <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> we direct our listener through each point of the booklet, getting him (as we would a camera) into the right position. By the presentation of each point we remove the &ldquo;lens cover&rdquo; from his mind. When everything is ready, the opening of the shutter by a little &ldquo;click&rdquo; allows all the &ldquo;scenery&rdquo; to get into the camera of his being and onto the &ldquo;film,&rdquo; his spirit. It is not time, but the light with the opening of the shutter which brings the scenery into the listener. By our preaching the gospel in this way, many people have experienced regeneration, the infilling of the essential Spirit, and the outpouring of the economical Spirit.</p>
<p>We should not think that it is too early for one who has just been baptized to experience the outpouring of the Spirit. Some who were saved long ago were seeking the outpouring of the Spirit for many years, but their seeking was with much unbelief. Actually, you do not need to spend that much time to be filled with the economical Spirit. You simply need to exercise your faith to believe and to speak with boldness. Then regardless of your feeling, believe that you are under the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> </body></html>
