   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit Being the Flow of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the divine revelation, the Divine Trinity has a source, a course, and a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible says that God is the living water John 4:10, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With this water there is a source, a course, and a flow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Matthew 28:19 says that we are to baptize people into the one name of three persons the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is one name for the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this verse we see three persons God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also see three matters love, grace, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The love of God is the source; the grace out of the love of God is the course; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit is the Triune God's flow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, the Spirit is the Triune God flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit as the flowing of the Triune God may be likened to the current of electricity, the flowing of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The electricity itself and its flow are not two separate matters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are just one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Electricity has a flow, and that is called the current.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Triune God has a flow, and that is called the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit is not only the flow of the Triune God but also the reaching of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The current of electricity is the reaching of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Electricity reaches a house from the power plant by its current.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The flowing is a kind of reaching, and the reaching is a kind of "entering into."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit is the reaching of the Triune God, and this reaching enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit is the Triune God entering into us as the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit Being the Reality</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit is the reality 1 John 5:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is very abstract but very real.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is hard to say whether electricity is abstract or solid.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To say that our God is abstract may be partially right, but our God is also very real.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reality is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit is the reality of God, the reality of Christ John 14:16-20; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:18 , the reality of the word of God John 17:17 , and the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit Being the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His economy, God passed through different stages.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God was in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He was in eternity past, He was merely and solely divine; He did not possess humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But one day about four thousand years after He created man, He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He partook of man's nature, man's blood and flesh Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is another stage of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He became Emmanuel Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He became a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our God, the God of the Christians, is very different from the God of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of the Jews' unbelief in Jesus, their God is merely in divinity, not in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Jews do not believe that Jesus today is their Jehovah in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jehovah in the Old Testament was only God, but Jesus today is God plus man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This man Jesus, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the New Testament, there are two great "becames."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, God became a man, the Word became flesh John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Second, this God-man became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are the different stages of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In eternity past the Spirit of God was merely the Spirit of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But God became a man, and this God-man became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now the Spirit of God is also the Spirit of the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Acts 16:7 speaks of "the Spirit of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of God with the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit of Christ is mentioned in Romans 8:9 and the Spirit of Jesus Christ in Philippians 1:19.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of Jesus Christ are the one Spirit, who includes both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In John 7 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit would be the flow out of the innermost being of a believer v. 38 . Verse 39 says that this Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At that time Jesus was not yet glorified in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He had not yet become the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This life-giving Spirit, whom Jesus became, is the Spirit of God in another stage.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In one stage in eternity past, He was only the Spirit of divinity, without humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But after Jesus' resurrection, the Spirit is now the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Jesus became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, so the Spirit has become the Spirit of Jesus Christ with humanity in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today the Spirit that is within us is not only the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is divine, and He is also human.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is not only human in incarnation but also human in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Today He is such a Spirit.</S>
