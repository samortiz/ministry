<h2 class=head3>4. Defeating Antichrist</h2><p>In His kingdom ministry Christ will defeat Antichrist with his partner, the false prophet, and the nations who follow them in rebelling against God in the war at Armageddon (Rev. 19:11-16). His newly married bride, as His armies, will fight together with Him (19:14; 17:14). Christ and His bride-army will defeat Antichrist and his followers and cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire directly (19:19-21). These two will be the first who will be thrown into the lake of fire, even before Satan. In the meantime, Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (20:1-3). Then the millennial kingdom of Christ will begin (vv. 4, 6). In the millennial kingdom, Christ will reign with all His overcomers as His co-kings, and all the kings will enjoy the same joy that Christ does. This is mentioned by the Lord Himself in the parable given in Matthew 25:14-30. This message needs a lot of study. Otherwise, we will not be able to receive the light and see the revelation.<h2 class=head2>L. Judging the Nations</h2><p>The second thing that Christ will do in His kingdom ministry is to judge, on the throne of His glory, the nations (the living—Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1) who remain at that time: some as goats will be condemned to perish eternally and some as sheep will be justified to enter into eternal life (Matt. 25:31-46). When Christ comes back, the first good people in His eyes will be His believers. Then He will judge them to discern the overcomers and the defeated ones. Later, He will judge the nations who are left after the war at Armageddon to discern who are the sheep, the good ones, and who are the goats, the bad ones. He will throw the goats into the lake of fire. Then Christ will send the good ones, the sheep, into eternal life, not the life itself but into the blessing of the eternal life, to be the nations who will remain around the New Jerusalem. The nations who remain around the New Jerusalem will be these sheep.<p>Christianity’s theology teaches differently from this. They teach that the sheep are saved ones and the goats are false ones. One day if those of us in the recovery are faithful to the Lord, the truths, the real theology, in the Lord’s recovery will defeat all the theology in today’s Christianity and expose it to the uttermost. As a little slave of the Lord burdened to speak for Him, I must tell people the truth. I must be honest and faithful to what my Lord has shown me. What we have seen depends upon the foregoing faithful interpreters of the Bible. They have passed on their seeing to us and this has become our seeing. Thus, the recovery’s theology is the genuine theology of all the foregoing faithful interpreters.<h2 class=head2>M. The End of the Millennial Kingdom</h2><p>At the end of the millennial kingdom, Satan will be released and will deceive the nations again to rebel against God; the nations will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10). The rebellious nature of fallen man will remain in man until the end of the millennial age. At the end of the kingdom, God temporarily will release Satan, who will seduce the nations again to fight against God. Then they will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire.<p>Through all the above judgments Christ will clear up all the opposers of God from this earth; this consummates His kingdom ministry. Without such a kingdom ministry, how could the earth created by God be cleared up to be good for God’s kingdom? There is the need of such a kingdom ministry of Christ to clear the earth from all the opposing factors of man plus Satan.<h2 class=head2>N. After the Millennium</h2><p>After the millennium, Christ will be at His great white throne to judge all the dead throughout the generations and cast them into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:11-12, 15). Thus, Christ will clear up the entire universe, preparing the way for the new heaven and new earth to come.<h2 class=head2>O. The Holy City in the New Heaven and New Earth</h2><p>The new heaven and new earth will come, in which the holy city, New Jerusalem, is manifested for God’s eternal enlargement and expression (Rev. 21:1-2).
