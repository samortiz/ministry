   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES 2 Issue No. 5, March 1926</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Editor's note: This column considers world events from the scriptural view.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is for the purpose of showing the imminent return of the Lord, and not for ascertaining the date of His return.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Last summer the World Council of Churches called a conference in the capital of Sweden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I remember correctly, China also sent representatives to the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The main organizers of the conference were so-called modernists.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the end of the conference, they issued a declaration which, though it mentioned the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, did not tell what the truth of the gospel is!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The purpose of the conference was to unite all the churches of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet the conference did not affirm what we believe in. Cardinal doctrines such as the inspiration of the Bible, the virgin birth, the vicarious death for redemption, the gospel of the shedding of the blood, and the physical resurrection were, according to my knowledge, not mentioned at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If some would mention these things, others in the meeting would ask them to sit down!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us quote a portion of their declaration:</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are indeed thankful for the opportunity at this time to have so many churches to come together, to love one another, to exercise restraint, and to discuss many problems selflessly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen the gospel of Christ practiced in the many facets of the human life, in commerce, in society, in politics, and in the urgent needs of the international community.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In economics, we realize that the highest of all pursuits is in spiritual things, which should not be considered as less important than material things and the mechanization of industry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why we demand that spiritual things be given the highest right, the right to be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason we are fighting for a free and full development of human rights.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the name of the gospel, we attest to the fact that industrialization should not be for individual gains, but should be a service to society...There should be cooperation in place of mutual competition, so that capitalists and laborers can have industrialization as the common goal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We went on to discuss moral and social problems, such as over-population, unemployment, decline of morality, drinking and its evil, and the cause of lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the end we recognized the seriousness of these problems and realized that they cannot be solved by individuals, but must be a responsibility borne by society as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What they are saying is in the same principle as what the Society for the Promotion of Christianity says, which is to change the redemptive gospel of the Lord's shed blood to that of a research of problems of industrialization!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that there is no need for a personal regeneration, and that as long as society is reformed, everything is all right!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is to try to take the Christian principle as leaven and to leaven the whole society!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is to improve this world for the purpose that sinners can live in it forever!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In these days, everywhere we hear people clamoring for church unity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Babylon the Great of Revelation 17 is about to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Alas, what is the use of talking about unity in outward forms if we neglect the scriptural principle?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are seeing the great whore being formed before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who truly love the Lord should come out Rev 18:4 and should wait for their rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>NEXT YEAR'S CONFERENCE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Next August a great conference will be held in Lausanne for all the churches in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the Protestant churches will send delegates to this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This conference was initiated by the Reformed ______ Church in Cincinnati and has been held once every three years since 1910.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The goal of this conference is to unite the churches of different countries.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First it tries to unite the Protestant churches of all the countries.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Greek Orthodox Church is also helping this movement.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is news that the Roman Catholic Church was asked to join this conference also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Geneva, Mr. ______ a modernist called the Roman Catholic Church "the mother church that includes all churches," and said that there is a "great movement of a return to Roman Catholicism" among the ______.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Prior to the European War World War I , Pope Pius X issued a statement that he was greatly interested in this movement and promised to pray for this movement.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said that for a long time he had hoped for the Protestant churches to be united with the mother church, the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1919 a delegation was sent to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Pope Benedict XV received these guests courteously and thanked them for coming to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the Pope told them that the Roman Catholic Church could not attend their conference.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said, "I am the descendant of St. Peter, and the representative of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My greatest hope is that there will be one flock, with one shepherd."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He referred to the Roman Catholic Church as the one flock, and to himself as the one shepherd!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In these days men are trying to negotiate with the Pope again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As students of prophecy, we realize that in the future all the churches will be united and will line up behind the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At present, the tendency is already evident.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who seek after the Lord honestly and who desire to keep the truth must not associate themselves with this movement.</S>
