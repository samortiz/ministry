        <h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST<br />
MANIFESTING ONLY CHRIST</h2>
<p>A person&rsquo;s body cannot convey the thoughts and ideas of another person. A person&rsquo;s body is his manifestation; that is, a person is expressed through his body. A person is manifested not only through his face; he is manifested through every move of his body. Hence, it is often possible to recognize someone by the way he walks or even when we can see only his back. Similarly, the church is the Body of Christ, the expression of Christ; hence, the church can manifest only Christ. Christ lives in the church and is expressed through the church. Man cannot find God apart from Christ, nor can man find Christ apart from the church. In the universe there is a God, and this God is in Christ; in the universe there is Christ, and this Christ is in the church. When the God of the heavens came to be among men, He was in Christ, but today when Christ appears to the world, He is in the church. The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ lives in the church. Wherever the church is, there should be the expression of Christ.</p>
<p>A few years ago I was in London, and a friend took me to see the Queen&rsquo;s vine, which grows in a huge glass house. He told me that the Queen&rsquo;s vine is the largest vine in the world. The Queen&rsquo;s vine, however, is not the largest vine in the world. There is a vine on the earth that is much larger than the Queen&rsquo;s vine. The Queen&rsquo;s vine can be contained in a huge glass house, but the globe is not large enough for the vine that is revealed in the Bible. This great vine is Christ and the church. The Lord is the vine, and the believers are the branches (John 15:5). The church is Christ&rsquo;s vine, and the branches of this vine are spreading throughout the earth. Wherever there is a proper church, there is the manifestation of Christ. May we all see this vision: the church is not a social group; the church is the Body of Christ, the church is filled with Christ, and the church is the embodiment of Christ. The church is filled with the element of Christ and expresses Christ.</p>
<p>When we were saved and entered into the church, we were buried. The church did not bury us after we had been saved for a long period of time. Rather, we were buried the very moment that we entered into the church. Hence, the church does not express something of our self; the church expresses only Christ. The church does not allow the self to occupy any place. The church lets Christ have the first place in all things. In the church there is no room for human opinions, views, propositions, or actions. This is the only way that the church can be full of the divine life. To be full of the divine life is to be full of Christ. The church is the expression of Christ, the Body of Christ, and the fullness of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The church being the Body of Christ is not easy to understand, and the church being the fullness of Christ is even more difficult to understand. When I was young, I failed to understand how the church could be the fullness of Christ, the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). One day I asked an experienced brother why the church is the fullness of Christ. This brother used the Lord&rsquo;s Word to show me that God created Adam and then took a rib from Adam&rsquo;s side and built it into Eve (Gen. 2:21-22). A part of Adam became Eve. Eve was a part of Adam, so Eve was Adam&rsquo;s fullness. Adam needed Eve as his fullness. Adam was not full without Eve, just as a man without a wife does not have a fullness. Hence, the church being the fullness of Christ means that without the church Christ does not have a fullness.</p>
<p>In the Epistle to the Ephesians Paul says that the church is the Body of Christ and that the church is the fullness of Christ (1:23). A man with a big head but a small body does not have a fullness. A person&rsquo;s fullness depends on whether he has a proper body. The church should be the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, but during the past two thousand years the church has lost its proper expression. For example, it is not easy to see a proper church in Japan, and it is also not easy to find proper churches in the so-called Christian countries, such as the United States and Great Britain. The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>The expression of Christ that we see in the Gospels becomes fuller in the book of Acts. The church at the time of Pentecost, at the time of the apostles, was truly the expression of Christ. When the church was spreading to many localities, Christ was spreading, because the expression of Christ was appearing in many localities. The church is not a social organization, nor is it a group of people who are pursuing individual spirituality. Rather, the church is composed of saved persons who are full of Christ and who have become the mysterious Body of Christ as the fullness of Christ. The individual Christ in the Gospels is the corporate Christ in Acts. The Head lives and is expressed through the Body. The Head and the Body share the same life and the same element. If we would read Acts from the viewpoint of the fullness of Christ, we will see what the true condition of the church should be.</p>
<p>Acts does not merely show us how the believers preached the gospel and received the Holy Spirit. Acts shows us the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ. After His resurrection and ascension, Christ came as life to those who belonged to Him. These ones, who belonged to Christ, had died through the cross and had been buried. When they came together in the Spirit, they were the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ. They had God&rsquo;s presence, authority, power, and blessing. Hence, it was easy for them to lead people to be saved. Moreover, it was easy for the early believers to be spiritual and to meet God, because they were full of Christ, and they let Christ gain ground in them. God desires to have such a church, a church that is the embodiment of Christ and the fullness of Christ.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
