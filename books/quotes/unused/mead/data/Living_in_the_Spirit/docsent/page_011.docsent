   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD ENTERING INTO MAN TO HAVE ONE LIFE AND ONE LIVING WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not treat this matter as a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, we should all receive a real impression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We want to see a mysterious vision in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is a vision, and what is a revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I were to cover my face with a veil, you would be unable to see my face.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, there would be no revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation is like the removing of the veil to expose my face.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if there was revelation but no light or sight, you still would be unable to see my face.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You would know that something has been revealed, but you would not know what that thing was.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there was light here and you also had sight, then upon removing the veil, you would immediately see my face.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My face would be a vision to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A vision is a scene that is uncommon or extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Gospel of John is a book of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we need the light to shine on the revelation, and we also need the sight to see.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we need to look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The revelation of the Gospel of John has been opened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, we still need the Lord's shining, and we also need the Lord to give us spiritual sight that we may see the scene in this book and receive a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospel of John is about God, who is the Creator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The purpose of this book is to show how this God works Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How does God accomplish this?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The best way for us to take something into us is by eating it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Does God then need to divide Himself into tiny pieces?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Initially there was no way for us to eat God, because as the Creator, God is mysterious, incomprehensible, great, and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If He came to us as the Creator, we would fall down in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the Gospel of John reveals that first the Word was God: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God" 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What are words for?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Words are for expression and explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the book of John, the mysterious and hidden God is expressed as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the Word, Christ speaks forth and expresses the mysterious and hidden God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If someone does not know God, he only needs to come to Christ, who is the explanation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, God became flesh, a man v. 14 . The great and glorious God became a man so that men could draw near to Him without fear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Third, this God in the flesh was the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man is sinful, but God is holy, and God cannot contact anything that has sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, as the Lamb of God He carried our sins to the cross and dealt with them there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the cross He accomplished redemption by the shedding of His blood, and then He was buried.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then, something wonderful transpired, something that had never occurred in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After His burial He resurrected, and in His resurrection He still had a human body, but He also became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then He came to where the disciples were, and even though the doors were shut, He entered without knocking on the door and without anyone opening the door for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, He did not even enter the room; He simply came and stood in their midst 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His mysterious body was simply beyond our comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As He was standing in the midst of the disciples, He did not preach to them or give them a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, He breathed into them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" v. 22 . In this way He entered into them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God entered into the disciples to become one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The two God and man, man and God became one, having one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through the Spirit, God can live in man, and man can live by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Gospel of John clearly tells us that God is Spirit 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because He is Spirit, He can enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Long before He entered into man, He prepared a spirit for man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man has a spirit within him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This book tells us that the spirit within man needs regeneration 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It needs to be regenerated with God as the Divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this way the Divine Spirit can be begotten in the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only so, this book tells us that this God as the mysterious One is not only our life but also our bread of life 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, we can eat Him and take Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, we do not eat Him in the same way we eat bread.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" v. 63 . This means that we need to receive the Lord's words with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then we will have Him, and He will be the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eventually He said that those who eat Him will live because of Him v. 57 . We do not live by ourselves but by the Spirit whom we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must see what kind of book the Gospel of John is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It shows us that after going through the process of incarnation, death, and resurrection, God became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All we need to do is exercise our spirit to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then He enters into our spirit to be mingled with us as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He becomes our life and life supply, and we live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The two He and we, we and He have one life, one living, and one walk.</S>
