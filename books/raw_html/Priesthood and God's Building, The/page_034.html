        <h2 class="head1">TURNING OUR BEING TO PRAY<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Every time we come forward to God to fellowship, pray, read the Bible, and even sing, we need to turn our being to our spirit. If you ask what you need to turn from, I would say, &ldquo;You know.&rdquo; Sometimes our thoughts are in one place, and a few seconds later they are in another place. It seems as if our thoughts can travel as fast as a jet plane. It is difficult to pray and draw near to God in this condition. If we want to fulfill our priestly service through prayer, we must turn from the thoughts that fly wildly through our mind.</p>
<p>Some people say that when they pray, they shut the door of their room. While it may be easy to shut a door, it is hard to turn our being back to our spirit. Even though a door may be closed, thoughts are still flying around in our mind. We may even close our eyes, but our thoughts can still fly from the United States to Japan. When we wander in this way, we cannot pray or read the Bible.</p>
<p>We must practice turning our being to our spirit, until we are skilled in this matter. When I was young, it was hard for me to learn how to ride a bicycle. Whenever I tried to ride, I would immediately fall over. When I asked others to help me, they said, &ldquo;The only way to learn is to keep trying. When you ride and fall, you just need to begin to ride again. Eventually, you will not fall.&rdquo; After I heard this word, I practiced until I acquired the skill of riding a bicycle. We can learn to turn our being by practicing to turn our being. If we practice, we will learn. God is not only on the throne, but He is also in our spirit. We need to focus on fellowshipping with the God in our spirit. If we want to pray, we must turn to our spirit. This is the first thing that we need to practice.</p>
<p>When we turn our being to our spirit, we should not rely upon any consideration related to the content of our prayer. When we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, the things that we need to pray about will be added to us. This can be likened to going to a market to buy some vegetables but then being given some more vegetables as a bonus. We do not need to worry about the content of our prayer. We just need to pray according to our inward inspiration. What we sense inwardly, we should speak outwardly. If we have a sense of joy within, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am very happy.&rdquo; If we have a sense of pain within, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am hurting.&rdquo; Genuine prayer comes out of the genuineness of a person.</p>
<p>Regrettably, we often have two &ldquo;faces&rdquo; when we pray to God. For example, we may have a sense of a particular sin, but instead, we pray about other matters, such as the illness of our wife, saying, &ldquo;Lord, my wife is ill in the hospital. Please take care of her.&rdquo; A prayer that does not come out of the genuineness of a person may not be answered by God. If we have a sense regarding a sin, we need to confess the sin before we pray about anything else.</p>
<p>When we truly learn how to pray, speaking what we feel inwardly and touching the inner fountain of life, we will touch Christ, and the living water from the throne will flow out freely. The priesthood comes out of eating, drinking, enjoying, and being filled with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FUNCTIONING AS PRIESTS TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>If we function as priests every day, we will enjoy Christ inwardly and express Christ outwardly. Spontaneously, we will also be living in the church and bearing the church. We will be persons in Christ and in the church. Furthermore, the riches of God will flow through us, and the glory of God will be expressed through us. We will bear His image and exercise His dominion as royal priests, as the dwelling place of God, the building of God.</p>
<p>We must learn to burn incense and light lamps before God. We must learn to draw near to God, pray to God, and read the Word of God. Then, as we are filled with Him inwardly, we will open our mouth to speak and sing. Our mouth should always be open. Our mouth should always be full of praises, songs, and rich utterances. If this is our situation, the living water will flow freely among us, and the riches of God will become our reality. This will build up the church as the dwelling place of God and the building of God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
