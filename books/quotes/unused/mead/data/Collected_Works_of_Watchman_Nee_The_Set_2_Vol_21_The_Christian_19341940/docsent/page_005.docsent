   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"Why this waste?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For this could have been sold for much and given to the poor" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Judas was the first to say this, and the disciples followed and echoed his words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The record about Judas in the Gospel of John is not found in the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Judas was a true economist.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever economy enters our heart, love leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the relationship between Christ and us becomes a matter of economy, love is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The concern of many people today is, "What result will I get if I do this?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Will I be of greater use if I will do that?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the Lord's question is, "Was this done for My sake?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is telling us one thing: "For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a very serious word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, He is telling us that there will be much time for us to work, but the opportunity to love Him is only here while the Lord is living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today is the only time for us to express our love to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the millennium, there will be plenty of opportunity for us to work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 25 tells us that if a man is faithful in the small things, the Lord will entrust great things to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kingdom is the time when we will do great things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many poor people are with us, and there are many works waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But where is our love for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am not saying that we will not love the Lord in eternity anymore, but I am saying that the opportunity to demonstrate our love to Him is today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In that day, it will not be a thing of surprise for us to see the Lord and love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is precious is for us to love Him today without seeing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have not seen the Lord, yet we believe in Him and we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the eyes of love, nothing that we do is too much if we are doing it for the Lord; nothing that we sacrifice or spend is a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the eyes of the world, it was impractical, wasteful, and foolish for Mary to throw away three hundred denarii in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Judas was more down-to-earth, practical, wise, and thoughtful about humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the Lord would rather see the church filled with foolish Marys than see one wise Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once and for all the Lord laid down the rule of judgment for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Should the principle of the church life be one of loving Christ or one of pragmatism?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is another thing which we should consider.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should be careful not to exercise our soulish power or fleshly energy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should restrict and control ourselves, not working according to our own wisdom or strength in order to expand or prosper our work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many people are doing things which are seemingly for the Lord, but are actually not.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems that their work is for the hastening of Christ's kingdom; actually it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a pity that many such works are done in the principle of selling the ointment to give to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What use is it if we can give to fifty, five hundred, five thousand, or even fifty thousand poor, but the Lord's head remains without the ointment?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Men today like to care for the poor the sinners, the church, the work, etc. and are negligent of the ointment on the Lord's head.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How much of our work is done to please the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How much of our work is done because of need?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a lack of talented ones who are being wasted on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thank the Lord that since the time of the Lord Jesus until now, there have been many who are willing to waste themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul was one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He reached prominence in Judaism at a very young age.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He would surely have gone down in Jewish history as a bright star of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But he ended up being a disciple of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Was that not a waste?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was taught by Gamaliel and well educated in philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He could have studied more philosophy, and could very well have become one of the most famous philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet he chose to become a disciple of a Galilean carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Was that not a waste?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We find many men like him throughout the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we had put these talented, knowledgeable, eloquent, and thoughtful people into politics, literary work, commerce, philosophy, and science, they would surely have become outstanding people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But they did what the world considered as a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thank the Lord that Christ is worthy of all their waste!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These people are just flasks of ointment poured out on the Lord's head.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The world says that these people have been wasted, and some in the church also consider them as wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is possible to be in the so-called churches today and be a person who is not "wasted."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many people have introduced pragmatism into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They calculate cost and talk about profit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their thoughts are on the work and not on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Their concern is the need and not the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Their eyes are on the result, the number of souls saved, the number of people helped, and not on strict obedience to the will of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord has to open our eyes to see that pragmatism is something the Lord rejects.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank the Lord that while we are living today, we do not have to be concerned with the poor or everything represented by the poor; all we have to be concerned about is the Lord's pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Otherwise, it would be hard for those who are not wise and calculating.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The great danger of pragmatism is that it replaces the Lord's pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is a little better than the unclean things of the world, but it falls short of the Lord's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Ignorant ones can easily be led to believe that pragmatism is a philosophy that pleases the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The concern among the churches today is how great can a work become, how much work can be shown in a report, and whether or not there are substantial benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the eyes of worldly economics, Judas was better than Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In their eyes, Judas's way would take care of the poor, help them survive for months, and bring profit to many.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Judas was for pragmatism, and he was better than Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But the goal of salvation is not that we would go to heaven, but that we would be brought into a proper relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It does not concern our earthly relationships, but our relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is possible for a man to save many souls, give much to the poor, and render help to many, yet be rebuked by the Lord as having lost the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A man can have work, labor, and good conduct yet, at the same time, lose out on one thing, which is love.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Suppose a wife is busy all day long for her husband and submissive to him, yet at the same time, she loves another man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Would you want to have such a wife?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You would probably rather have a wife who is slower and sloppier at her work but who is fully for you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You will not be pleased if she works for you while her heart is for someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Similarly, God is not pleased with our giving money to thirty or fifty poor ones.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He is not pleased with our great works and numerous services to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God only wants us to pour out our hearts to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should realize these two great principles: one involves the highest joy of those who pour out everything, heart and soul, to the Lord; the other involves those who say that they are for the Lord, but whose hearts are for the work and their "usefulness."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Today men want to be "useful"; they are afraid that they will lose their "usefulness."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Thank the Lord that there are some on earth today who are not "useful."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Thank the Lord that some have wasted their "usefulness" so that Christ would gain something in them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I have mentioned Miss M. E. Barber many times.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To me, no one living on earth today is as much like Mary as she was.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>She indeed wasted herself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When she was carried to the grave at her burial, one brother spoke on the story of Mary and said that Miss Barber, like Mary, had done all that she could.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I agree with that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>She was indeed a Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I know of very few people in this world like her.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>While she was still alive, I asked her once, "What is the qualification to work?"</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>She answered, "The qualification to work is to be willing to not work for the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When a man is willing to be "shut behind doors," to be insignificant for the Lord's sake, he is worthy to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>"She has done a noble deed to Me" Matt 26:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>"She has done what she could" Mark 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In other words, Mary laid down all that she had.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We need to calculate the cost and spend everything on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In other words, we should waste everything on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we have not wasted ourselves completely on Him, we have not done enough yet.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Thank the Lord that many people could have been very useful if they had not wasted themselves on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>They could have become a famous writer, scientist, or doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But they wasted themselves totally on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>God is calling men to waste themselves on Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Friends, have you done all that you can do?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The Lord said that Mary had done what she could!</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Have you done what you can?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Wherever the gospel is proclaimed, the waste is also proclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Wherever the gospel is proclaimed, many useful and great works of men will be stripped away for the Lord's sake, and the desire for result and fruit will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Wherever the gospel is proclaimed, everything is poured on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Whatever is poured on Christ is not a waste, but will bring genuine fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Thank the Lord that the poor and works count little.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The point is not how much the poor will benefit or how much society and the nation will benefit, but what the Lord will gain.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Today in the church, men ask what the poor, the society, and the nation will gain.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>But we should ask what the Lord will also gain.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>May the gospel be preached here and the story of Mary also be preached here, and may more Marys be raised up here.</S>
