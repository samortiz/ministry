   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Fifth Way to Hell:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Refusing the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible also tells us of another way to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This way to hell is very clean; it is not as filthy as the previous ways.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This way is to refuse the gospel of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us read two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Rendering vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They will pay the penalty of eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His strength" 2 Thes 1:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Eternal destruction" means the suffering of being eternally in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse tells us the reason that some go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who do not obey the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ will go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible is very explicit about this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not the Lord Jesus coming to serve humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not His coming to teach or preach lofty ideas such as freedom, equality, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Neither is it His coming to be a good pattern and a great example.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God tells us through the apostle that "the gospel...I delivered to you, first of all, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures" 1 Cor 15:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From this we see that the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why did He die?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was not to serve as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nor was it a martyr's act or a sacrifice for His service.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, it was "for our sins."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that even though Christ was without sin, the sinless One became sin on our behalf and stood in the place of the sinner, suffering the punishment of the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All sins are committed by us; Christ has committed no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are the sinners; He is not a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But He, not we, suffered the punishment of the sinner and bore the sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sinless Christ died for the sinful sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The gospel says that a Savior came to save sinners and suffered all the punishment for sinners; therefore, sinners do not have to suffer punishment anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The gospel does not exhort men to improve, reform, repent, or change for the better before they can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The gospel tells men that Jesus Christ has accomplished salvation, and that sinners do not have to do anything anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no need to add any work to His perfect salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All that a sinner has to do is to accept the salvation God has prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is all that is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jesus Christ did not just die for sinners to forgive man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He also resurrected for sinners to justify sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why Romans 4:25 says, "Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His death is a negative work, removing the punishment for our sins so that we would no longer be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His resurrection is a positive work, giving us a new position before God, justifying us, and causing God to acknowledge us as a just person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Forgiveness means that sin, although present, is forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Justification means that there is no more sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not just forgiveness; this is to stand on the ground where there is no need for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are completely justified; there is no more sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what Jesus' resurrection has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everyone in the world is dead; no one is resurrected, for the wages of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus has also died, but He has resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This shows that God has accepted His death for us and has acknowledged that He is sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, on the one hand, we are forgiven through the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the other hand, we are proven to be justified through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Justification is based on forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First there is forgiveness, then justification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Through the death of the Lord Jesus, we are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, we receive the proof of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now everything is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every sinner can be immediately forgiven and justified in a second by believing in the Lord Jesus as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Have you heard this?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Jesus Christ has died for your sins and resurrected for you to be the surety of your justification.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Have you heard this?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God has now charged the whole world to obey His gospel, the gospel of grace, so that every sinner can have the opportunity to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Are you willing to obey this gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you want to go to hell, it is very easy!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You do not have to sin, commit adultery, or be proud anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I can tell you that you do not have to sin anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>While you are sitting and listening to my preaching, there is a way for you to go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As long as you do not obey the gospel, you are going to hell already!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Why sin anymore?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is enough, fully enough, for you to go to hell if you reject the Lord Jesus' death for you and refuse to accept Him as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not think that you have to commit any more sin before you are qualified to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You are qualified enough!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You need do nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is enough as long as you do not listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not think that everyone who goes to hell is laden with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Actually there are many religionists, moralists, philanthropists, and social reformers in hell!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A man can be very moral, good, kind, and upright and still be in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What awaits him is death and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He is there for one reason alone; he has not obeyed the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>No morality or religion in this world can save men.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Only God's gospel of grace can save men.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Rejecting this gospel is rejecting the unique way to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Those who do this will surely go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A man may be good, but he cannot be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is impossible for him to be without sin for a second in his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If he has sinned once, or for one second, he has to have a Savior because he will be punished for his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If he rejects the Savior preached to him through the gospel, he causes himself to deserve to be judged and go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Do not think that you can escape hell by doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The only way would be for you to never sin in acts, words, and thoughts even for a second from the time you were born until you die.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>No matter how well you do, as long as you sin for just a second and do not obey the gospel, that very fact will qualify you for hell.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Even if you have never heard the gospel before, you have at least heard it today.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I advise you to accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior this very moment!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord Jesus' death and resurrection has accomplished salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What we are preaching now is this gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Why is it the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is the gospel because it is possible for every sinner in the world to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Lord Jesus has died for all sinners and all the sins of the sinners have been crucified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Everyone who is willing to accept Him as Savior will be spared the punishment and oppression of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Man's way is to work things out gradually, to do the best to improve himself, and to accumulate merit, hoping that he will be saved in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But this is not the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is actually a tiding of woe.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>How many people in the world can improve themselves and save merits for the future?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we are saved through our own good works, our goodness must be perfect, flawless, and spotless before we can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Otherwise, our goodness becomes a sin in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Furthermore, if we want to be saved through our own righteousness, our righteousness must be so high that it reaches heaven before God will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Even our own conscience would condemn us at night in a self-examination, for it would reveal that the good works were done for the self, our name, and many other improper motives within.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Will not God be more displeased with them?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If this is the case, how many can be saved by their own righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I am afraid not even one!</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Can you be so righteous that God will be satisfied, not just yourself or your neighbor?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If you cannot do this, it would be a tiding of woe if you are told to be saved through works of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Thank and praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>He never asks us to do what is difficult actually impossible .</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He knows us.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is why He caused His Son to die for us and to bear the punishment of all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We do not have to try to be good gradually, hoping to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Once we believe in Him and accept Him as our personal Savior, we receive eternal life right away.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This does not mean that a person who has believed in the Lord Jesus does not need to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>It means that we cannot be saved through doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Salvation is fully by God's grace Eph 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>However, after we are saved, the Lord will give us a new life, which will spontaneously do good.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>First we are saved and then we do good, rather than first doing good and then being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Is there anyone who is oppressed by sin here?</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Is there anyone who trembles and fears when he considers his state after death?</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Does your conscience tell you that you are a sinner?</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Are you afraid of death and judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Heartbroken sinners, salvation is here today!</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The Lord Jesus is here to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Come to Him just as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>He will save you.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>He said He would not reject any who come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I only fear that you will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Do not fear that He will not receive you.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Now you no longer have the excuse that you have not heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>You have heard it.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The only question is, will you obey it now?</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>The gospel has presented the Savior to you and has told you the way to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>All you have to do is receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>The question now is whether or not you will.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>If you perish, it will not be due to the many sins you have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Rather, it will be due to your disobedience to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>You are sick and dying.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Someone has given you a bottle of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>The medicine will guarantee your healing.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>But you will not take the medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>If you die, it will not be due to your sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>It will be due to your refusal to take the healing medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>It is true that you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>But here is a Savior who specializes in saving sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>If you perish now, it will be due to your refusal to accept the Savior of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>It will not be due to your sins!</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Today many are perishing and going to hell, not because they sin, but because they reject the Savior of the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Therefore, do not let the Savior say to you, "You are not willing to come to Me that you may have life" John 5:40 .</S>
