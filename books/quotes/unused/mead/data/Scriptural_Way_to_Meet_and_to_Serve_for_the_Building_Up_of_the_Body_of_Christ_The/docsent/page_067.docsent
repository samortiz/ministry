   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Building Up Home Meetings and Group Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The subjective way of practice also includes building up home meetings Acts 2:46; 5:42 and group meetings Acts 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people do not like to come to a big meeting, but we can send the meeting to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They will be very grateful to us for this, and they will welcome this kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To set up home meetings, however, is not an easy matter to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To merely go to people s homes and open the Bible, sing a hymn, and pray is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 2 tells that at the beginning of the church life, the three thousand who were baptized began immediately to meet in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek text for Acts 2:46 indicates that they met not merely from house to house but according to their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that there were as many meetings as there were homes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Each home had a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We spent much time in Taipei to consider how we can carry out prevailing home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To bring people to salvation is one step, to help them to meet in the homes is another step, and to group them together to bring them further on the way to the church life is still another step.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not so easy to set up home meetings in a prevailing way and it is even more difficult to group them together to bring them fully into the church life, not in the old way but in the biblical, God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Speaking and Listening to One Another</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The third factor in the subjective aspect of practice is that we meet by speaking and listening to one another in mutuality 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must have meeting after meeting full of speaking and listening to one another, full of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Building Up the Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>for the Building Up of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The final factor of the scriptural way in the subjective aspect of practice is the building up of the local churches for the building up of the Body of Christ Acts 9:31; Eph 4:12, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not build up the local churches, we cannot build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need to know and experience Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit day after day, having an abundance of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to knock on people s doors, visiting them with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must pay a price for this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes we will suffer persecution and doors may be slammed in our face.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also have to learn how to build up home meetings and group meetings with the intention to build up a proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Finally, we have to build up the universal Body of Christ through the building up of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have no choice but to take this scriptural, inclusive way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to labor gradually and positively in this way to reach God s goal the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise the Lord for the inclusiveness of the scriptural way!</S>
