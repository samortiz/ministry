Chapters one, five, and nine are messages which were given to the elders in Taipei on March 15, April 5, and April 19
Chapters two through four are messages which were given to the church in Kaohsiung at a conference on April 1 and 2
Chapters seven and eight are messages which were given to the church in Taipei during two conference meetings on April 16 and 23
May they desire to have more and more experience in the new way, to taste more of Your riches, and to behold more of Your glory
In the Old Testament, God saved the children of Israel out of Egypt, saying, 'I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself
Because of this, in the Old Testament there was a separation between the clergy, which were the priests, and the ordinary people
In the New Testament, we see in 1 Peter 2 that 'you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession'
We who are saved and are cleansed by the precious blood of the Lord are separated by God specifically to be His priests
For this reason, in the New Testament, God reiterated His intention to make every one of His children a member of the priesthood
Unfortunately, the failure of God's people in the Old Testament was repeated by His people in the New Testament
As a result, God had to change His way of making the whole nation the priests to one of making the house of Aaron the priests
In the New Testament age, the separation between the clergy and the laity has gradually become a custom and a tradition
In Christianity today, the terms clergy and laity are very frequently used and are subjects which are often talked about by people
Using the church in Taipei as an example, those who actually function in the priesthood are less than one third in number
These works include cleaning, serving the bread and the wine at the Lord's table, ushering, and other practical affairs
John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized
We know that the most important work of the New Testament priests is to offer the sinners to God at the altar of the cross
In the Holy Place, there was the arranging of the showbread, the lighting of the lamps, and the burning of the incense
The offering in the Holy Place through the showbread, the golden lampstand, and the golden altar in Colossians 1 is the progressive offering
The work of the evangelists in Ephesians 4 is not mainly a work of preaching but a work of perfecting the saints
One item in this work is to gain the sinners and to minister Christ into them so that Christ within them would become their eternal hope
He brought in the Gentiles, offering them up as sacrifices, and was an example to these saved believers in everything
By then, he should immediately be brought to the small group meetings to be in touch with other brothers and sisters
But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all'
Today we can say that the basic framework is here in the church in Taipei; the church is now on the right track
In addition to a revival every morning and overcoming every day, you must pray, follow the Spirit, live Christ, and labor diligently
Either you should go out to preach the gospel by visiting people, or you should go to home meetings or small group meetings
As long as we would plan a little and devote two evenings out of each week to the Lord, we can surely accomplish something
Now we are very clear that the first work of the New Testament priest is to bring in the sinners and offer them up as offerings
They will not know anything about the religious worship service but will only know how to meet in this kind of organic way
In a district meeting on the Lord's Day morning, if fifteen people would stand up to speak on fifteen points, the meeting will be rich
As long as we all would strive, the new way will not only be here with a basic framework but will be rich in its content as well
In this way, the reality of 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 will be fulfilled among us in a living way, and God's goal will be attained
In the same way, when we mention the new way, there is a distinction between its outward aspect and its inward aspect
Another example is that we used to meet in one kind of way, and now we have changed to meet in another kind of way
It is true that in the Old Testament as well as the New, there are definite ways to carry out all of God's commandments and instructions
When we go to the homes of the new brothers and sisters and feed them with spiritual food, this is what we call the home meetings
If we use sixty as a base number, and we baptize an average of two hundred per year, we should have brought in over seven thousand
Only after he finishes his college education can he be considered as having successfully completed his training
The Lord has shown us that when all the saints, old and young, men and women, are perfected, they can all build up the Body of Christ
Rather, every one of the perfected saints should participate in the work of the building up of the Body of Christ
When every one of the saints in the church can beget, nourish, teach, and build, God's eternal purpose is fulfilled
Corinthians 1426 says Whenever you come together each one has a psalm has a teaching has a revelation has a tongue has an interpretation
Verse 19 says to speak to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord
In the church meeting before we sing a hymn, it is not bad to first spend some time to speak the hymns to one another
When we exercise our spirit to speak the hymns, we express the content, atmosphere, and spirit of that message
For everyone to prophesy is to have a love feast in the Chinese style where everyone brings a dish and puts it on a long table
Ephesians 1:20-23 says that Christ resurrected from the dead and transmitted all the riches of ascension to those who believe in Him
We cannot find any place in the entire New Testament that the Lord charges only a minority of believers to preach the gospel
What we see is that the Lord commands all the believers when He says that 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth
In the matter of preaching the gospel, all the members of the Body of Christ with no exception should preach and should move
Not only should everyone preach the gospel, they should all participate in home meetings and group meetings as well
All the elders know that, on the one hand, they wish that there could be as many people as possible in their church
If five hundred people are baptized today, immediately we should have five hundred brothers and sisters come forward to claim one baby each
Although they may not be begotten through you, yet when you claim them for your own, it is as if you had begotten them
You will then lead them to the small group meetings so that they will get acquainted with those in the small group
A church where everyone is functioning will not only beget new ones, but it will also retain, sustain, and maintain them
They will also be able to have small group meetings to keep and perfect the new ones so that all will be built up together
As long as we are willing to practice these things and the more we do them, the more we will become capable and skillful
If you preach to no one today and will not save anyone even when you see them dying, you will have a difficult time facing the Lord
After this we should bring them to the Lord's Day morning meetings so that they would be cared for and perfected
The nature of the new way is to bring God into man to be mingled with man that man may become the Body of Christ
Not only can they win others to God, they can offer these same ones to God as offerings, that is, as food for God that He may be satisfied
He 'had his garment of camel's hair and a leather girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey'
John called for repentance, and group after group went out to him confessing their sins and were baptized by him in the River Jordan
God predestinated us before the foundation of the world that we would be chosen, in time be saved, and become offerings to God in Christ
The first page of the New Testament records, 'The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham'
The Lord Jesus bruised the serpent's head, and He is the One in whom all the families of the earth are blessed
Now we understand why John, born a priest, would not offer bulls and goats when he came out to fulfill his ministry
Beginning from the second century, through the third century and extending to the sixth century, the degradation worsened
570 the archbishop of Rome was recognized by all the churches as the pope, and the Roman Catholic church was officially established
Later, the private, independent churches, such as the Baptists and Methodists, developed from the state churches
By the eighteenth century, Brother Zinzendorf was raised up by the Lord to lead others to a recovery of the church life
The Lord enlightened us more and showed us that the degraded elements of Christianity had not been fully purged from us
Whenever we mention the meetings, there is the hope within us that as many believers as possible should be gathered together
What one sees exclusively in Christianity today are big gatherings with one speaking and all the rest listening
As early as 1948, Brother Watchman Nee said that this kind of gathering is like the Israelites following after the customs of the nations
After His resurrection the Lord said to the disciples, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
The Lord sent us to all the nations to preach the gospel to every man baptizing them into Himself and offering them up as sacrifices to God
We may think that since Brother Paul was the number one apostle, he was surely capable of preaching the gospel
Most believers are laymen who come only for the worship services, sitting in the pews without functioning at all
Every week they still go to the meeting hall to sweep the floor vacuum the carpets clean the windows arrange the chairs and serve as ushers
The Lord sent the seventy disciples to peoples' houses and told them that 'into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house
For this reason we all have to go and speak the gospel to others, thus fulfilling our duty as priests of the gospel
In Colossians 1:28 Paul said, 'Warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ'
In the end, through these different meetings we will be perfected step by step until we can finally be presented to God full-grown
As long as you are a saved person, having the Lord's life, you are a member of the Body of Christ and therefore a priest
From the context we see that God's will here is that Christ fulfill and replace all the Old Testament sacrifices
Rather, they offer the fallen sinners treasured and chosen by God before the foundation of the earth as sacrifices
For a church to be living, enlivened, and revived, there is no other way except for it to be a gospel-preaching church
We all have to go forth to bring the sinners to salvation that they would become offerings in Christ to be offered up to God
Although the saints are still willing to participate in the gospel work, they cannot preach nor do they have the opportunity to preach
The reason for this is that He had the burden to visit that detested, immoral, yet God-chosen woman living in Samaria
In the course of the conversation, the woman knew that the Lord Jesus was different, that He had the living water with Him
If we were to have answered that woman, we would have said, 'Confess your sins and then you can drink the living water'
If he turns to his spirit to worship God, he cannot rob the bank anymore, for his conscience will not allow him to do this
Everything of the new way is not a matter of place, form, method, or procedure, but a matter of reality in the spirit
Today although our God is the same as the one that the Jews worshipped there is a difference in age and there is also a difference in form
In the temple, there were rows and rows of priests serving God properly and according to the regulations of the Old Testament
The most difficult point we encounter when we preach the gospel to the Jews is that they still think that God is in the temple
Until today, after we lead people to salvation, they still have the natural concept of attending worship services
We must never bring this way of worship service into the home meeting, small group meeting, or Lord's Day morning meeting
If we have made an appointment with the brothers and sisters to have a home meeting at 7:30 tonight, then by 6:30 we should be ready
When we reach the saint's home and while we are ringing the bell, we can still sing, 'Since Jesus came into my heart'!
Paul said in Philippians 3:3 that the true worshippers are those who are in Christ, who serve by the Spirit of God
Those brothers and sisters who hear us, respond by singing, 'What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
According to my experience, to present our bodies is to present our time because our bodies are confined to our time'
A third one may say, 'According to my experience, to be transformed in the mind, we have to read the Lord's Word
Some brothers and sisters may then ask, 'After the body is presented and the mind is transformed, what happens next'?
Everyone acts according to the Spirit, moves according to the Spirit, and serves according to the Spirit of God
Every week throughout the fifty-two weeks of the year, we should set aside an evening for this kind of meeting
Not only do we bring the new ones to the small group meeting, but also, on the Lord's Day, we bring them to the church meeting
We will then help them along, first to prophesy in the small group meeting and then to prophesy in the Lord's Day morning meeting
All will be supplied, edified, and nourished, and the church as the Body of Christ will be built up through the prophesying by the saints
Our former way of meeting afforded no benefit to the Lord's economy and did not match the nature of God's economy
Every point of His ordained way matches the nature of God's New Testament economy, and meets the need of God's economy
Although resurrection and the Holy Spirit are closely related, in our subjective experience resurrection is even more closely tied to death
Our natural being with its natural strength and natural views must pass through death before we can enter into resurrection
Hymns 279 says First the blood and then the ointment cleansing then anointing comes if we pass not thru Golgotha neer to Pentecost well come
We also have seen that to take this way there is the need to pass through death and resurrection at every step
Also 2 Corinthians 1314 says The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all
By this, we see that grace is the consummated Spirit of the processed Triune God coming into us to be our everything
In the last verse he exhorted the brothers Wherefore my beloved brothers be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the Lord
Especially those brothers who are taking the lead in the churches should realize that such work cannot be accomplished by the natural man
Only by remaining in the grace of resurrection can we abound in the work of the Lord for the furtherance of the new way
We want to have a change in nature to preach the gospel and serve God according to God's desire and the pattern set forth in the Bible
We see from the Bible that the turn from the Old Testament to the New Testament occurred with John the Baptist
Matthew 34 says Now John himself had his garment of camels hair and a leather girdle about his loins and his food was locusts and wild honey
Paul said in Romans 15:16 that he was 'ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable'
Other than this, there is the offering of our praises, the offering of good works, and the offering of material goods
After this, we have to help them get into Romans 12, beseeching them to present themselves a living sacrifice to God
Paul said that we should be 'warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ'
In order for us to recover the universal priesthood of believers in the New Testament, everyone has to go preach the gospel and be a priest
She said, 'Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship'
The Lord answered her, saying, 'An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father
The Lord was revealing to her that the worship in the Old Testament was a matter of a physical place, but now the New Testament has come
We have received light from the Lord to see that the New Testament worship is not a matter of religious service
In the evening when we come to the meeting and even before we come to the meeting, we begin to sing and praise
When the brothers and sisters gradually arrive, some sooner and others later, they all begin to exercise their spirits
The reason that we have to change the system today is not merely to change a method and replace the big meetings with small meetings
Rather, it is because the big meetings with one speaker do not match the nature of God's New Testament economy
In other words, they have killed the universal priesthood of the New Testament and have caused a few to become the super-clergy
We need a thorough repentance, and we need to drop all the ways that are not according to God's New Testament economy
When God sovereignly works in a circumstance, He may gather many people together just as He did on the day of Pentecost
They should be priests of God's gospel directly, offering up the gospel sacrifices, which are the saved sinners
We also have to see that the requirements and demands of the New Testament can never be fulfilled by our natural man
Only by being in Christ and sharing in His death and resurrection can we possibly live a life of true consecration
Today the man in the old creation has to be changed into a man in the new creation, one that is in resurrection
In this way, we will truly be living in the Lord's resurrection, and there will be power from on high to supply us
We will be able to meet the demands of the New Testament and testify that we are those who have truly received abundant grace from the Lord
Although many have read the Bible and have identified these points, they carry them out using Gentile traditions and worldly methods
All that they have adopted are religious and organizational methods, which are not the organic work spoken of in the Bible
The environment for their preaching was absolutely prepared by the Holy Spirit, who gathered men from all corners of the earth
The Bible teaches us not only that we must preach the pure and holy word but also that the way we preach it must be holy
Although sinners may be saved, not much help will be rendered as far as the building up of the Body of Christ is concerned
Much damage will be done, because such a practice kills the priestly function among the saints in the matter of preaching the gospel
No doubt the gospel is preached and souls are saved, but absolutely no consideration is given to the Body of Christ
Even if each one would have saved only one person per year, in a year, twenty million people would have been saved
In ten years, two hundred million would have been saved, and in forty years, the number would have been staggering
Today the gospel is not sufficiently widespread, and everywhere we see evil, corruption, fornication, and other dark and shameful things
Such a meeting is like a family gathering, with spontaneous, mutual fellowship in which some may ask questions and others may all answer
Another may answer, according to what he knows, that when the Lord Jesus was crucified, we were crucified with Him
In the small group meeting, when all speak back and forth, in a year's time everyone will have learned, and everyone will be able to speak
In the end, there will be an 'academic tradition' developed among us, and it can be passed on to the next generation
For this reason, we need to be familiar with the words of the Bible and should soak ourselves in the Lord's word
After that, you still have to perfect them for the building up of the Body of Christ, until they arrive at a full-grown man
The term 'priest of the gospel' has been in the Chinese Bible for over a hundred years; it was not noticed by the students of the Bible
As early as the first century when Paul wrote the book of Hebrews, especially in chapters nine and ten, he was expounding Leviticus already
Being born a priest of the Old Testament, he should have lived in the priestly home, walking in and out of the temple
He rejected the priestly family, turned away from the temple, and would not even slaughter the bulls and goats for offerings
He told those who came out to him to be baptized, 'Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath'?
When John turned to become the first gospel priest of God in the New Testament, he did not offer bulls and goats for sacrifices
He desired that all the saints would be perfected and be able to do the work of the ministry, for the building up of the Body of Christ
He warned and taught in all wisdom until these believers became mature in Christ; then he presented them full-grown
The second step, which is to perfect people by the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings, is still less than ideal
He brought the gospel with him and visited the sinners by knocking on their doors, pleading with them to receive the gospel
By chapter twelve of Romans, not only do the new ones have home meetings, they are being perfected in the small group meetings as well
We have to struggle according to the operation of Christ's power within until the saints can be presented full-grown in Christ to God
We must arrive at this point before the duty of the New Testament priest of the gospel can be considered as completed
In this way, what you have done in others in the way of perfecting is fully duplicated by them in more new ones
Whether you have been trained or not, you are a priest of the gospel, and you have to preach the gospel to others
The reason you cannot preach is that you do not preach, and the reason you are afraid to preach is also that you do not preach
You have to knock on every one of the hundreds of thousands of doors in Taipei to send the precious gospel to people
He traveled by boat across the seas, taking long journeys far from home and paying the price to send the gospel out
If we had been laboring in the way that Paul did, struggling and striving to perfect the saints, Taiwan would have been evangelized long ago
We have to ask the Lord to grant us the grace that we would be able to bear at least one fruit per year to offer to God
Although they can be considered a part of Protestantism they do not belong to the big denominations of Protestantism
Christianity employs a few clergymen who have studied theology and have learned some biblical truth to serve God
We said that we are all New Testament priests of the gospel and that as priests we should offer up gospel sacrifices
Paul said that as a priest of the gospel, he offered up the nations to God as offerings, which are the sinners saved through his gospel
On the other hand, according to the Bible, God chose Paul to be the pattern to all those who believe in the Lord Jesus
Whenever we talked about preaching the gospel, we considered that a certain brother would stand on the platform to release a message
As to the other brothers and sisters, their job was just to help that one to lead the songs, pray, and read the Scripture
Some would also help in cleaning the hall, arranging the chairs, inviting the friends, and preparing the love feasts
God wants every saved person to be a living member of the Body of Christ, but man's way is to invite big evangelists to conduct campaigns
Paul said that he was not just a nursing mother to nourish and cherish, but a father to entreat, console, and teach
The old system makes a person lazy, but in the Lord's recovery everyone has to be diligent to strive and pursue seriously
After preaching the gospel to save sinners and offering them up to God as sacrifices, there are still three big steps to be taken
You should help them use their spirit pray with their spirit and call on the name of the Lord from their spirit to take in the Lords riches
It is very difficult to get the sisters to speak in the meetings; therefore, we have to encourage them to open up
In Acts 20 Paul said I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable and to teach you publicly and from house to house
Whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ'
Not only should they teach in the meetings, but they have to go to the homes of the saints and teach them mouth to mouth and one by one
The small group has the ability to perfect people, helping them to know the truth, to grow in life, and to function organically
When the saints are perfected to grow into maturity, being edified in truth and having the experience in life, they are enabled to prophesy
Sooner or later the Lord will have to recover the new way, for this is the word spoken by the Lord in the Bible
Last summer, the Lord showed us that the Body of Christ is an organism and it is produced by the processed Triune God
If we read Ephesians chapter one carefully, we will see that from the processed Triune God the Body of Christ is produced
Verse 22 says, 'And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church'
After the church is produced, verse 23 continues on to say that the church 'is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all'
At the same time, the Lord has shown us that everyone has to prophesy in the church meeting that all the saints may learn and be encouraged
One of these chapters mentions the building up of the Body of Christ; the other chapter mentions the building up of the church
You must personally go out to visit people, to preach the gospel to bring them to salvation, and to bring these sinners as offerings to God
You yourselves must go and perfect and teach others so that all the brothers and sisters will be able to do the same
To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into others so that they will be supplied
Not only do you have to learn, but you must also help others to see what is the proper prophesying that will build up the church
The way of mutual teaching and mutual asking and answering in the small group meeting can also stir up the prophesying ability within you
According to the Bible, the Christian meeting where the Word is released is the meeting of 1 Corinthians 14 in which every member prophesies
There are times when after an hour of meeting, the content of the prophesying is still quite weak and lifeless
You have to grasp the opportunity to speak a five-minute word that is filled with rich content based on the material used
Paul exhorted the saints in Romans 12:11 to be 'not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave'
We thank You especially for giving us this day, that all the elders, co-workers, and trainees on this whole island can be gathered together
Lord, speak to us and present to us clearly the way that You want to take and the recovery You want to accomplish in us
Lord, this is the straight and proper path which we have consecrated ourselves to take, to turn to, to follow, and to walk in forever
Whatever You have not recovered, whatever is left out, be it great or small, deep or high, may You recover it point by point among us
Not only may it be recovered today, but may it be recovered until You come, even until eternity, that You would gain what You are after
It has been written down clearly by Your servant, the Apostle Paul, and now every one of us can see, read, and understand
We did not have any experience concerning this new way, and we were also lacking in a clear vision concerning it
At the same time, we pointed out a series of matters related to how Christians should meet, preach the gospel, serve God, and work for God
From the time the Apostles passed away until today, Christians during the past nineteen centuries have been debating these four things
Because these four matters were very much related to the practical move and work of Christians, the debates became more and more heated
We know that as far as the Lord is concerned, everything in the universe was complete as soon as it was created
When the aged John wrote Revelation, the last book of the New Testament, he wrote seven epistles to the seven local churches
He inherited the items of recovery from the past and culminated all the Lord's recoveries during the preceding sixteen centuries
That is why the Lord told the church in Sardis, 'I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead
In the eighteenth century Brother Zinzendorf from the southern part of Germany began the recovery of the church life and the church practice
In the beginning of the twentieth century, the Lord came to the Far East and raised up a young Chinese brother by the name of Watchman Nee
He turned from the line of Antioch, which was a 'rethinking,' to the line of Jerusalem, which was a 're-rethinking'
The first vision that the Lord has shown us is that the church is an organism produced by the processed Triune God
It does not come about by the Triune God through creation neither does it come about by the Triune God calling it into being all of a sudden
Verses 13 through 14 speak of the Spirit's sealing and pledging for our foretaste of the rich inheritance of God
The church is an organism as the mingling of God and man produced through the processed Triune God in His divine Trinity
If during these forty years, he would have perfected others to do the work of evangelism, then many would have been perfected
Everyone takes the convenient and avoids the difficult, choosing the benefits of the readily accessible while neglecting the long-term view
After the Lord went to the cross, He continued to train the disciples by His death and resurrection and by His invisible presence
Colossians 1:28 also shows us that Paul warned and taught every man in all wisdom, so as to present every man full-grown in Christ
In the small group meetings, there is the mutual teaching and learning of the truth and the pursuit of the growth in life
Whenever anyone speaks the word of God, based on the experience of life and the knowledge of the truth, the result is prophesying
The turn of the priesthood from the Old Testament to the New Testament happened in John the Baptist who was born a priest
According to the custom, he should have worn the priestly garment, eaten the priestly food, and grown up in the temple
Notwithstanding, he was the first one to turn from the Old Testament priesthood to the New Testament priesthood
Paul became a spiritual priest, a gospel priest, offering up to God spiritual sacrifices, which are the sinners saved through his preaching
If a New Testament believer has not preached the gospel and does not lead sinners to be saved, he is a priest who fails in his function
We have to see that the gospel meeting in Christianity today with one or two preaching, though right in goal, is wrong in means
The revelation is open to us today in order to show us that the preaching of the gospel should arrive at Gods goal and complete Gods economy
The emphasis in the service of all the gifts is not on the works, but on their perfecting of the saints to do the works
We will then be a mature person in the eyes of God waiting for the Lord to come back at which time our body will be fully saturated as well
The above words are the light and revelation which we have accumulated through our sixty years of studying the Bible and the spiritual books
Today, the basis of our meeting, gospel preaching, service, and work for the Lord is regeneration, by which we have the divine life
In the same way, a broken arm can be joined together again through the circulation of blood, which is the fellowship of life
God's plan is to make this kind of people the organic members of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God
Every one of us has to preach the gospel and lead the sinners to salvation, bringing them to God and offering them up as sacrifices
It is not enough for a child just to be nourished and cared for; there is still the need of teaching and perfecting
We have managed our meeting hall well; but our gospel preaching, home meetings, small group meetings, and prophesying are not doing as well
We did this because the center of our gospel preaching is God working Himself into man to be his life and everything
In this way, the work of each saint being perfected to perfect others unto the work of the building up of the Body of Christ is replaced
