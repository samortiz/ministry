   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPEAKING TO THE ROCK TO DRINK THE LIVING WATER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Numbers 20:1-13 tells us that after a certain time, the children of Israel came back again to Massah or Meribah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This third occasion of the children of Israel's drinking is a repetition of the second one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Massah means temptation and Meribah means chiding or strife.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was at Massah or Meribah that the children of Israel tempted and strove with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By that time the children of Israel were circling in their travels.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were wandering in the wilderness and came back again to the same spot.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If they had not wandered but had gone on, they would never have had a repetition of their experience at Massah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because they were wandering and would not go on, they came back again to the place of tempting the Lord and striving with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a local church would not go on but would wander, sooner or later that church will have a repetition of this poor experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The children of Israel chided with Moses again, and this time they really offended Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moses went to the Lord, and the Lord told Moses to speak to the rock so that the water could flow out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was no need for Moses to smite the rock because it had already been smitten and cleft.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Moses was angry with the people of Israel and called them rebels Num 20:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This incident shows us that we need to be careful regarding how we treat and speak about the Lord's children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if they are poor, we should not be so angry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if they are poor, it is safe to say that they are very good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are wise, you will not go to the parents of a certain boy or girl to say something bad about them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regardless of how poor or how bad their children are, do not go to their parents to say something bad about them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is best to tell the parents something good about their children.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The book of Numbers tells us the story of Balak hiring Balaam to curse the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time the children of Israel were very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Balak thought it was the right time for him to hire Balaam to curse them because of the poor situation among them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All Balaam could do, however, was bless the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said that the Lord saw no iniquity or perverseness among the children of Israel 23:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Balaam's prophecy surprised Balak, so he took Balaam to another place to curse the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Perhaps if Balaam would see the children of Israel from another angle, from another direction, he would see their real situation and curse them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually Balaam said, "How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>24:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All Balaam could say about the children of Israel was something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not say that the church in your locality is so poor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you say this, you will lose something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moses lost the entry into the good land due to his mistake in his anger at Meribah.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because he was angry, he did something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord did not tell him to smite the rock again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord told him to go and speak to the rock, which had already been smitten.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When people get angry, it is always easy for them to do something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you get angry, you must learn the secret of running away from the situation that makes you angry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not say anything or do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just run away from the situation and keep yourself away until your anger is over.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then you may come back to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even Moses, who was an old, experienced, humble, meek, and patient man, did something wrong in his anger.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is very hard to pass the test of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the local churches the leading brothers are always tested by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They may have done many good things for the saints and to the saints, but the saints may forget these things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They may chide with the leading ones, fight against them, and say something poor about them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That may cause the leading brothers to be angry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we need to be careful and not get angry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not call the saints rebels but always speak well concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you say that the brothers are good and the sisters are nice, you will gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although Moses did something wrong by striking the rock, the Lord was merciful and the water still came out of the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The fact that the rock gave forth water even under the wrongdoing of Moses proves how merciful the Lord is.</S>
