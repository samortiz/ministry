   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Knowing and Exercising the Human Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even before 1924 Brother Nee saw the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later we had to be helped to know the human spirit and to exercise, to use, the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were taught to turn to our spirit and to stay in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our human spirit can be likened to an electrical switch.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to apply the electricity in a building, we have to turn on the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our spirit is the switch to apply all the things of Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>35.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Actual Building Up</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Nee stressed that we all need an actual building up in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not just have a doctrinal talk about the building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Nee said that we had to consider who we have actually been built up with.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said, "You may be a good speaker who can give many messages on building up, but with whom have you ever been built up?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need the actual building up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the war, every time Brother Nee spoke, he was always either on the breaking of the outer man or on the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Brother Nee asked us who we were built up with, this put us all on the spot.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not many could give an adequate answer because we were all exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although Brother Nee was very nice and gentle, he was also very frank and strict with his trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes he adjusted me in a bold way, and I received much help from his training.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>36.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ, the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Corinthians 15:45b tells us that the last Adam, Christ, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I cannot tell you how much life this one point has brought to the church!</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After 1948, we began to see how to eat and drink the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In other words, we began to see that we need to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This also includes the revelation of Christ as the tree of life, good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>38.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Pray-reading</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 1966 we were brought into the practice of pray-reading the Word of God.</S>
