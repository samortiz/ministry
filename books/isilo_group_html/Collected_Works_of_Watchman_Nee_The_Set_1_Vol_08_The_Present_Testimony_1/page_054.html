Paul not only wrote Philippians; he also wrote the Epistles of Ephesians and Colossians as well. Each of these three Epistles has its own emphasis. Ephesians talks about the church as the Body of Christ. Colossians talks about how Christ is in the church. Philippians does not talk about such profound doctrines as those contained in Ephesians and Colossians; rather, it emphasizes one thing: freedom from disputes. Philippians 4:2 says, "I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord." These two serving sisters did not get along peacefully. For this reason Paul specifically beseeched them.</P><P>Philippians places special emphasis on the matters of humility, peace, and love for one another. We may say that Philippians is a footnote to 1 Corinthians 13. Paul beseeched the Philippians to consider one another in lowliness of mind more excellent than themselves, not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also. After this he mentions how the Lord emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men, humbling Himself, becoming obedient even unto the death of a cross. Paul told them that this was the mind of Christ; therefore, he beseeched them to let the mind that was in Christ Jesus also be in them. However, there was a difficulty here. Although there was a willingness, there was not an ability. Listening is one thing, but doing is another. The apostle Paul talked about how the Lord emptied Himself, humbled Himself, and became obedient even unto the death of a cross. With such a high standard, the two sisters undoubtedly thought that it was impossible for them to attain to this standard. Therefore, Paul continued and told them how it could be done in verses 12 through 18 in chapter two.</P><P>Verse 12 says, "So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling." So then refers to the previous context. My beloved was used by Paul whenever he was giving a very important word. Since he used this designation, what follows must be very important. "Even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence." What is the meaning of this word? Paul said that in the past when he preached the gospel to them, they always obeyed. Since things had gone wrong, they should obey even more. They obeyed him when he preached the gospel there, when he was an example there, and when they had contact with him; therefore, they should still obey him. These few words contain three points. First, they obeyed Paul when he was there because he had contact with them. Second, in Paul's absence, they should obey even more because they were entrusted more to God. Third, they needed to obey so that they could work out their own salvation with fear and trembling.</P><P>"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling" (2:12b). We should read this verse several times. Fear is toward God, trembling is toward ourselves. On one hand, we should fear God; on the other hand, we should tremble toward ourselves. Temptation is strong; therefore, we tremble. God is great, therefore, we fear. How can salvation be worked out? We thank God that He has a way; salvation can be worked out.</P><P>The Bible has divided the matter of salvation into three stages. First, in the past, God delivered us from the punishment of hell. Second, in the present, God saves us from the power of sin. Third, in the future, God will cause us to enter into the kingdom to be co-kings with Christ. Let me give a few examples:</P><P>Second Timothy 1:9 says, "Who has saved us." This occurred in the past, and every believer has received this salvation.</P><P>Hebrews 7:25 says, "Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him." This is the present salvation, and it can be received today.</P><P>Hebrews 9:28 says, "So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation." This is the salvation in the future.</P><P>The Bible clearly mentions three kinds of salvation, one in the past, one in the present, and one in the future. Some Christians may have received the past salvation, but they may not have received the present and the future salvation. Some Christians have received the past salvation as well as the present salvation, and they are going to receive the future salvation. It is possible to be delivered from the punishment of hell and yet sin daily. It is possible to be delivered from the punishment of hell, but this does not necessarily mean that one will be a king in the future. I will mention three more verses in the Bible to prove these three stages of salvation.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 08: The Present Testimony (1) &nbsp; pg 54</div><br></body></html>
