   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Romans 7 explains this matter very clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us look at this chapter, beginning with verses 7 and 8, "What then shall we say?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is the law sin?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I did not know sin except through the law; for neither did I know coveting, except the law had said, 'You shall not covet.'</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind; for without the law sin is dead."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without the law, I do not feel that coveting is sin, even though there is coveting within me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, coveting within me is dead; that is, I am not conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, after the law comes, I resolve not to covet anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But I still covet, and the sin is made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 9 says, "And I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Friends, remember that God gave you the law for one reason only: to show you that you have always been full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because you did not see your own sin, you acted proudly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The law came to try you out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may say that you do not covet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However if you just try not to covet, what will be the eventual result?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more you try, the weaker you become and the more covetous you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You purpose not to covet, but the moment you purpose this way, you find yourself coveting everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You covet today, and you will covet tomorrow; you covet everywhere you turn.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now sin is alive, the law is alive, and you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Originally sin was dead and you were fine, but now that the law has come you cannot avoid coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more you try not to covet, the more covetous you become.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The problem is that man's being is fleshly, and because man is fleshly, his will is weak, his conduct is rebellious, and his desires are filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 10 says, "And the commandment, which was unto life, this very commandment was found to me to be unto death."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If man can truly keep the law, he will live.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I cannot keep it; hence, I die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 11 says, "For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the law had not told me that I should not do this or that, sin would go easy on me and would not be that active in me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But ever since the law came and told me that I should not covet, sin through the commandment has tempted me and put this matter of coveting in my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law tells me that I should not covet, and I purpose not to covet; but instead of not coveting, I covet even more.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For a period of time I felt that I had been lying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I did not lie deliberately, but I would sometimes unintentionally say too much about something or too little about something else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I realized this, I resolved that from then on with me yes would be yes and no would be no. Regardless of whom I spoke to, I resolved to speak accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before I resolved this, I really did not lie that much, but after I made the decision, it became so easy for me to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was actually getting worse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The following Sunday I sent a note saying that I would not give a message that day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I was asked for a reason, I said, "I have found out that my speaking is full of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is quite serious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am afraid that even my message will be all lies."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I did not pay attention to lying, lying seemed dead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, that does not mean that I did not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, it was not until I started paying attention to lying, not until I was enlightened by the law to deal with my lies, that I felt that all my words were lies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It seems that lies were standing right next to me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, I have found that originally the lies were dead, but now the lies have been made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everywhere I turn, the lies are there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sin has killed me through the law and I become helpless.</S>
