   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONENESS IN THE DIVINE GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 22 the Lord said that the glory which the Father had given Him He had given to His believers "that they may be one even as We are one."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Glory is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This expression has been given to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Father has given the Son the glory to express Him in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now this glory has been given to us by the Son so that we may be one even as the Father and the Son are one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This oneness is the oneness in the divine glory for the corporate expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>PERFECTED INTO ONE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 23 the Lord continues, "I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see the mingling of the processed God with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The words I, them, and You refer respectively to Christ, the believers, and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Son is in the believers, and the Father is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the mingling of the Triune God with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result of such a mingling, we may be perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps you are wondering what it means to be perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the day we believed in Christ, we came into this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we still have problems with our natural man, our natural constitution, and our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the more we experience Christ as the life-giving Spirit, the more all these natural elements are reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As they are reduced through our experience of the Triune God, we are perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all need to be impressed with the fact that the oneness revealed in the Bible is not a matter of adding the believers together to form a harmonious unit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a concept of oneness is natural and superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once again we say that oneness is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Having seen this oneness as it is unfolded in John 17 and Ephesians 4, let us now consider Psalm 133.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>TWO ASPECTS OF ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This psalm is so profound that it is difficult to speak about it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 1 says, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in oneness!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Notice that the psalmist uses two adjectives to describe brethren dwelling together in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He says that this is good and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason two adjectives are used is that in the following verses the dwelling together in oneness is likened to two things: to the precious ointment on the head of Aaron and to the dew of Hermon on the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These two adjectives point to two aspects of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The oneness is good and pleasant: good as the precious ointment and pleasant as the descending dew.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of these aspects, the first Aaron is a person, and the second Zion is a place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Have you ever seen that the church has these two aspects?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, the church is a person; on the other hand, the church is a place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a person, the church includes the Head with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a place, the church is the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Elsewhere in the Bible we see that the church is the Bride, the new man, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These, however, are aspects of the church as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually the church has just two main aspects: the aspect of a person and the aspect of a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Related to these two aspects of the church are the ointment and the dew.</S>
