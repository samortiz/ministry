<p>For decades I have been studying the Lord&rsquo;s way to preach the gospel. While reconsidering this matter, I discovered new light that I had not seen previously. Immediately after man&rsquo;s fall, God came to visit man. After Adam and Eve fell, they sewed fig leaves together to cover their shame, their sin (Gen. 3:7). Then God came to them and called Adam, saying, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; (v. 9). The first time that the gospel was preached in the universe, God came to where the sinner was; the sinner did not go to where God was. Of course, God needs sinners to approach Him, but He first approaches a sinner so that the sinner can approach Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Coming among Men through Incarnation</h2>
<p>Four thousand years later the God who personally visited fallen Adam not only visited mankind but even entered into humanity by putting on the flesh and becoming a man in order to dwell among men for thirty-three and a half years (John 1:1, 14). The Bible says, &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:15), and &ldquo;the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost&rdquo; (Luke 19:10). The first step in His coming is to seek those who are lost, and the second step is to save them. Every unbeliever is lost, and the Lord wants to come to where they are to seek and save them. This may be likened to a shepherd seeking the sheep that have strayed off and bringing them back to the flock.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Saving People by Going Forth<br />
and Preaching the Gospel to Them</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was qualified to carry out His ministry when He was thirty years old; hence, He went forth to work. The main thing that He did was to proclaim the gospel by going to people instead of asking them to come to Him. He went time after time. Luke 19 and John 4 are two examples of the Lord going forth to preach the gospel. In Luke 19 the Lord Jesus was passing through Jericho, and Zaccheus wanted to see Him. Due to his small stature, Zaccheus climbed up in a sycamore tree, and when the Lord Jesus noticed Zaccheus, He said to him, &ldquo;Today I must stay in your house&rdquo; (v. 5). The Lord did not consider it enough to see Zaccheus; He wanted to visit Zaccheus in his house. In John 4 the Lord Jesus had to pass through Samaria and went to Sychar, where He waited by Jacob&rsquo;s well for an immoral woman to come draw water from the well. The Lord Jesus used this opportunity to preach the gospel to her. This shows that the Lord&rsquo;s way was not to invite people to come and listen to the gospel but to go to where people were and preach the gospel to them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Disciples Doing What the Lord Did</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was not the only one with this practice; He also asked the disciples to do the same. He first sent out twelve disciples to go two by two (Matt. 10:1-4; Mark 6:7), and He also sent out seventy disciples two by two (Luke 10:1). When He sent them, He said, &ldquo;Go; behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves...Into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house. And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you&rdquo; (vv. 3, 5-6). The Lord sent the disciples as lambs in the midst of wolves, and as they went from house to house, they would eventually find the sons of peace. The disciples were sheep in the midst of wolves, but there were sons of peace among the wolves. When we go to knock on doors, people may slam the door in rejection or speak evilly of us. But one of the houses we visit will be the home of sons of peace, and we may gain three persons there. This may seem unbelievable, but it is our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLE IN ACTS</h2>
<p>In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus preached the gospel by going to visit people. In Acts the apostles had the same practice. Paul did not practice what most preachers do today. He did not go to a locality and build a place for holding church meetings and then invite people to come and listen to his sermons. In Philippi he went to a place of prayer outside the gate by the river in order to visit the seekers of God who had gathered to pray (16:13). Building a place for meetings and inviting people to hear the gospel is troublesome, requires a great deal of preparation, and involves a large number of people. In contrast, it was very convenient for Paul to find people by the river. This can be compared to our going out to knock on doors. If we move to a new place, we can go out the next day to knock on doors and baptize people. This is the example that Paul left for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TESTIMONIES</h2>
<p>An elder in a church went to the training in Taipei and learned how to go door-knocking, and he became &ldquo;addicted.&rdquo; Now he eagerly waits for the evening so that he can go out to knock on doors and baptize people. He has even considered moving to Taipei because it is easier to knock on doors there. Sometimes after knocking on one door, you can baptize two people, and after knocking on another door, you can baptize three more people. Some saints were able to baptize twenty people in one night. The saints have also encountered negative situations, such as being rejected, reviled, and spurned and having the door slammed in their face. However, the Lord did not say that He sent the disciples out in the midst of gentlemen; He sends us into the midst of wolves (Luke 10:3). Hence, we should not be bothered, because the Lord has warned us beforehand.</p>
<p>Christianity does not seek out the sons of peace. Formerly, we made this same serious mistake: we asked people to come to us for the gospel; we did not go to them. We built large meeting halls, invited someone who was eloquent, burdened, and competent to speak the gospel, and invited people to come and listen. We exerted much effort to invite guests by putting advertisements in newspapers and distributing tracts and invitations everywhere. In the early days there were not many cars in Taiwan, so we would hire pedicabs to bring people to the gospel meeting. When cars became popular, we hired taxis to bring people to the meeting. Those who were willing to come seemed to be doing us a great honor. Sometimes we also prepared a love feast and invited over a hundred people, but only ten would show up, and perhaps one or two would be baptized.</p>
<p>When we began the work in Taiwan, we told the saints to bring people to the gospel meetings. Sometimes six or seven hundred people were brought to the meetings, and up to two hundred would be baptized. We were even able to baptize over seven hundred people in one meeting. We brought forth many children, but in the end they &ldquo;died&rdquo; prematurely. Our mistake was that we were asking people to come to us, but the Bible says that we must go. It is difficult to invite people to come, but it is very easy to go to people where they are. This is confirmed by our experience.</p>
<p>In America there are restaurants that take orders by phone and then deliver the food to the customers. I was once in a place that had few hospitals. People there did not need to find a nurse or a doctor if they needed an injection. There was a person who rode a bicycle with the sign Injections in Your Home; he was willing to go to a home to take care of people. Based on this example, I would ask, &ldquo;Should we not be willing to go to people&rsquo;s homes to preach the gospel?&rdquo; I have discovered that the proper way to preach the gospel is to go to people&rsquo;s homes. John 4:35 says that the fields &ldquo;are already white for harvest,&rdquo; and Matthew 9:37 says, &ldquo;The harvest is great, but the workers few.&rdquo; There is harvest everywhere that is ready to be reaped, but we are still distributing invitations that ask the harvest to come to us. Eventually, no one will come. We need to go and reap the harvest.</p>
<p>I have good news to announce to you. From the second half of 1986 to the end of 1987, we held three terms of full-time training in Taipei. The trainees were required to go out door-knocking and to visit people, and they went &ldquo;from house to house&rdquo; (Acts 5:42). They knocked on approximately seven hundred fifty thousand doors and baptized forty thousand people. Through this we gained experience and learned that door-knocking works and is very effective. We have also learned that we should not baptize too many people in one evening, because we cannot take care of them. This can be compared to giving birth to too many children and not being able to give them proper care. I believe that only a few of those whom we baptized are not clear about their salvation. Without proper care some might lose contact with us after a few years, and they will stop meeting. However, they will not forget that they called on the Lord&rsquo;s name, were baptized, and are believers in the Lord. Once a person is saved, he is saved eternally.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Proper Way for Believers to Meet and to Serve &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
