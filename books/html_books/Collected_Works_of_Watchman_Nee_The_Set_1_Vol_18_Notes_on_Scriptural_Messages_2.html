The Lord Jesus manifested Himself first to Mary the Magdalene. The Lord was eager to manifest Himself to Peter because Peter was in the midst of weakness, but He was more eager to manifest Himself to Mary the Magdalene. He was eager to manifest Himself to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus because they were heading in the wrong direction, but He was more eager to manifest Himself to Mary the Magdalene. He was eager to manifest Himself to John because John was the one He loved, but He was more eager to manifest Himself to Mary the Magdalene. He was eager to manifest Himself to Thomas because Thomas did not believe His resurrection, but He was more eager to manifest Himself to Mary the Magdalene. There were other disciples to whom the Lord was eager to manifest Himself. But the Lord did not manifest Himself to them first. He manifested Himself first to Mary the Magdalene. Why did the Lord manifest Himself first to Mary the Magdalene before Peter, John, Thomas, the other disciples, and the people?</P><P>Mary the Magdalene was the last one to leave the site of the cross; she was the first one to come to the tomb. Besides Mary the Magdalene, many others were saved. Besides Mary the Magdalene, many others had demons cast out. But only Mary the Magdalene came early in the morning to the tomb to seek the Lord. There is no doubt that she did not understand many things. Some may even have thought that she did not have a good mind; but she received the best portion, a portion which we may not have. Her better portion was her love for the Lord. Every Christian should desire and pursue after this.</P><P>John 1:29 says that when John the Baptist saw Jesus coming to him, he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" John the Baptist said this when he saw the Lord for the first time. In verse 36 John saw the Lord Jesus again and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" John did not say "who takes away the sin of the world" the second time. Had he forgotten? No. This is the experience of a saved person. When a person sees the Lord for the first time, he thinks about himself as well as the Lord. He thinks of the Lord as the Lamb of God who takes away his sin. When he sees the Lord for the second time, he forgets about himself and sees only the Lord. The first time, he thanks Him because of the grace He gives. The second time, he draws near to Him because of Himself. Our baptism is our union with the Lord, while the breaking of bread is our remembrance of the Lord Himself. First, we become the Lord's believers; then we become His lovers. First, we believe in the Lord's work; then we are drawn to the Lord's person. Many of us only know the preciousness of the Lord's work, but not the preciousness of the Lord Himself. We only know the grace we have received, but not the loveliness of the Lord. The difference between Mary the Magdalene and the others was that she not only appreciated salvation, she also treasured the Savior.</P><P>Oh, many people had their demons cast out by the Lord, but only Mary the Magdalene sought after the Lord. Although other women came to seek the Lord, the very first one to come to the tomb was Mary the Magdalene. On the first day of the week, early in the morning while it was still dark, she came to the tomb. She did not care for anything; she came to seek the Lord. A brother once said something very good about this. He said, "Since the Lord Jesus died, the world in the eyes of Mary had become nothing but a void!" The whole world could not draw Mary's heart, because One had already taken her heart away. Mary's heart was a heart completely occupied by the Lord. Mary's heart was a heart captured by the Lord. Oh, the heart of Mary the Magdalene was seized by the Lord!</P><P>When Mary came to the tomb, what did she see? What did she do? She thought, "My beloved Lord has died. Today all I want is to have a look at His body." However, the body was gone! She could only run to Peter and John and say to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him." Peter and the other disciple, John, then went to the tomb. They ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the tomb. Stooping down and looking in, he saw the linen cloths; yet he did not go in. Simon Peter followed him, went into the tomb, and saw the linen cloths; the handkerchief that had been over His head was not lying with the linen cloths, but was folded up in one place apart. Then the other disciple went in, saw, and believed. After the two disciples saw this, what did they do? The Bible says, "The disciples therefore went away again to their own home." They still had a home in the world which they regarded as their best. They still had a home. Although they found that the Lord was not there, they did not feel anything. They felt that going back to their own home was the most important thing to do. Besides the Lord, they still had a place to go.</P><P>What did Mary do? "But Mary stood outside at the tomb weeping." She had nowhere to go! She could not go away! How profound is the word "but!" Mary thought in her heart, "You have a home to which you can go, but I cannot because the Lord is not here. You think that the disappearance of the Lord is not important, but I cannot feel the same. Who has taken Him away? How can I leave?" She stood outside of the tomb weeping. In her eyes the world had become a void! The Lord was not there. What else could she do? She could not do anything but stand outside of the tomb and weep. Oh, Mary's heart was a widow's heart! The disciples who followed after the Lord went away. The disciples who had some knowledge went away. John, who loved the Lord, went away. Peter, who was so bold, went away. But Mary, a simple woman out of whom the Lord had driven seven demons, was caught by the Lord. She had no peace. She had no comfort. She could not go away. The Lord was not there; everything was over. Her heart was missing something. Her heart was empty; therefore, she could only weep.</P><P>"Then as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb and beheld two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. And they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him." When Mary saw the angels, she was neither surprised nor frightened. Why? Her heart was completely set on the matter of "they have taken away my Lord." She paid no attention to other things. Her heart was so single in thinking about the Lord that even the manifestation of the angels could not attract her attention. She did not care for what the angels were doing. Her heart was only for her Lord. Even the angels could not move her heart.</P><P>Perhaps someone may think, "John loved the Lord so much. If I could only follow after him, it would be wonderful. Peter was dealt with by the Lord very much. If I could listen to his instruction once, it would be wonderful." But Mary's heart was not concerned with these things. Although Peter and John were present, it was not enough. Her heart was a widow's heart! You may think that she should have been glad to have angels talking to her. But Mary did not feel anything. While others may think that the angels were special and attractive in such white and shining clothes, Mary thought only about her Lord being taken away. The angels could not fill up her empty heart, and she could only weep. She thought, "The Lord is gone; I cannot be satisfied anymore! Although Peter and John are here, the Lord is gone; I cannot be satisfied! Although angels are here, the Lord is not here; I cannot be satisfied."</P><P>The angels asked her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said, "They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him." She thought that even though the Lord was dead, His body was still precious. It did not occur to her that the Lord had resurrected. In Matthew the Lord told the disciples four times that He would be raised on the third day after He died (Matt. 16:21; 17:23; 20:19; 26:32). But she did not know anything about this. On that day she was without hope. It would be good enough if she could only have the body of the Lord. Although she was so ignorant, her singleness in wanting the Lord caused the Lord to reveal Himself to her.</P><P>The reason the Lord manifested Himself to Mary was to satisfy a heart that was hungry and thirsty for Him. Peter and John went back to their own home. The Lord did not go to find them. But here was a heart which was single and wholly for Him. Therefore, the Lord needed to look for her. Brothers and sisters, it will not matter much if we have less knowledge. What matters is that we have a heart which can urge the Lord to look for us. This is the most precious thing.</P><P>"When she said these things, she turned backward and beheld Jesus standing there, yet she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that He was the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away." She saw the Lord Jesus, but she thought He was the gardener. The Lord asked her whom she sought. She said, "If you have carried Him away." She forgot to say she was seeking the Lord. She was seeking Jesus the Nazarene. She only said, "Him." In Mary's eyes, there was only one "Him" in the world. In Mary's heart, she supposed everyone knew who "Him" was. Mary supposed everyone should recognize "Him." Mary did not care for anyone but only one "Him." This was Mary's heart.</P><P>In Song of Solomon 1:2, the beginning of the first sentence says, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth." These were the words of the Shulamite who longed for Solomon. The One Mary's heart longed for was "Him." What she said with her mouth was also "Him." In her heart and mouth there was only "Him." If there was "Him," she had enough. We should have enough to have only "Him" in our heart also. It does not matter if we lack spiritual knowledge. It is enough to have "Him." It is not necessary to have more knowledge; what we need is a heart that is wholly for Him.</P><P>"If you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away." What kind of person was Mary? She was a woman. We do not know whether she was weak or physically strong, but we know that her heart wanted to take Him. She did not consider if her strength was great enough. She did not consider how far the way was. She only considered that she wanted to take Him. Love does not know the meaning of "difficulty." The most wonderful thing in the world is that the presence of love makes everything easy. She did not care for anything. She only wanted to know where others had taken Him. She would then go to take Him. This was Mary's heart.</P><P>Under this circumstance, the Lord had to reveal Himself to her. The Lord could not let her weep anymore. The Lord could not first go to find Peter and John, nor could He go to find the two disciples who were on the way to Emmaus. He also could not go to find Thomas. The Lord had to first fill up a heart that was hungry and thirsty for Him. The Lord had to manifest Himself first to Mary.</P><P>How did the Lord manifest Himself to her? "Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which means Teacher)." Have we heard the Lord speak "Mary" with such a voice? At the time of your prayer, in your chamber, if you hear this voice say, "Mary," it will be enough. When the Lord said, "Mary," Mary recognized Him. This was a revelation. Once the Lord speaks, it is enough. When the shepherd calls his sheep, the eyes of his sheep are opened. Once Mary heard the voice of the Lord, she knew that it was not the gardener but the Master. She did not need to weep anymore. Once the Lord reveals Himself to us, there is no need to say anything more. The Lord only said "Mary" once, and she immediately recognized that it was the Lord. Brothers and sisters, do we recognize the voice of the Lord?</P><P>There was one brother who knew of a family with only a mother and her son. Every evening the son rode home on a bicycle. When he was near home, he always whistled. His mother always knew when her son was back. One day this brother was talking to the mother in her home. As he was preparing to leave, she asked him to stay because her son would soon be home. He asked how she knew, and she replied that she had heard the sound of her son's whistling. To other people this sound had no meaning, but to his mother it was especially meaningful. The Lord said, "Mary." Other people may not have felt anything, but Mary recognized this voice. Once she heard it, she recognized that this was the Lord.</P><P>Following this, "Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God." In Matthew 28, because the women were worshipping Him, the Lord allowed them to touch Him. Here the Lord did not allow Mary to touch Him. What does this mean? Mary had a strong desire to keep the Lord on the earth. She wanted to catch Him and not let go of Him. But what the Lord received on the earth was nothing more than the crown of thorns, the cross, and the tomb. Now the Lord would ascend to the heavens, to the place of "My Father and your Father, and My God and your God." This is why He said to Mary, "Do not touch Me." Do not keep Him on the earth. The Lord not only resurrected, but He also ascended, becoming the Head of the new mankind and the representative of man. Man had never been in the heavens. By the ascension of the Lord Jesus, the first man went there. Now, those who believe in Him will also go there. Hebrews 2:9-10 says, "But we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor...For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory." Because of the suffering of death, the Lord received glory and honor, and many sons will also be brought into glory. The Lord has gone. The disciples will go too. After resurrection the disciples were called brothers by the Lord for the first time. In other words, the Lord is the firstborn, and we are the many sons. The Lord resurrected and ascended. His Father is also our Father; His God is also our God. Therefore, the Lord said to Mary, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God."</P><P>Now what else did Mary have to say? She had nothing more to say. She had enough. She truly had enough. Therefore, Mary went back. Now she could go back. Brothers and sisters, if you lack this revelation, if you have not seen the Lord and have not heard the word of the Lord, can you blame the Lord? No. You cannot blame the Lord, because you do not have Mary's hunger. Please ask yourselves if you have deeply longed for the Lord. Have you longed for the Son of God from the heart? Do you know that the heart of the Lord will never be touched by your rank or by your reputation? But if you truly long for the Lord, even if but for a short time, His heart will be touched! May God create in you a desire so that you will long after the Son of God and love Him single-heartedly.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>REMEMBERING CHRISTMAS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 28</H2><P>December is right in front of us, and many people will again celebrate Christmas. According to the opinions of many believers, it is a good thing to have a day each year to remember the Savior's birth. I dare not treat the opinions of God's children lightly. However, apart from man's opinion, God's Word, the Bible, is still the only standard and the highest standard. Our concern lies not with what man speaks, but with what God has spoken. This is what we care about. "Thus saith the Lord" is the supreme judge over all things.</P><P>Does the Bible have a command to remember the birth of Christ? If God's children are willing to ask this question, they will receive the shining of God's light. What a pity that so many have forgotten the necessity of asking this question. According to the Bible, during the last supper, the Lord only asked us to remember His death. He did not command us to celebrate Christmas, nor did He command us to celebrate Easter! These things are poison from Roman Catholicism. Only one who believes in the Bible will know that the things God did not command and the things God did command have the same significance.</P><P>Many say, "God never put a stop to the celebration of Christmas." But did God ever command us to observe Christmas? It is sad when Christians search the Scriptures to give a basis for their sin and an occasion to the flesh. They say, "The Bible does not prohibit this, so why can we not do it?" Oh, how I wish that God's children would not speak in this way. May God give us more strength to enable us to say, "How do we dare do what God has not commanded?"</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AND PETER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 29</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Mark 16:7; Matt. 28:7</H1><P>Can you find the difference between these two passages after reading them? The Gospel of Matthew says that after the Lord's resurrection, an angel told the women to tell His disciples of His resurrection. The Gospel of Mark records that the angel asked the women to tell the Lord's disciples and Peter. Oh, the words "and Peter" cause tears to fall. All of the four Gospels record the story of the Lord's resurrection. But only the Gospel of Mark has the words "and Peter." Since John was the one whom the Lord loved, why does the Bible not say "and John"? Since Thomas was doubtful about the Lord's resurrection, why does it not say "and Thomas"? The angel did not mention the best disciples or the most needy disciples. He specifically mentioned Peter. Why? What made Peter different from the others?</P><P>What kind of person was Peter? Three days before the resurrection, Peter committed a great sin, a sin that would cause the Lord not to confess him before the Father's angels. Peter not only denied the Lord before men, he even denied the Lord before a maid who was despised by others at that time. But the Lord wanted the women to tell the disciples and Peter about His resurrection. The words "and Peter" have a very deep meaning! If any brother or sister had Peter's experience, they might think:</P><P>"Oh! I have fallen. The sin which I have committed is not a common sin. I am afraid that I cannot draw close to the Lord anymore. The Lord might have already forsaken me. I am afraid that from now on, whenever the Lord has any important thing to do, He will not take me along. I will not be able to have special experiences like I had when I was with Him on the mount of transfiguration. I will not be able to accompany Him like I did in the garden of Gethsemane. I told the Lord that I would die for Him, and the Lord said that before the cock crowed twice, I would deny Him three times. I thought that the Lord misunderstood me. When He was taken, I even cut off a man's ear with a sword, thinking that I could love Him courageously. Yet I fell. I did not fall before the high priest or before the powerful Pilate, but before the questioning of a maid. I denied the Lord once, twice, and finally I even swore in my denial of the Lord. At one time I confessed that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God. At another time I said to Him, `Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life.' But eventually, I fell just as the Lord was about to be crucified. I committed the great sin of denying Him. Although I cried with regret, I do not know how the Lord is going to treat me. It would have been better if He had not known that I denied Him. But when I denied Him, He turned His back and looked at me. He knew what I had done. What should I do? I dare not come close to Him anymore. Although He loves me, I dare not approach Him because there is a sin which separates me from Him. Perhaps from now on, I cannot be close to Him. Yet, after the Lord resurrected, several women brought back word that they were to specifically tell me about it. Oh, the Lord has not forsaken me, even though I denied Him three times. He does not hate me, nor is He angry with me. His heart was thinking of me. He did not mention anyone but me specifically. It is as though He was only thinking about me. `And Peter!' `And Peter!' These words are truly the most beautiful music in the world, the most wonderful tidings! If the Lord had only told the women to tell the disciples, I would have thought that I was no longer worthy of being His disciple and that I was no longer one of His disciples. I would not dare to go see Him. But since the Lord said, `and Peter,' I know that He still wants me. Although I do not have the strength to go see Him, `and Peter' encourages me to go. The message brought back by the women is true. The Lord told the angel to mention my name specifically. The Lord did not forsake me. I can still draw near to Him. Let me rise up and go see Him!"</P><P>Here was a fallen, sinful Peter, a Peter who had denied the Lord. Yet the Lord specifically mentioned him. This is the gospel! Brothers and sisters, do you know that once the Lord saves you, He saves you eternally? Although you may be discouraged, the Lord will never be discouraged. A sinful person like you may feel shame in turning back to Him, but the One you have sinned against considers that there is nothing wrong in returning to Him. Why should you keep thinking of your failure when He is not concerned with it? If the Lord can remove the veil from your face today, you will not fear Him or be afraid to come near to Him. Peter might have remembered that he said to the Lord, "If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled" (Matt. 26:33). He might have also remembered what he said at the lake of Gennesaret, when he saw the glory of the Lord: "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord" (Luke 5:8). After Peter realized his true condition, how could he dare see the Lord again? He might have remembered the Lord's pleading: "So were you not able to watch with Me for one hour?" He might have heard the Lord's command in his ear: "Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation" (Matt. 26:40-41). His condition was far below the Lord's requirements. How could he dare to go see Him? But he went to meet the Lord anyway. He dared to go because of the words "and Peter." Brothers and sisters, if you know the Lord's intention behind the words "and Peter," will you still turn away from Him, instead of turning toward Him? If you realize the profound significance of the words "and Peter," you have to come near to the Lord.</P><P>Among the four Gospels, only the Gospel of Mark records this matter. Mark was a young man who followed and learned from Peter. The Gospel of Mark was dictated by Peter and written down by Mark. The words "tell His disciples and Peter" were specifically dictated by Peter. These words might not have been important to other people, but they were very important in Peter's heart. When the Holy Spirit was writing the Bible, He specifically wanted to show us that, even though these few words were considered unimportant by Matthew, Luke, and John, they were very unforgettable and important to Peter who dictated the Gospel of Mark. "And Peter" had special meaning for him. Each remembrance of these words was sweet. Words of grace are especially memorable to the person who receives the grace.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, when you are at the Lord's table meeting remembering the Lord, are you still afraid of God in your heart? Is there any sin separating you from God? You may have deeply wept, repented, and admitted that you disappointed the Lord. But do you dare say to the Lord, "Lord, I come to You"? Please consider this: If He was willing to go to the cross because He loved you, would He stop loving you just because you failed, fell, and backslid? Would the love He had on the cross decrease? It may be very easy for you not to love Him, draw near to Him, or return to Him; but it is impossible for Him to forget you, forsake you, or not love you. During the three days after the Lord was crucified, Peter was silent because he had fallen. But the Lord did not forget him. Therefore, if you do not have the strength to come to the Lord, as long as you are willing to believe in His words, He will give you the strength to draw near to Him. If you fall, He can make you rise up again. Although it seems that you will not be able to draw near to Him anymore, remember in faith the words "and Peter," and you will be able to draw near to Him. When you want to come close to the Lord, but feel that you are very far from Him and have no strength to come near to Him, you need to remember the words "and Peter." The more Peter fell, the more the Lord wanted to remember him. Although Peter dared not come too close to the Lord, the Lord's heart attracted him and kept him from running away from Him. May you not misunderstand the Lord's heart. If you ever hear the words "and Peter," you should know that the Lord has not forsaken you. The Lord did not desert Peter, and neither has He forsaken you. "And Peter" means "and you"-"you" who have failed like Peter. May you see the Lord's heart for you. If you see the Lord's heart, you will run toward Him.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AND PETER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 29</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Mark 16:7; Matt. 28:7</H1><P>Can you find the difference between these two passages after reading them?

If you realize the profound significance of the words "and Peter," you have to come near to the Lord.</P><P>Among the four Gospels, only the Gospel of Mark records this matter. Mark was a young man who followed and learned from Peter. The Gospel of Mark was dictated by Peter and written down by Mark. The words "tell His disciples and Peter" were specifically dictated by Peter. These words might not have been important to other people, but they were very important in Peter's heart. When the Holy Spirit was writing the Bible, He specifically wanted to show us that, even though these few words were considered unimportant by Matthew, Luke, and John, they were very unforgettable and important to Peter who dictated the Gospel of Mark. "And Peter" had special meaning for him. Each remembrance of these words was sweet. Words of grace are especially memorable to the person who receives the grace.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, when you are at the Lord's table meeting remembering the Lord, are you still afraid of God in your heart? Is there any sin separating you from God? You may have deeply wept, repented, and admitted that you disappointed the Lord. But do you dare say to the Lord, "Lord, I come to You"? Please consider this: If He was willing to go to the cross because He loved you, would He stop loving you just because you failed, fell, and backslid? Would the love He had on the cross decrease? It may be very easy for you not to love Him, draw near to Him, or return to Him; but it is impossible for Him to forget you, forsake you, or not love you. During the three days after the Lord was crucified, Peter was silent because he had fallen. But the Lord did not forget him. Therefore, if you do not have the strength to come to the Lord, as long as you are willing to believe in His words, He will give you the strength to draw near to Him. If you fall, He can make you rise up again. Although it seems that you will not be able to draw near to Him anymore, remember in faith the words "and Peter," and you will be able to draw near to Him. When you want to come close to the Lord, but feel that you are very far from Him and have no strength to come near to Him, you need to remember the words "and Peter." The more Peter fell, the more the Lord wanted to remember him. Although Peter dared not come too close to the Lord, the Lord's heart attracted him and kept him from running away from Him. May you not misunderstand the Lord's heart. If you ever hear the words "and Peter," you should know that the Lord has not forsaken you. The Lord did not desert Peter, and neither has He forsaken you. "And Peter" means "and you"-"you" who have failed like Peter. May you see the Lord's heart for you. If you see the Lord's heart, you will run toward Him.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>IN NOTHING BE ANXIOUS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 30</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 4:4-7</H1><P>Everyone likes to rejoice. No one likes to be sorrowful. For man to rejoice and not be sorrowful, he must not have any burden. Otherwise, he will not be able to rejoice. According to the Bible, there are two kinds of burdens: one is the burden of sin, and the other is the burden of anxiety. If the burden of sin is not resolved, there is no joy; if the burden of anxiety is not resolved, there is also no joy. If the burden of sin is resolved but the burden of anxiety is not, the joy is not complete. At the same time, if the burden of anxiety is resolved but the burden of sin is not, the joy cannot be complete either. The burdens of sin and anxiety must be resolved together in order for one to rejoice.</P><P>Today what we will speak is for Christians. We will consider how a Christian can have joy. Since all Christians are saved, the burden of sin has already been resolved! However, if their burden of anxiety is not resolved, they still cannot rejoice. If Christians are not joyful, they put the Lord and His name to shame. This means that they do not trust in Him and that they doubt Him. Christians know that their sins are forgiven and that they are saved; they know that they are children of God. But many Christians are not joyful. This lack of joy is surely not God's portion for Christians. The verses we will read show us how to have joy. When we are free from anxiety, we can rejoice.</P><P>But how many Christians can always rejoice? Christians today are putting the Lord's name to shame. The Lord's will is that we know our sins and come to Him for forgiveness so that we can have the authority to become children of God through the redemption of the Lord's blood. All these things are good, but He also wants us to always rejoice. If we do not have joy, we do not have the proper living and attitude of a Christian. Christians must always rejoice. If we read the Bible, we will find out that believers ought to live in joy and without anxiety. Let us now look into Philippians 4:4-7 phrase by phrase.</P><P>Philippians 4:4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice." The first thing we have to know is that rejoicing is a commandment of God. God never commands us to do what we cannot do. Every command of God to man can be done by man. The Bible commands us not to be happy, but to rejoice in the Lord. We should not only rejoice in the Lord, but rejoice in Him always. If a man worships idols, we know that this violates God's commandment. But we may not realize that if a Christian is not rejoicing, he is also breaking God's commandment. We may think that if we worship idols we are breaking the commandments but if we do not rejoice, we are not breaking the commandments. Actually, in both cases we are breaking His commandments. Since rejoicing is a command of God, we must practice accordingly; otherwise, we are breaking God's commandment. Perhaps you may think, "I have such and such a problem. How can I rejoice? I am a laborer and have to support a family. Even though I toil and sweat, I do not earn much in wages, and living expenses are so high. How can I rejoice?" As a result, you may become anxious. Perhaps you are a mother and a widow. You have many children and a meager income which does not adequately cover your expenses. Since you live from hand to mouth, you may think, "How can a person like me rejoice?" Perhaps you are a student, doctor, master, or servant, and you feel that it is difficult to deal with other people in the world. You cannot rejoice. Indeed, many things can make you unable to rejoice. But please note that the rejoicing in verse 4 is not to rejoice in yourself, but to "rejoice in the Lord always."</P><P>A widow who has just lost her husband, whose possessions are about to be pawned, and whose landlord is about to drive her out of the house is suffering greatly under these circumstances. Yet she can still play with her little baby. She cannot rejoice in the house, her deceased husband, or her surroundings. But she can rejoice. She can rejoice in her baby. In the same way, God has not asked us to rejoice in our environment, in things going our way, or in any kind of happiness. God tells us to "rejoice in the Lord." The world may oppose us, misunderstand us, reject us, and trap us, but no one can cover the heavens from us. The Lord never changes. The world could put Paul into prison and lock him up, but it could not keep the Lord within Paul away from him. Therefore, Paul and Silas were able to sing and praise God within the prison cell. We should be clear about one thing: do not rejoice in the environment; rather, rejoice in our Lord. When friends and relatives are away and the heart is aching and weeping, we can be comforted and rejoice if we look to the Lord who loves us and whom we love. He is enough to satisfy our heart. But Christians are very forgetful! We may hear about this today but forget about it tomorrow! This is why Paul followed by saying, "Again I will say, rejoice." God's intention is that we rejoice. Therefore, whatever happens, we must rejoice.</P><P>"Let your forbearance be known to all men." "Forbearance" in the original text has a meaning of moderation. It means to not incline to the left or the right, to not be too much or too little. If a Christian feels crushed under a great mountain as soon as he encounters some problems, he is not moderate. The world may press us, but the Lord gives us joy. This joy is great, and it enables us to pass our days joyfully in the midst of difficulties. This is the principle of moderation according to the Bible. It is not the moderation the world teaches.</P><P>Verse 5 says, "The Lord is near." Please consider this word. Some have said that this refers to the coming of the Lord. But this is not reliable for two reasons: (1) In the phrase "the Lord is near," the word "near" is not an adverb but an adjective; and (2) according to the original text, the word "near" occurs only four times in the New Testament. These include Romans 10:8, Ephesians 2:13 and 17, and Philippians 4:5. The meaning in the fourth instance should be the same as the first three instances. Whatever is referred to in the first three instances should be what is referred to in the fourth instance as well. In the first three instances, "near" refers to location. Therefore, in the fourth instance, it must also refer to location. Romans 10:8 says, "But what does it say? `The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,' that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim." This refers to location. Ephesians 2:13 says, "But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ." This also refers to location. Ephesians 2:17 says, "And coming, He announced peace as the gospel to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near." This also refers to location. Therefore, "the Lord is near" in Philippians 4:5 must also refer to location. This means that the Lord is near to us; it does not mean that the Lord is coming soon. It is wonderful to know that the Lord is near us and can help us. We should rejoice always because He is beside us. We should rejoice because He has drawn near to us.</P><P>Verse 6 says, "In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God." We must rejoice because the Lord is near; we must also not be anxious because He is near. The preceding verse says that we should rejoice, and this verse says that we should be anxious in nothing. Do we realize that other than sin, nothing harms man more than anxiety? Indeed, anxiety is a sin.</P><P>There are many excuses for us to be anxious. There are many good reasons in this world for us to be anxious every day. It is not difficult to find these reasons. We argue that it is unavoidable for us to be anxious when we are faced with these circumstances. But God considers that we have no excuse to be anxious. All the anxieties are without a reason. Therefore, God tells us, "In nothing be anxious." We think the problems of our living, family affairs, and personal difficulties are matters for us to be anxious about. But the Bible says, "In nothing be anxious." Not a single anxiety is legitimate, nor is it allowed by God. Every anxiety is forbidden by Him.</P><P>I read in a book that a pastor once told a woman to be anxious in nothing because it was a sin to be anxious. The woman said that the only thing she was anxious about was her nine sons. The pastor repeated that in nothing should she be anxious. The woman argued that God's word concerning being anxious in nothing did not include such an anxiety. The pastor answered that when God says to be anxious in nothing, He means to be anxious in nothing. The woman insisted that a mother ought to be anxious for her sons. She said, "My anxiety has followed four of my sons to heaven already. Now I still have to be anxious for the other five." Some people think that they should worry about this and about that, as if it is their duty to worry. Others ask, "Should not one be anxious about one or two things in a year?" No. Why? It is because "the Lord is near." Your anxiety indicates that you do not trust in His heart or in His promise. You are shaming the Lord. The Lord is near, but you are anxious; you doubt the power of His hand and the kindness of His heart. The reason you are anxious is because you do not know that the Lord is near.</P><P>Verse 6 continues, "But in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God." How can you be without anxiety? "But"! As long as you follow this "but," everything will be fine. Whether you are sitting, lying down, or walking, you can make everything known to God in three ways: (1) by prayer-ordinary prayer, (2) by petition-definite and specific prayer (through prayer and petition you can tell God the requests in your heart), and (3) with thanksgiving-thanking God for everything. Through giving thanks, you also tell God your needs. You should make known everything to God by prayer, petition, and thanksgiving. But you do not; therefore, you are full of anxiety and short of joy. You have disobeyed God's commandment, and you cannot be free from anxiety.</P><P>It would be wonderful if we would commit the things we encounter into God's hand item by item. Otherwise, when the first thing comes up, we lay it upon ourselves. Then when the second and third things come up, we also lay them upon ourselves. In this way, we are pressed and lose our joy. Once I saw builders moving tiles to the roof of a house. Three men stood on a ladder, one at the top, the second in the middle, and the third at the bottom. The one at the bottom would hand the tiles over to the one in the middle. After the one in the middle received the tiles, he would hand them to the one at the top. They continued this way unceasingly. When I saw this I thought, "What if the man in the middle did not pass on the tiles he received, or what if the man on the top refused to take the tiles passed to him?" If that happened, the one in the middle would eventually be crushed to death by the tiles that were continuously coming to him. We deal with anxiety in this manner. If we do not send all the anxieties to God to let Him bear them, all the anxieties of this world will crush us to death. We must not allow the anxieties of the world to keep pressing upon us; we must place them on God's side. The moment we have anxiety, we must immediately entrust it to the Lord. We do not have to tolerantly accumulate anxieties upon ourselves item by item. There is a way out. The way is, "In everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God." This is something that the world and sinners cannot do. Only Christians can do this because we have the Lord, and the Lord is near. Not only can we pray for great things, but for small things as well. We can pray for everything that we have a reason to be anxious about. Everything which affords an opportunity to worry about can be prayed for. The reason we can be anxious in nothing is not that we are naturally optimistic or that we try to be mindless in everything like foolish ones. Such conduct is indeed foolish. Rather, we can be anxious in nothing because we have One to talk to, One whom we can trust, and One who will be responsible. We can rejoice and be free from anxiety because we have God and because we can entrust all things to God through prayers. Prayer is our way out. God is our way out.</P><P>Is it enough to have prayer and petition alone? No. The Bible mentions not only prayer and petition but also thanksgiving. We must remember that everything that comes upon us has been placed in our hand by the nail-pierced hands; everything that comes upon us has been arranged by the Lord who died for us. Therefore, we can thank God ahead of time, saying, "God, You can never be wrong." There are many today who can preach and many today who can pray. But there are few who can give thanks. Preaching is giving something of God to man, while prayer is acquiring something from God. Thanksgiving is consecrating ourselves to God and offering our sacrifice of thanks. The Bible not only says that we should pray and petition; it also says that we should give thanks. In what things do we give thanks to God? We should not only give thanks to Him when we are happy; we should also give thanks when we are sorrowful. In everything we give thanks to God. We should thank God not only for the things that we consider as good, but also for the things that we consider to be bad.</P><P>There was a university professor in the western part of the United States who was always sad and liked to utter dejected words. This turned his colleagues away from him. One day the weather was very good, and a number of his younger colleagues said to him, "The sun is so bright today. The birds' chirping sounds are so sweet, and the grass looks so fresh. You ought to have no complaint about this scene." Looking around he was somewhat convinced that there was nothing to complain about. But did he stop his grievance? No. After a further glance he said, "This scene will not last." Oh, many Christians are like this man. They never have a heart of gratitude toward God. They only have sighings, murmurings, sorrows, and burdens; they never have a heart of gratitude.</P><P>There was a Christian who worked in a railroad station. He always gave thanks to God whether in sickness or in health and whether or not his circumstances were smooth. All of his co-workers said he was an optimist. One day while he was repairing the track of the railroad, a train ran over his leg and he fainted. After he regained consciousness, people heard him thanking God again! They were angry and wondered how he could still thank God when one of his legs was cut off. He said, "I thank God because I still have one good leg!" Brothers and sisters, you may be sick, but you are still alive. You may be poor, but you are not destitute. You may have coarse clothing, but you still have something to put on. Your house may be small, but you still have a place to lay your head. You should learn to seek for opportunities to thank God. If you do this, you may have reasons to be anxious, but you will not have opportunity to be anxious. Every time you give your anxiety and burden to God, you cannot help but rejoice. If you say that you have burdens and anxieties, you have to realize that the Lord has borne your sins on the cross. Will He not bear your sorrows, difficulties, and anxieties as well?</P><P>First Peter 5:7 says, "Casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you." God wants us to cast all our anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning us. He wants to bear our burden. The word "matters" in the original language belongs to the same root as the word "anxiety" in the same verse; the two are different only in their grammatical forms. This means that God bears our anxieties; He takes up our anxiety for us. Therefore, we do not have to be anxious! Many people extend invitations to others with the purpose of receiving joy, gifts, friendship, and other things; they expect gain from others. But our God has not invited us to give Him joy, goodness, or friendship. He has invited us to come before Him and cast our anxieties on Him. God is a God who bears our anxiety. He beckons us to lay our anxiety on Him. To Him this is no hardship. Isaiah 53:4 said that the Lord Jesus has "borne our sicknesses and carried our sorrows."</P><P>If you worry about your immediate problems, the break up of your family, the moral degradation of your children and their waywardness from the Lord, the failure of your business, the frictions between in-laws, the salvation of others, or the backward and fallen spiritual condition of God's children, your should realize that God wants you to cast your anxiety on Him. In the midst of all these problems, God is asking you to come to Him. God is asking you to come not with your good things, but with your anxieties and worries. He will bear your anxieties. All of you who have a broken heart, a heavy heart, and a pained heart, come unto God! Today you need not be anxious anymore! This is the gospel.</P><P>What will be the result if we let our requests be made known to God in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving? There will be the best result. Philippians 4:7 says, "And the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus." The word "guard" in the original language is a special military term. We can translate it as "garrison" or "patrol." The same word is used in 2 Corinthians 11:32: "In Damascus, the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me." The governor of Damascus wanted to seize Paul, and he put garrisons of soldiers around the city. In the same way, God's peace is patrolling our heart like the soldiers garrisoning the city, and His peace is keeping our heart in peace. No anxiety can break through this line and come into our heart. God's peace is patrolling, garrisoning, and guarding our heart from the invasion of all anxieties. How amazing this is! What else could "the peace of God" possibly mean?</P><P>Originally, all of God's creation was wonderful and beautiful. But the archangel (who later became the devil) sinned, and one third of the angels followed him and also sinned. The earth became waste and void. Was God anxious about this? No. He finished His recovery work within six days and created a couple to live on the earth. Then they too committed sin. Was God anxious about this? No. Although the angels fell and man fell, God was not anxious. God sent forth the Savior to save men. According to our concept, as soon as man sinned, God should have sent forth the Savior. But God was not anxious. When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman (Gal. 4:4). He waited several thousand years; He was not in a hurry. Even today, according to our concept, the best thing to do is to shuffle everybody into the church. But God is not in a hurry. This is the peace of God. Even if men attack Him, oppose Him, and deny Him, He does not send thunder and lightning to kill them. He is at peace. This is the peace of God. Although He encounters many adversities, He is still very much at peace. If we have such a peace of God to garrison our heart and mind, can anxiety invade us? Is there anything that can take away our peace?</P><P>God has commanded that we should let our requests be made known to Him in everything through prayer and petition with thanksgiving. He has promised that He will send us His own peace like soldiers guarding our hearts, keeping out all worries, sufferings, and discomforts. The peace of God indeed is the peace which passes all understanding; it is the peace which man cannot understand and cannot otherwise have. The phrase "surpasses every man's understanding" means beyond human expectation. If we commit everything to Him, we will have the peace which is beyond human understanding and which man cannot otherwise possess. This peace will guard our hearts and thoughts and enable us to safely pass through every storm in the worldly sea. Dear brothers, have you experienced the peace of God? Are you aware of the garrison of His peace? Do you know what it means for God's peace to guard your hearts and your thoughts? Thank God! Many times it seems that the pressure is too great and that there is no way of escape. It seems that anxiety and grief is your sole obligation. But when you tell God what you want, in prayer and petition, on the one hand, and with thanksgiving, on the other, you will feel as if you do not even know how to be anxious anymore. You will be surprised, and others will marvel at your peace. This is the peace which passes all understanding. This is the garrison of the peace of God.</P><P>Verse 7 also says, "Guard your hearts and your thoughts." This does not mean to guard your environment or keep your environment in peace. It means to keep your heart in peace. This sentence can also be translated as "making your hearts and thoughts belong to Jesus Christ." This means to turn your hearts and thoughts to the Lord. If you have any difficulty or pain which you cannot bear, you can say, "God, I commit this to Your hand." If you have obeyed His commandment, He will fulfill His promise.</P><P>Once, I encountered a difficulty which seemed to afford me no way out. At that time I remembered this verse, and I went to a deserted field to pray. I prayed more than ten times, but there was still no peace within. I thought, "Can it be that this verse is only good for others and cannot be put into practice by me?" At that point God told me, "I have said be anxious in nothing and you will have peace. But now you say that you have no peace!" I jumped up and said, "O God, You said that I have peace. I will surely have peace; I will not say anything anymore." When I believed God's words, I immediately had the peace. Therefore, brothers and sisters, if you do not believe God's Word, you will have no peace. Believe and you will have peace. If you want to wait for the peace before believing, you will never have it. If there is any difficulty or suffering beyond what you can bear, tell God, "O God, I commit them into Your hand." If you do this, you will have peace. "Rejoice in the Lord always" and "In nothing be anxious" are God's commandments. "And the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus" is His promise. If you obey His command, He will fulfill His promise.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD IS WILLING</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 31</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 3:16</H1><P>Most people in this world do not like to be misunderstood. Sometimes good intentions can be misunderstood as bad intentions, or love can be misunderstood as hatred. There are many undesirable things in this world, and being misunderstood is certainly one of them. However, the most misunderstood One in the whole world is God! The misunderstanding we experience is only a fraction of what God experiences. He is the most misunderstood One in the whole world!</P><P>I read a story in the newspaper a few days ago. There was a so-called pastor who was a very aged man. One day he met a young man on the street who said, "Oh, a terrible thing has happened to me!" While he was speaking, tears began to fall. The pastor asked him what was the matter. He replied, "Terrible!" and then he cried. When the young man was asked again, he brought out a letter from his pocket and said, "This was mailed to me from a lawyer." The pastor asked, "Have you read it?" He answered, "Not yet. I dare not read it because I am afraid something unusual has happened. Lawyers' notices never bring good news." The pastor replied, "Read the letter, and find out what has happened." The young man answered, "It is bad luck for anyone to receive a letter from a lawyer. I do not like to receive a lawyer's letter." The pastor offered, "Well, let me read it for you." The young man agreed. After the pastor read the letter, he asked the young man, "You really have not read this letter?" The young man replied, "No." The pastor then told him, "This letter is to notify you that one of your relatives has died and left you an inheritance. The executor is at a certain place now, and you may go there and receive more than twenty thousand dollars." Brothers and sisters, our attitude toward God is just like this young man's. When we hear the name God, we do not like it and feel uneasy. It seems as if God is hard to deal with and does not have good intentions toward men. There are two groups of people sitting here today. One group has heard about God and believed in the Lord Jesus. The other group has not believed in God and in the Lord Jesus. I know that those who have believed can give a testimony that before they believed in God, the very name God or Jesus would make them unhappy. They were like the young man who did not want to read the lawyer's letter. But after they truly believed, they all wished that they had believed earlier. The profit one receives in believing in Jesus is far better than receiving an inheritance. What God has said is much better than what the lawyer said to the young man. God's Word tells us that those who believe in the Lord Jesus will go to heaven and have eternal life. I also can give the same testimony. Today the first thing I will exhort you to do is not be afraid of hearing about God. Do not think that God has bad intentions toward you. If you are willing to listen and if you hear what I say, you will know what kind of God He is.</P><P>A number of years ago, as I was preaching in Southeast Asia, I met a child. I told him to believe in Jesus. He said, "Mr. Nee, I can be friends with you, but believing in Jesus is not a good thing to do." When I met him the second time I again asked him to believe in Jesus. He answered me the same way. I then asked him why he thought this way. He said, "I had a brother who believed in Jesus when he was six years old, and then he died. If I believe in Jesus and then die just like my brother, what good is it to me?" Oh, he misunderstood God! How did he misunderstand God? He misunderstood God's heart! Please close your eyes and think for a moment about how you view God? You may think God has a black face and is evil and strict. You may think that God wants to see man sin and go to hell. What is your idea about God?</P><P>Once I met a relative of mine. He had a Ph.D. and was a professor at Manchuria University. I exhorted him to believe in the Lord Jesus at that time. He said, "Your God is not good. Your God does nothing good in heaven. From heaven He records the evil deeds of this person and that person. He does it like bookkeeping, and He uses this book to judge and condemn people to hell. Your God does not have a good heart. All He does in heaven is record the evil deeds of all kinds of people. His heart is very devious, and He wishes men to go to hell." Oh, he misunderstood God! He misunderstood God's heart. You may think, "God hates me. He does not want me to be saved; He is anxiously waiting to condemn me and bring me to perdition; He wants me to go to hell." However, I must tell you today that I know my God! My message today is to tell you one thing; if you really understand the message, you will not give up this God. Now I beg you to listen to the Word of God.</P><P>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world"! God is love. Please pay attention: God is love! It is so wonderful that God is not only thinking about you, caring for you, paying attention to you, and being merciful to you, He also loves you. A few days ago I was strolling in a park and met a classmate of mine. I asked him to believe in Jesus. I continually exhorted him, but he would not accept. In the end I almost burst into tears. If he only knew how loving God is toward him! Men very easily misunderstand God's love! You might think, "What kind of God is this God? Does He want to save me? Can He save a person like me?" Men are always full of doubts. But God not only is merciful toward you, He not only cares for you and pays attention to you, He also loves you. Throughout the ages, the most difficult thing God has done is love men. After man sinned, the first thing God did was love. God is full of good intention toward men. He is anxious for men to be saved. You may think that He is fierce and vicious and that He likes to see you far away from Him. But God gave us this book, the Bible, the Word of God, which tells us that God is love! Even though you are a sinner, God loves you. Even though you are far away from God, He loves you. Time after time, God sent His servants to tell men about His intentions. He said, "Can a woman forget her nursing child, / That she would not have compassion on the son of her womb? / Even though they may forget, / Yet I will not forget you" (Isa. 49:15). Oh, He so loved us. He once used a good illustration: "If a man divorces his wife / And she goes from him / And becomes another man's wife, / Will he return to her again? / Will not that land be / Utterly polluted? But you have committed fornication with many lovers. / Yet return to Me" (Jer. 3:1). Oh, God is so willing to accept sinners. But men do not believe that God loves the world. They always doubt that God can be so nice. But I have to say that God is love! God so loved the world that He decided that He Himself would come to the earth and become flesh in order to show men His love.</P><P>Once I went to Lushan Mountain. I like the flowers and birds on that mountain. I do not like to place birds in cages; I like to see them flying freely. One day the birds came and ate up all the rice I left on the railing. This was very interesting, and I went and got a whole bowl of rice. As soon as I walked close to them, the birds flew away; after I left, they all flew back. I had no intention to catch them or hurt them. I was more than happy for them to come and eat my rice. I thought it would be the happiest thing for me to sit in the midst of the birds while they surrounded me on all sides. But they did not know my heart, and they always avoided me. If I wanted the birds to know my heart, the only way was for me to speak their language or become a bird flying among them and telling them my intention. Then I would not be misunderstood. But there was no way that I could become a bird; consequently, there was no way for me to show my heart to them. This is the same way God feels about us. God loves us; He likes us. He wants us to be close to Him. But we do not understand His heart. God's Word tells us that God has spoken of old in many portions and in many ways through His servants concerning His heart's desire and that He loves us. But man did not understand. Therefore, God had to personally come to this world and become a man. This man is Jesus, the Christ, whom we know. If I became a bird, you might say that I humiliated myself. But for God to become a man is more of a humiliation. What humility that the God of glory would lower Himself to become a man! He is far above all, but He emptied Himself, took the form of man, and came in the likeness of men. When Jesus was on the earth, everything He did expressed God's love toward men. If you read the life of Jesus, you will find out that He is not only a good man but God from heaven becoming a man. We thought that God hated us. But He became a man in order to show us that God is the same as Jesus. He was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years; during this time He expressed God's heart. God is the same as Jesus. The way Jesus treated men is the way God treats men.</P><P>Once, a man full of leprosy came to worship Jesus and said, "Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me" (Luke 5:12). Jesus very easily could have made him clean by one of His words. Instead, He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed!" (v. 13). A man full of leprosy is unclean and smelly! But the Lord put forth His hand and touched him. He sympathized with this man. He seemed to be saying, "If others are not willing to come to Me, and you are willing, I will touch you."</P><P>Another time, a woman caught in adultery was brought to the Lord (John 8:3-11). According to the law, such a woman should be stoned to death. The Lord Jesus could not say that she did not commit sin, yet He did not want to see her stoned to death. Therefore, He said, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her" (v. 7). They were all convicted in their own consciences and left one by one, from the oldest to the youngest. Then Jesus was left alone, and the woman stood before Him. What did the Lord say? He said, "Has no one condemned you?" (v. 10). She said, "No one, Lord." Jesus then said, "Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more" (v. 11).</P><P>O friends! If you have not believed, let me tell you that God does not hate you; rather He loves you.</P><P>On another occasion, a publican named Matthew invited many publicans and sinners to his house, and he also invited Jesus. At that time the publicans were a very despised kind of people. The Jews had lost their country and were under the domination of Rome. For a Jew to work for those who conquered his country and dealt harshly with his own people, was something very despicable. If it were us, we would not have eaten or drunk with them. But Jesus ate and drank with them. Would you as a college student be willing to sit with such people? You might think that if a newspaper reporter found out that you were socializing with such people, it would be a big disgrace to you. But in any case, Jesus went. At that time there was another kind of people called the Pharisees. When they saw this, they spoke to Jesus' disciples, saying, "Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?" They were debating and criticizing. But how did Jesus reply? He said, "Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill...For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners" (Matt. 9:10-13). Jesus opened up God's heart to men. Some may wonder, "Does God still want me? I am such a terrible sinner." Others may wonder if God would want persons like themselves because they have robbed others, committed adultery, told lies, and been unclean and filthy sinners. But Jesus has opened up God's heart and shown us that God wants us and loves us. He is, in effect, saying, "I am like a doctor, and I am not afraid of patients." Are patients afraid of doctors? Of course they are not afraid. Some may make up their minds to be better persons from now on, never losing their temper, playing cards, or going to the movies. But they can only do this for two or three days; then they misbehave again. Some may think that God does not like them and wants them to perish. But I must tell you that God wants you because He loves you! Friends, please do one thing today: remove the veils from your eyes so that you can see that God has no evil intentions toward you. He loves you.</P><P>During the European War [World War I], a preacher led a young lady to repent. Later she went to Paris and became a nurse for the Red Cross. However, she became backslidden. Then one day she went to church, and the same preacher was preaching. She was determined to say something to hurt his feelings. After the sermon was over, he came up to shake hands with her. Then she said, "I am going to tell you one thing you may not like to hear. I do not need Jesus anymore, and I can still be happy." The preacher replied, "Maybe you can be happy in the world without Jesus, but the Lord Jesus in heaven cannot be happy without you." This is true. Everyone who knows God's Word can testify that God can only be happy when He has us. God is not only merciful to us, He not only cares for us and is concerned about us, He loves us. God's love for us is more than the love of a mother for her son. God's love for us is more than the love of a couple for each other; His love is more than the love between husband and wife. We may never have thought about God's feeling towards men. But I am here to say that God loves us.</P><P>Since God is love, the Lord Jesus did two things as He passed through His years on earth. God knows that the only reason that men on the earth cannot love Him or worship Him is that men have sinned. Sinners are doomed to perdition and hell. Therefore, He came to die on the cross for us. He bore our sins so that we should not perish but have eternal life. You may have frequently heard us say that sinners are doomed to go to hell and that the Lord Jesus came and died on the cross for men and bore men's sins. Do you know why we are preaching this message to you? Let me tell you: it would be enough for a person to go to hell if he only had one sin or sinned for one second. Do you think that you can be without sin for a month or a year? Do you think that you have never done anything bad or said any bad word? You may have had an improper thought for just a second or a minute; such thoughts may be unknown even to your parents or your wife. As long as you had such a thought, you are qualified to go to hell. God hates sin. No matter how much we hate sin, our feeling cannot be compared to the feeling that God has toward even a small sin. Even if we could feel the sins of the whole earth, it would not compare to the feeling that God has toward the evil of one lie. God knew that all men had sinned, and He had only one way, which was to come to this world, become a man (Jesus Christ), and bear men's sins on the cross. This was the first big thing He did. This shows God's heart. At the same time, God knows that you have sinned and that you still may sin even though the Lord Jesus died for you. Therefore, God gives you the Holy Spirit (His own Spirit) to live in you and strengthen you to not sin. This is the second thing that God did. This also shows His heart. God gives us two great graces: one is to send the Lord Jesus to die for us so that our sins are forgiven; the other is to send the Holy Spirit to dwell in us so that we can have the strength not to sin.</P><P>Friends, do you know how difficult it is to overcome sin? For example, in the matter of honesty, I do not know how many among us are truly honest men. I have been to many places, but I have not met many honest men. Not speaking enough is a lie; speaking too politely is also a lie. If you have tried to be an honest man, you will know that it is not easy. A friend of mine ran into some bandits in Canton one day, and they asked for his money. He thought that since he was a Christian, he could not lie. But if he told the truth, his money would be taken away. In the end he reluctantly told the truth and showed the bandits the few dollars in his pocket. In this case, lying could have saved him from some losses. But in order to be honest, one cannot tell a single lie. Many times one has a bad thought in his mind which will not go away. He may hate others and not forgive others. He may be fond of criticizing and spreading rumors about others. We tell lies all the time and like to be clever. But God knows all our sins. God will not only forgive all of our sins but will also have His Spirit live inside of us. The Spirit can empower us to overcome sins and become clean. This is God's heart! What God wants to do, He has already done. I can boldly say one word concerning salvation: there is no problem on God's side. The problem is on your side. Are you willing to believe? I can boldly say that God wants you. I have many friends who are in their fifties and sixties; they can also boldly testify to you that God loves you. Let me read you some more words that Jesus said while He was on the earth:</P><P>"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!" (Matt. 23:37). God is willing, but man is not willing. Jerusalem is a city, and the Lord Jesus was crying over her. The Lord was more than willing to protect her and love her, but the children of Jerusalem would not. Is there anyone here who knows that he is a sinner? The Lord says that He loves you and wants you to be saved. Do you want to be saved today? There is no problem with God. How about you? If you have heard the gospel today, can you blame God for your going to hell? God is willing. You are the one that is not willing. God is willing, will you be willing? I am saying one thing today: God wants you, and God loves you. He says, "How often I desired...and you would not."</P><P>First Timothy 2:4 says, "Who desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth." God desires that all men be saved; this is God's heart!</P><P>John 5:40 says, "Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life." It is not that God will not give life to you; it is that you are not willing to have life! Therefore, while you are sitting here, if you have just a little desire to be saved, a tiny will to have eternal life, a tiny sensation to be released from sin, or a small wish to go to heaven, you will have it because God wants and wishes you would be this way. If you ask, you will have life. What does God want? God wants all men to have life. Do not be afraid. There is no problem on God's side; the problem lies on your side.</P><P>Once there was a man who met a gospel preacher in London. He said to the preacher, "Are you the one who preached in Paris before? Do you know that I have believed in Jesus?" The preacher said, "It is very good that you have believed." The man then said, "I believed in Jesus because of one word that you said." The preacher asked, "Which word was that?" He said, "You said that heaven's door is latched on the outside." Oh, the door latch of heaven were on the outside! You can only blame yourself if you do not enter. If the door latch of heaven were on the inside, you would not have any way to enter even if you wanted to enter. Then if God was happy, He would open it; but if He was not happy, He would close it, and you would have to knock on the door from the outside. But the door of heaven is latched on the outside! God has no problem; it all depends on your willingness to enter in.</P><P>Finally, let me tell you a story. There was a professor at Oxford University in England who was a Christian. He had many sons, and they all studied at Oxford. Every evening his house had a family worship meeting. His fourth son, the worst one, always found some excuse to skip the family worship. He would either leave right before the meeting started or would come home right after the meeting ended. One day he came home, and the meeting was not yet finished. The whole family was praying. He thought, "Let me go and see what they are praying." He became angry after he heard his mother's prayer; she said, "O God, my fourth son is a prodigal somewhere outside. He likes to play around and spend money, and he has no fear of You." The son became angry and said in his heart, "My mother did not pray for my oldest brother or my other brothers; she only prayed for me! I cannot stay in this house any longer!" He immediately ran upstairs and packed all the things in his room. He took some of his father's money and left a note to his parents, saying, "Since you do not consider me good enough to be your son, I do not want to be your son. I am leaving. Goodbye." Then he left the house. First, he stayed in a big hotel. When his money was about to run out, he moved into a friend's house. The friend said, "You can stay in my house, but not for long. Even though we are classmates, your father is my teacher. It would not be good if he found out about this." Eventually, he had no alternative but to move out of his friend's house into a small hotel. His money began to run out, and he soon did not have enough for food, clothing, or shelter. Then he decided to go home. Since it was too embarrassing to go home during the day, he waited until a little past midnight before he went home. He tried to climb through the window when he arrived, but all the windows were closed. Reluctantly, he tried the front door. To his surprise the door opened when he pushed; it was not even latched. He ran upstairs directly to his own room. When he pushed open the door, he was surprised to see his father sitting there, facing the door. He was still quite stubborn and immediately thought of something, saying, "Why is someone so careless? The front door is not even locked." His father took off his glasses and held the son's hand and said, "My son! Ever since the day you left home-for over a year-the front door has never been closed." Brothers and sisters, this is a father's heart! The door was not left open for a month or half a year; it was left open all the time. This is a father's love! Many times we think that we are sinners and that God may not want us. But friends, let me tell you that He has never closed the door. There is no problem on God's side. All the problems are on your side. If there is a sinner who will come to God and say, "I am a sinner; I have misunderstood You, but You are still willing to accept me," he will be saved.</P><P>The Lord Jesus once spoke a parable about the prodigal son. When he was a great way off, his father saw him, had compassion on him, ran, fell on his neck, and kissed him. This expresses God's heart. God is calling you home today. Jesus has died for you, and the Holy Spirit has come. No one sitting here needs to go to hell. You do not need to go to hell. But if you do not accept the Lord, there is no other way. I hope you can remember that God is love! If you will say to God, "I am a sinner. I am willing, and I want to accept You," you will be saved. Then God will rejoice, and you will also rejoice together with Him. God is love!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>DAVID AND MEPHIBOSHETH</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 32</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Sam. 4:4; 9:1-13; 16:1-4; 19:24-30; 21:7</H1><P>Today I want to look at a wonderful story from the Old Testament about a lame boy sitting at a king's table. In the Bible there are many wonderful stories: one tells us about a prostitute who was saved, one about a robber who was saved, one about a tax collector who was saved, and even one about a bad Pharisee who was saved. Today we will talk about a lame boy who was saved.</P><P>Most of the people sitting here have read the Bible. When we talk about friendship in the Bible, we often mention David and Jonathan. Some secular writers also use the story of David and Jonathan as an example of love between friends. But today I want to speak about how David graciously treated Jonathan's son, Mephibosheth, and about Mephibosheth's gratitude to David.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MEPHIBOSHETH BEING LAME<br>(2 SAMUEL 4:4)</H2><P>Second Samuel 4:4 says, "And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth."</P><P>Please pay special attention to the fact that Mephibosheth's grandfather, Saul, was David's enemy. Many times he persecuted David and wanted to put him to death. He was a great enemy of David. When Saul and Jonathan were killed, Mephibosheth's nurse took him and fled quickly. She thought that since both his grandfather and father were dead, David might come to avenge and kill Mephibosheth if they did not flee fast. The boy fell on the ground and became lame because she was running too fast. Consider for a moment: does this not look like the picture of a sinner before God?</P><P>Man has misunderstood God! I say again: man has misunderstood our God! Because man has devious thoughts about God, he thinks that God also has devious thoughts about him. Because man hates God, he thinks that God also hates him. Man knows that he has sinned, and he thinks that God hates him. Mephibosheth thought, "My grandfather was David's enemy; therefore, David must hate me. I have no love for David; therefore, David must have no love for me." This is the way we also think. We think that God has no love for us because we have no love for God. We think that God cannot love us because we hate God. But God is not the same as we. Mephibosheth had no ground to receive grace, yet he received it. The same is true with regard to us and God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DAVID SHOWING MEPHIBOSHETH KINDNESS<br>(2 SAMUEL 9:1-13)</H2><P>"And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?" (v. 1). God is also asking, "Is there yet any that is left of Adam, that I may show him grace?" David showed Mephibosheth kindness for the sake of Jonathan; God graced the sinners because of His Son Jesus. People make a great mistake in thinking that God hates man. They think that man has to do a great deal of good before God's face will be turned to them. Yet they are not sure how much good should be done before God will stop His wrath, consider them, and be pleased with them. But Mephibosheth had no position at all before David. David did not know Mephibosheth. David only knew Mephibosheth's father, Jonathan. He was gracious to Mephibosheth for Jonathan's sake. Mephibosheth did not have to do anything good before he could receive David's favor. Mephibosheth had no position at all before David. He received kindness not because of himself but because of another person. This is true for a sinner before God. Many people think, "I must do something good before I can please God." But the Bible tells us that God loves us without a reason. We did not have any position before God, and we should not have obtained His grace. But we have our Jonathan, Jesus Christ. God has graced us because of Him. We are saved because we have the Lord Jesus before God. With the Lord, we can come before God.</P><P>The universities in the old times required two years of pre-university studies. Some medical schools required three years of preparation. But to obtain salvation, there is no need to enter any pre-university. Many people think that they have to prepare themselves before they can win back God's heart. But I can tell you that there is no need to do anything to please God. There is no place in the Bible that says that God wants to be reconciled to us. The Bible only says that we need to be reconciled to God. God is reconciled to us already! God gave His Son to us because He loved us. He did not love us only after He gave His Son to us. Someone said, "It is fortunate the Lord Jesus died so that God could love us." But there is no such thing. He gave His Son to us because He loved us.</P><P>"And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet. And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar" (vv. 3-4). Lodebar is a Hebrew word which means "a place without grass." The world today is a "Lodebar"; it can never fill up man's hunger or quench man's thirst. "Lodebar" can never satisfy our heart. Brothers and sisters, do you know that we are created for God and not for ourselves? All those who have not turned back to God will never be satisfied.</P><P>You may dream about how your future will be so beautiful and restful. But after a while, you will find that the promises of the world are all unusable currencies. Time after time, the world only brings you discouragement and disappointment. Time after time, the world puts you into a dream; everything is just a mirage and a dry place without grass. O brothers and sisters, a godless life is an unsatisfied life. A life outside of God can never be satisfying. Mephibosheth, who ran away from David, was living in a place without grass. A sinner far away from God is also living in a place without grass.</P><P>What did David do when he heard that Mephibosheth was living in a place without grass? Thank and praise the Lord! "Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar" (v. 5). Fetch in the original text is "bring." Romans 3:11 says, "There is none who seeks out God." Luke 19:10 says, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost." Some people think that because we are so evil we should surely seek after God. Since we are so fallen, surely we should seek after God. But this is not how things work! If God had to wait for us to seek Him before He saved us, we would probably never be saved because we would never seek after Him. If Mephibosheth had had to seek after David, he would not have had any boldness to seek after him because his grandfather was David's enemy. He also did not have the ability to seek after David because he was lame. Mephibosheth did not seek after David, but David sent men to fetch Mephibosheth. We did not seek after God, but God sent His Son to seek us and bring us back to His presence.</P><P>On Mephibosheth's side, he dared not seek the king because his grandfather was the king's enemy. In addition, he was not able to seek the king because he was lame. We may think, "Perhaps someday I will become better, seek after God, and earnestly plead to Him to forgive my sins. Perhaps then I will be saved." But it was not Mephibosheth who sought after David, but David who fetched Mephibosheth. The Bible says God wants you, calls you, and sends men to tell you that He wants you. Romans 10:6 and 7 say, "But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, `Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down; or, `Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead." These verses tell us that no man can go to heaven to ask the Lord to die for him and that no man can go to Hades to ask the Lord to resurrect from death. The following verses say, "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart...for with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation" (vv. 8, 10). Mephibosheth did not need to make an effort. The king sent people to fetch him. If there is a man here who is not saved, it will not be because God does not save him, but because he rejects God's grace.</P><P>What did David say to Mephibosheth after he fetched him? "Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!" (2 Sam. 9:6). Here is the most pleasant music! "Mephibosheth." David did not say anything more when he saw Mephibosheth. He did not say, "Mephibosheth you are here"; he did not say, "Saul's grandson Mephibosheth"; he did not say, "Jonathan's son Mephibosheth"; he did not say, "Who are you?" "Mephibosheth." Have you ever considered, when David said, "Mephibosheth," what kind of feeling was in his heart, and what was the tone of his voice? Underneath this word was a beating heart, a heart that expressed God's heart. "Mephibosheth" shows that God does not hate man, that He wants man, and that He loves man. Every time a man calls out another man's name but does not say anything more, a third person will not understand the meaning, but the one whose name is called can understand.</P><P>I have spoken about the story of Mary the Magdalene. She thought the Lord was a gardener. When she asked the gardener where Jesus was, the Lord did not answer, "I am not the gardener," or "I did not take His body away," or "You are a woman; how can you get the body?" The Lord only said, "Mary!" As soon as she heard this very familiar voice, she said, "Rabboni!" We know that when someone calls another by name only, there must be considerable meaning behind it. On that day David saw his enemy's grandson, and he only said, "Mephibosheth." This shows that David's heart was not only without hatred, but also full of compassion.</P><P>It is a pity that Mephibosheth did not know David's heart. When he went to David, his heart might have been beating fast, and he might have been thinking, "Today I am going to see the king of Judah; maybe he will kill me." When he saw David and heard him call, "Mephibosheth," he should have known that David had only compassion and no bad intention toward him. But with a heart full of fear, he said, "Behold thy servant." He might have thought, "Formerly I was a king's grandson; now I humble myself to be a servant. Perhaps by this I will gain David's favor, and he will not kill me." I must tell you that no one can please God by relying on himself becoming a servant.</P><P>Then David testified of God's heart. He said to Mephibosheth, "Fear not: for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually" (v. 7). Brothers and sisters, everything is now ready. I do not know how many among us realize that God loves us. Perhaps someone has worked for many years and still does not know that God loves him. If we only knew that God loves us, our lives would be changed greatly.</P><P>In the nineteenth century, there was a famous literary writer who was an antagonist against Christianity. He was the chief editor of a very famous newspaper. One day he heard Mr. Moody's preaching, and he repented and believed in the Lord. Once he became saved, many people reported the story of his salvation in the newspapers of America. One day Mr. Chapman went into a town and stayed in the same hotel, in the room next to this man. Mr. Chapman knew him and asked if it were true that he was saved. He said, "I repented and believed in the Lord through hearing Mr. Moody's preaching. However, I knew about God's love when I was eighteen years old. When I was young I was a prodigal son. I left home at the age of twelve or thirteen for several years because I did not like being confined at home. At that time in my youth, I became very ill and ran out of money. I had to return home in disgrace. My father treated me very well, but I regretted going home. My father was old; his hair was white, and he was sick. Yet every day he forced himself to work to get a little bread for us to eat. There was never enough for three people to eat because the income was so low. I felt that I had made a mistake by coming back. I could no longer eat the bread which my father earned through his hard work. After my strength had increased some, I told him that I still wanted to go out. In my whole life I never saw him so sorrowful as on that day. He said, `You are not healed yet; why do you want to leave? If there is a piece of bread in this house, you will always have a share. If there is a piece of roof, you will always have a share. Why do you want to leave?' But I was determined to leave. Then he said, `My son, let me tell you: in my whole life, I have never desired to be rich. But today I wish I had a fortune because of you; I wish I could have more money saved for you so that you would not have to wander outside. Perhaps someone will help us in the future. Why do you want to go out?' However, I had to go. I could not bear to eat my father's hard-earned bread anymore. Eventually he said, `My son, may God bless you! After today I will not see you again; but perhaps I will see you again in heaven!' He escorted me out of the house. We walked for half a mile, during which neither he nor I said a word. We walked like this for one mile. He was tired and could not go forward anymore and had to bid farewell. Until that day I did not know how hard it is to leave home! He had not walked back more than two steps when he turned back and called me. With tears in his eyes, he took out a half-dollar from his pocket and gave it to me, saying, `This is for you.' I knew what this half-dollar meant. I knew all that my father had on earth was that half-dollar. I knew what was in that half-dollar. That was the first time in my life that I realized my father loved me! The weather was rainy and cold as I saw my father going home, but my heart was very warm. I was singing, `My father loves me!' From that day on I was not a prodigal son. I decided that the first thing that I would do was reduce my father's burden. If I earned a dollar, I would mail it to him because he loved me. From that day forward, I became another person. This does not mean that before that time my father did not love me. But at the time of my destitution, I realized that he loved me. One day I heard Mr. Moody preach the following words: `Everyone talks about the father's prodigal son, but today I want to talk about the prodigal son's father.' When I heard that the Father was the same as my father, I believed and received the Lord Jesus as my Savior."</P><P>O brothers and sisters, I have known this God for at least eleven years. Although this is not very long, I know the kind of heart that He has. Do not suppose that you can do something to turn God's heart or please Him. He loves you and wants you to be saved. He does not need you to turn His heart. Many people say, "God does not tell me that He loves me." But please take a look at the cross, and you will know that He has already loved you. You should have received the punishment of the cross, but He made the Lord Jesus suffer it for you because He loves you.</P><P>What is love? Love is not words. The deepest kind of love cannot be expressed in words. The prodigal son was prepared to say to his father, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants" (Luke 15:18-19). But when he was yet a great way off, his father had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. A father's heart shortens the distance of sin. When his father kissed him, he knew his father's heart. His father did not say, "I love you," but as soon as he kissed him, the prodigal son knew his father's heart. He could not say the words, "Make me like one of your hired servants." He could only say in his heart, "My father loves me." Please do not misunderstand God's heart. Please come to the cross. Jesus has already died for you; this should show you what is in God's heart already. When you see the blood of the Lord Jesus, you will know how much God loves you.</P><P>"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house. Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table...As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons" (2 Sam. 9:9-11). How marvelous that there is not one condition, not one commandment; there are only promises. It does not say how much one should work. Everything was given. This is grace. If we understand God's heart, we cannot but believe in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Man's Repentance</H2><P>Perhaps someone will ask, "Does a sinner not have to repent before he believes in God and is saved?" Let me tell you: do not reverse the order in the Bible. Many people think, "I must have one basic act of righteousness and one basic act of goodness before God can look favorably on me." That is law; it is not grace. Can you tell someone who feels cold to warm up a little before he comes to the fire? Or would you say, "You will be warm after coming to the fire?" One does not stop his sin and then come to believe; rather, one believes and then does not sin. Mephibosheth was afraid at first, but after being treated gracefully by David, he started to know himself, saying, "What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?" (v. 8). Romans 2:4 says, "Or...not knowing that God's kindness is leading you to repentance?" After knowing God's love, spontaneously one repents. When Mephibosheth came, he wanted to go back to the land without grass; after tasting grace, he prostrated himself on the ground and repented. Mephibosheth was wrong, so he needed to repent. David was not wrong, so he did not need to repent. We need to repent, not God. Before Mephibosheth knew of David's love to him, David already loved him; after Mephibosheth knew of his love, David still loved him. God is the same toward us. After I knew God's love, I changed my thinking and concepts. Today, is there any sinner who would say, "Would not it be good if I could please God?" Let me tell you: God loves you just the way you are. Come to God just as you are. He wants you just the way you are.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Two Feet under the Table</H2><P>Now someone may say, "That is right; we are saved by grace and not by works. God treats me in the same way that David treated Mephibosheth. But after I am saved, should not my behavior become better? Why do I still feel that I am sometimes high and sometimes low, at times good and at times bad?" In order to answer this question, please read 2 Samuel 9:13. "So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet." We were saved by grace initially, and we are also kept in this salvation by grace. Many mistakenly have a concept that they were initially saved by grace but they are kept in this salvation by work. However, there is no such thing. We should realize that the condition for salvation is the condition for preservation. We are saved by Jesus, and we are kept by Jesus to the end. Although Mephibosheth dined with the king often, his two feet still remained lame. If one foot is lame, one can still jump. But if both feet are lame, it is not only inconvenient, but also ugly. We can dine at the king's table, and both feet can still be lame. The king would not allow a lame person to dine at his table on the first day and then drive him out after a few days because his feet were still lame. There is no such thing.</P><P>Our two feet are lame, but they are under the table. We should just eat what is on the table. Why do we put our two feet, which should be under the table, onto the table? We should just pay attention to what is on the table. What God has spread out here is wonderful, rich, and sweet. We just need to eat. We should not look at ourselves. Instead, we should look at the riches God has given us. Every time we look at ourselves, we will not have peace. Our eyes are for looking outside not inside. Self-introspection is not our portion. If we keep our eyes upon the Lord, we will go from glory to glory and be transformed into His image. If we look at ourselves, we will be just like Mephibosheth with two feet lame. After we are saved, we receive a new life, and the Holy Spirit lives within us; we become entirely new. The self that comes from Adam never changes. How did a man as holy as St. Augustine feel when he was dying? He said, "Most of this world's seeds of sin are within my self." As long as we are still in this body, our two feet are still lame. We should not look at ourselves. We should only look at the riches and the grace that God has spread before us. When we do this, our hearts will be satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MEPHIBOSHETH TO DAVID<br>(2 SAMUEL 16:1-4; 19:24-30)</H2><P>A few years later, Absalom, the son of David, rebelled, and David escaped to hide from his son Absalom. "And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth" (16:1-4). Is this true? Let us read chapter nineteen and find out.</P><P>After the conspiracy, David came back to Jerusalem, and Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul, also came down to meet the king. From the day the king departed until he came again in peace, Mephibosheth did not do three things: he "had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes" (v. 24). Brothers and sisters, do you know what this means? This is what I spoke about this morning; this is a widow's heart! Mephibosheth might have said, "David, who treated me graciously, is not here anymore. Although they did not come to destroy me, my joy is gone. What is the use of decorating and beautifying myself? He is not here anymore. Who has the heart to decorate?" We know that we are not worthy of our salvation. The world rejected our Lord and nailed Him to the cross. On this earth we also have a widow's heart. The reason we can reject the world and not love it is because the person whom we love is not here anymore, not because the world is not lovable. The only thing He got from the world was a grave. This is why we cannot love the world. The world is a place which is contrary to us.</P><P>Mephibosheth's heart was a widow's heart. Since the king was not there, he lost his heart for everything. A very deep believer once said, "Wherever Jesus is, there is heaven. If Jesus is in hell, then hell is heaven too. If Jesus is not in heaven, then it is not heaven." At that time I thought that there could not be such a thing. But today I want to say that this is true. In the beginning all we thought about was the problem of sins, but now all we think about is the Lord Jesus. Formerly our thoughts were on being delivered from the punishment of hell, but now we think about the Lord Himself. Therefore, if the Lord is in heaven, heaven is lovely, but if the Lord is in hell, even hell will be lovely.</P><P>This world is nothing but a wilderness. What is a wilderness? It is desolation. This does not mean that the beauty, art, and natural scenery of the world are not good. But all these mean nothing to us anymore because He is not here. How can we love the world when it looks down on the Lord Jesus? I have said before that wherever our lover is, there is the land of joy. The house, clothes, food, and drink may be the same, but if our beloved is not there, all of these things will seem different. My hometown is Foochow. I have often thought about going back to it. However, it is not Foochow that I miss, but the brothers and sisters who are of the same mind there. They suffered difficulties and poverty together with me, and they also were opposed by other people. I could forget Foochow easily if they were not there. The same is true with the world. We cannot find rest and happiness in this world. The only attitude we should have toward the world is that of a widow.</P><P>When Mephibosheth came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth? And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame. And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes. For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?" (vv. 25-28). Here we see that he did not mention anything about the bread and wine. He only mentioned that he was deceived. His heart felt that it was sufficient that the king had returned peacefully; it really did not matter that much about being slandered.</P><P>If a person wants to express his heart, he does not necessarily have to use words. If someone has become a slave of the Lord's love, he will not be able to express his heart with words. The deeper the love, the more secretive it becomes. If you really love the Lord, you will still keep yourself pure when others are opposing Him. On the day we meet the Lord, we will not tell Him, "Lord, such have I given up for You on earth." On that day you will not say anything about yourself. You will say, "I regret that while living on earth, I did not love You more deeply and did not serve You more faithfully." At that time you will feel that even if you have a million words to offer to the Lord, it would still not be enough.</P><P>Mephibosheth did not say anything else, other than of his being deceived by his servant. There was only one thing in his heart: it is good enough that David my king has returned; being slandered does not mean that much. As long as I can sit at David's table, that is good enough. I do not need to say anything more about being slandered, nor do I need to vindicate myself. As long as the king has returned, that is enough.</P><P>"And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land. And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house" (vv. 29-30). Every time when I read this word of Mephibosheth, I say, Amen! If the King can come back in peace, what does it matter if I gain or lose? If my Lord has gained something, even if I lose something, what does it matter? All that matters is whether He is safe or not; it does not matter if the things He gives still exist.</P><P>Job said, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (Job 13:15). One martyred saint said on the night before he was going to be executed, "God, if You do not come in and interfere, tomorrow I will go blindly just as I am, come heaven or hell." This was a hero of faith. The Lord will not wrong us. But even if He ill-treats us, we should delight in His ill-treatment. As long as He is pleased, and as long as it is according to His heart's desire, we will feel sweet even when we are ill-treated.</P><P>Of course, the way David handled Mephibosheth was wrong, but our Lord will not do so to us. By being wronged, Mephibosheth's heart was clearly revealed. "Let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house." The Lord wants to save us to the extent that we care only for the Lord's gain or loss and not for our gain or loss. God's gain or loss is what matters. Our own gain or loss matters nothing. Once I needed to obey the Lord, yet I could not do it. Finally, I had to tell the Lord, "Do not give in, please allow me to give in." We ought to give in, not God. The One who once captured my heart has captured it forever. Since my heart had been captured by Him, all that I have is His. Brothers and sisters, what is our hope and expectation before the Lord? Are we still making plans for ourselves, or are we for Him? From now on may we regard all that we have as His and only care about His gain or loss. As long as He gains something, that is good enough.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DAVID SPARING MEPHIBOSHETH<br>(2 SAMUEL 21:7)</H2><P>Second Samuel 21:7 says, "But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the Lord's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul." There was a famine in the days of David for three consecutive years because of Saul and his bloody house slaying the Gibeonites. By the Gibeonites' request, in order to make the atonement, seven of Saul's descendants had to be delivered to them. This should have been the end of Mephibosheth because the first one who should have been delivered was Mephibosheth. But David cared for him and took seven men from the other tribes. Therefore, Mephibosheth was spared until the end of his life. This story tells us that every saved person will not perish. David took care of Mephibosheth from the beginning to the end. Will God wrong us? If David could protect Mephibosheth from beginning to end, will God not keep us to the end?</P><P>John 10:28-29 says, "And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand." These two verses are very familiar to us. They show us clearly that we cannot be snatched out by anyone because of "My hand...[and] My Father's hand." The Lord Jesus' hand and the heavenly Father's hand have held us securely. Who can snatch us out of such hands? No one can. Someone might think, "It is right that none can snatch us out. But we can escape." If a Christian talks in this way, he does not know the gospel at all. If a father walks with his child's hand in his hand, what will he do when he sees danger or when he sees that the little hand is trying to escape? Will he let the hand go, or will he hold it tighter?</P><P>There was a black lady in the United States who, after she was saved, sang happily, "Once saved, forever saved." A half-believing Christian asked her, "This is what you sing. But can you guarantee that you will go to heaven?" She then recited John 10:28-29 to him. He said, "That is right. But you had better not be so sure. You should know that the bigger the hand, the larger the hole through which you can fall." She answered, "No, I will never be leaked out because I am God's little finger!" She knew the Bible. She spoke the truth, because the Lord is the Head, and we are His Body. We are joined to Him in life. If a Christian perishes, the Body of Christ will have a defect forever and will never be complete. May every Christian say to the Lord, "Hallelujah! Since I have been saved, I will be saved forever. Therefore, I will give my all to You."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT</H2><P>All issues of this magazine prior to Issue No. 28 have been entirely distributed.

He felt pain when He suffered; He felt sorrow when He was misunderstood. He experienced a great deal of suffering and encountered many persecutions. When He experienced these temptations, He had the same feelings as we do. Therefore, He can sympathize with our weaknesses.</P><P>The Lord sympathized with man's weaknesses, but He never sympathized with sin. The Lord Jesus was tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin. He never said, "I sympathize with your sins; therefore, I forgive you." He sympathized with the weakness of man's flesh. What is the weakness of the flesh? It is the weakness in our soul. He sympathizes with this kind of weakness. When we suffer in the flesh, our soul feels uncomfortable. The Lord can sympathize with this kind of discomfort.</P><P>For the Lord to express sympathy means that He feels what we feel. Do we ever feel what others feel? Have we ever sympathized with others? Many times we can help others, but not have sympathy for them. We do not feel others' sufferings. When we see them in want, we can render them material help. But we have never felt the suffering in their life. When we see a sick person, we can give him food and clothing and serve him. But we may not feel his pain. Outwardly, there may be the grace, but inwardly, there is no sympathy. This means that we do not feel what he feels.</P><P>The Lord is the Lord of grace; He is also the Lord of sympathy. The Bible has two titles for the Lord: the sinners' Savior and the sinners' Friend (Matt. 11:19). The title Savior speaks of His redemption of sinners, and the title Friend speaks of His communication with sinners. He can feel all the pain and sufferings of sinners. Thank and praise the Lord. The Lord Jesus is not only the sinners' Savior, but also the sinners' Friend! Here we see a little of the riches of His glory. Sometimes we may encounter difficulties. Sometimes we may be lonely. Many people may give us a bad face; many voices may cause us sorrow. Everything around us may seem gray. But we have to know that when the billows roll over us, the Lord is not just our Savior; He is also our Friend! He feels the suffering that we feel. He sympathizes with us and goes through our experiences together with us.</P><P>Sympathy was a characteristic of the Lord when He was on earth. The Bible records many examples of the Lord sympathizing with men. He sympathized with the sick and healed them. He sympathized with the hungry and fed the five thousand and the four thousand with the loaves. He heard the cry, "Son of David, have mercy on me," and He healed the blind. When He saw the grief of those whose relative had died, He resurrected the dead. If our hearts are open, we will see the Lord's sympathy poured out upon us. Before He was the sinners' Savior, He was the sinners' Friend. We know that our Lord came to the earth to die. If it were us, we would have thought that since our mission was to die, all we would have to do is go through our ordained death. We would not worry about anything else. But our Lord was not like this. Although the cross was in front of Him, before His time had come, while He was on His way to death, He sympathized with those whom He met and who had need of Him. Oh what a loving Lord He is!</P><P>If anyone wants to sympathize with others, three things are indispensable: the first is experience. In order to sympathize with others, one must first have the experience. If you are in sound health and have never been sick, you will not be able to sympathize with sick patients. If you have never experienced a toothache, you cannot sympathize with those who suffer from a toothache. If you have never had a headache, you cannot feel the pain of those who suffer from headaches. If you have never experienced a certain suffering, you cannot share the feelings of those who experience such suffering. Therefore, you cannot sympathize with them. Experience is necessary; it helps one to sympathize with others.</P><P>A sister once said, "I have many things which are hard to overcome and many things in which I have failed. Eventually, I sought help from those believers who were better than I. But they did not understand my problem. It seems that they were born `holy persons,' and they had never felt the annoyance of failures." This shows that a person without experience cannot sympathize with others. Why did our Lord not descend from heaven as a grown-up? Why did He have to come through a virgin's womb? Why did He have to be nursed, nurtured, and grow gradually? Why did He have to pass through thirty-three years of suffering on this earth? Why was He not crucified three days after He was born on the earth to accomplish His work of redemption? Oh, the reason He was willing to submit to all kinds of limitation and suffer every affliction was that He wanted to sympathize with us. He learned the principles of human living. He was misunderstood and persecuted. He was stripped, mistreated, and forsaken by people. Eventually, He was crucified on the cross. He endured all these sufferings in order to experience the bitter taste of human life and sympathize with man's weaknesses. His thirty-three years of human living and His preaching during the three years were not only to accomplish His mission and work, but also for the sake of sympathizing with us. He had to do this before He could sympathize with our weaknesses. If there is a broken or wounded heart here today, the Lord is right now feeling what you feel. He knows your afflictions. Not only does He have the grace to save you, but He has a heart that sympathizes with you and feels your feelings.</P><P>In order to sympathize with others, experience is not enough. The second thing one needs is love. Some people suffer illness for many years; they are sick every three days and rest every two days. They have tasted the bitterness of their illness, but they still cannot sympathize with the sick patients in the world. They can only sympathize with those they love. They have the experience, but they do not necessarily have love. Consequently, they cannot sympathize with everyone. The Lord was able to sympathize with everyone while He was on the earth because He not only had the experience, but He also had the love. Once when the Lord came down from a mountain, a leper worshipped Him and said, "If You are willing, You can cleanse me." Immediately, the Lord touched him with His hand and said, "I am willing; be cleansed!" (Matt. 8:1-3). There was a place in His heart for the leper. He could feel the suffering of the leper. Therefore, He touched him. The Lord did not merely have the experience; He also had a heart full of love.</P><P>Experience and love alone are not enough. The third thing you need is to not be occupied with your own affairs. This means that nothing occupies you beforehand. Many times a man's heart is occupied with something already; therefore, his heart is closed. As a result, he cannot sympathize with others. He may say, "I cannot even bear my own burden. How can I sympathize with others?" When the Lord was on the earth, He bore a particular characteristic: He put aside His own needs. What our Lord did not do is more marvelous and meaningful than what He did. When He was hungry, He did not turn the stones into bread. When He was taken by the enemy, He did not ask the Father to protect Him with twelve legions of angels. His heart was not occupied with His own affairs. He was never preoccupied with His own affairs so that He could not sympathize with others. Many times when we have our own burdens and sufferings, we have no heart for the sufferings of others. But this was not the Lord's way. If He had been only concerned with the suffering He was about to experience on the cross, He would have been occupied with His own suffering every day. He would not have been able to sympathize with others. If He had thought all the time about His suffering-how it was the greatest and hardest of all sufferings-He would not have been able to care for and help others. But the Lord lived as if nothing was going to happen. When He met the sick, He healed them. When He met the poor, He preached the gospel to them. He acted as if nothing was going to happen. He was fully sympathetic towards others. Every time He sympathized with others, His heart was like a piece of clean paper on which any letter or drawing could be inscribed. Praise and thank the Lord that His heart was empty and wholly reserved for others.</P><P>He not only sympathized with the people of that time, He also sympathizes with us today. He is our High Priest, and today He sympathizes with us in heaven. What He experienced was a thousand times harder than what we experience. We can trust in Him and pray to Him. Whatever difficulty we have, He joins Himself to our feelings. He is gracious to us, and He helps us. He will bring us peace. Hebrews 4:16 says, "Come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help." Many times we feel that others do not consider our problems to be important and that no one can sympathize with us, comfort us, or help us. At these times, we surely feel how heavy our burden is and how much our suffering is. But there is One in heaven who sympathizes with us. We can come boldly to the throne of grace to beseech Him. In heaven, there is One who sympathizes with us and has mercy on us; He feels our burden. He will make our burden light. At times, friends on earth may lighten our burden, but this Friend in heaven is always ready to bear our burden. He not only bears our burden in feeling, but in reality as well. He sympathizes with us, and He is gracious to us. It is as though we are the only ones He loves. He is only concerned about our affairs. He is such a Lord! Thank and praise God! We have such a Lord!</P><P>Finally, I would like to add a few words. Since the Lord sympathizes with us, and He personally feels what we feel, He will never burden us with more than we can bear. We should remember that He is with us in every position in our life and is joined to us in our feelings; He will give grace to us. He is deeply touched by our every problem and understands every drop of our tears. No matter how much we suffer, He feels the same suffering. Let us trust Him and receive rest from Him. He is willing to sympathize with us and express compassion to us. Although He is not here today, His heart is still reserved for us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>NARRATION OF THE PAST</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 33</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Acts 14:26-27</H1><P>This morning, we would like to follow the example of the apostles in a small, insignificant, and humble way to speak about what God's grace has done through us. Therefore, we will not speak about any doctrine today. Instead, we will relate some stories. A few days ago, we read the News Magazine, Issue No. 1517, page 7, which had an article on church news. The title of the article was "Conference of Western and Chinese Believers of the Little Flock." It mentions something concerning myself and the conference we had. The writer of this article was very polite, and he did not seem to have an evil intention towards us. However, what was reported, perhaps collected from interviews, was somewhat inaccurate in some of the facts. From his words we know that the writer is a brother. So within the next week, I will write a letter to him to inform him of some corrections. (At the time of the printing of this magazine, the letter has been sent, but I have not seen it published yet.)</P><P>The reason I want to speak about our past is that I hope the brothers and sisters among us today will not be robbed to follow others in calling ourselves the "Little Flock." Those brothers and sisters among us who are somewhat familiar with our history will, of course, not be affected. But because some brothers and sisters have only been with us for a few months and do not know our past history, I am afraid that some of them will be a little confused. This is why I want to take this opportunity to speak to all of you.</P><P>Many brothers and sisters are not clear about our background, our work, and everything about us. Many people do not know our history; therefore, I have to say something.</P><P>Three years ago I had to go back to Foochow because of my health. Some brothers and sisters at that time wanted me to tell them something concerning the work between 1922 and 1923. They asked how it was at the beginning, how we fought the battles, and what the testimony of the truth was. I will take this opportunity to speak about how the Lord showed us the truth and how He led us on in this way. Hopefully, this will make them (the Foochow brothers) and the brothers and sisters here (in Shanghai) more clear. We have to pay attention to our words and attitude in order to prevent others from calling us the "Little Flock." If we have already considered ourselves the "Little Flock," we cannot, of course, blame others for calling us the "Little Flock." By relating the story of our past, perhaps we can avoid much misunderstanding.</P><P>However, it is difficult to speak about the things of the past. First, many battles were fought in many areas at the beginning. If we mention names, it will hurt others. Second, many of the past events have to do with me personally. Third, anytime anyone speaks about the past, there is always the subjective influence of his background. For example, if we ask a brother from Nanking to say something, he will surely speak about God's leading, and how he has been taking this way in Nanking. If we ask a brother from Amoy to speak, he will surely speak about the way he sought after the Lord in Amoy and how he obeyed God to take this way. Therefore, whenever people speak about past events, personal flavors and personal backgrounds unavoidably come in. This is what I would like to avoid. I would like to reduce my personal flavor to a minimum. The name Watchman Nee should be cursed. I have said this before, and I will say it again today. I hope that personal flavor would be reduced to a minimum. At the same time, I would like to tell everyone our history. I will now read to you the article in News Magazine:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The origin of this congregation began with a Fukienese believer called Nee To-sheng. Around 1922 to 1923, he came to Shanghai to establish his congregation and propagate his teaching. He based his principle strictly on the original text of the Bible, but was not well received by the Shanghai community. Because of the political turmoil, he was not able to establish anything, and subsequently returned to Fukien. Later he started The Christian magazine, which became very popular and widely circulated. Later, the magazine changed its name to The Present Testimony, which was also quite appealing and widely circulated. At the same time, he returned to Shanghai and gathered his few affiliates, purportedly to pray, while substantively expounding the Bible. Three years ago, they set up their meeting place in Wen-teh Lane of Hardoon Road in West Shanghai. At the beginning the number was not big, and they called themselves the "Little Flock." They meet about ten times every week. During the past three years, over ten Presbyterian congregations in Kiangsu, another ten or more China Inland Mission congregations in Chekiang, a few independent congregations in Yun- chia and Pingyang in Chekiang, plus a few other congregations in Fukien who were of the same mind were all affected by him. They all overthrew their original denominational names and changed the pastoral system to come under the banner of the "Little Flock." This season, as a result of a visit by six men from Australia, including a Dr. Powell, a missionary Mr. House, businessmen Mr. Joyce and Mr. Phillip, and two female believers who arrived from London, there was a gathering of the affiliates from Kiangsu, Chekiang, Fukien, and Shanghai. The attendance was about two hundred, with Wen-teh Lane hosting. The meetings lasted from November 7th to the evening of the 13th. Every day there were three meetings. I was able to attend the meetings as an observer. Every day Mr. Nee was the main speaker, while the Western and the Chinese believers engaged in discussions. A Mr. Chang and Mr. Chao were the translators. The morale was rich and sweet, and one came away with much help.</P><P>This report is well-intentioned. But as far as the facts are concerned, it is mostly inaccurate. This is why I have to relate to you the real facts so that you will know God's leading among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONING</H2><P>I was saved in the spring of 1920. During the first year following my conversion, I was unclear regarding the truths of the church, except that the sister who led me to the Lord had told me that unfortunately there were too many nominal Christians in the church today. Also, I felt the character of the pastors I knew was too poor, for one did not ordinarily see them except when they came to ask for donations. Before my family was revived we frequently had several mahjong games going on at home. When the pastor would come for donations, we conveniently handed him money from the mahjong table. Although he knew quite well where the money came from, he still accepted it. From this observation, I felt the character of the pastors was very poor, for as long as they had money all was well. Besides this, it seemed that so many members in the church were merely nominal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTIZED</H2><P>In March 1921 the Lord showed me the truth of baptism. I saw that baptism by sprinkling as practiced by the denominations was not scriptural. As I studied the Bible in those weeks, I found that when the Lord Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River, He came up out of the water. In the denominations, however, when a person was baptized, a small bowl was used to contain the water. How then could one come up out of the water? When I was young, I was baptized by a bishop of the Methodist Church. He sprinkled cold water on my head and pressed it down with his two big hands. I became impatient and cried, wishing he would get it over with quickly. After being sprinkled, I received a certificate of baptism, which bore my name and the bishop's signature. This certificate I considered absolutely meaningless. If I had not come to believe in the Lord, even though I had that certificate, I would still dare to do anything. Fortunately, I was later saved and my life was changed. My mother had arranged for me to be sprinkled before I had believed in the Lord. About a year after I was saved, I realized that the baptism I had received was wrong and that according to the Scriptures baptism should be by immersion.</P><P>On the morning of March 28, 1921, my mother asked, "If I were to be baptized by immersion, how would you feel?" I replied, "That is just what I have been waiting for." She asked, "Where can we go to be baptized by immersion?" I answered, "I inquired about it quite some time ago. We can go to Mawei (which is two hours away from Foochow by small steamer) and find out from Miss Barber. When Dora Yu came to Fukien, she was baptized by immersion at Miss Barber's place." We felt that rather than choose a date, it was better to do it that same day. So my mother and I decided to depart that very same day. Upon arriving at Miss Barber's, we told her of our intention and she fully agreed. Thus, on the same day we went hurriedly to the countryside of Yangchi and were immersed there.</P><P>When I was baptized by immersion, I experienced a great turn in my life. The first thing I did was tell my friend Leland Wang. I came to know him during the first year after my salvation through a Bible study class held in our home. Since most of the attendants were elderly folk, and I was a young kid, I was unable to find anyone my age to talk to. Two or three weeks later, Brother Wang came. Since he was closer to my age, I began to communicate with him. So on the following day after being baptized by immersion, I went and told him, "I went to Yangchi yesterday and was immersed there." He said, "Very good, very good. Formerly, I was also baptized by sprinkling in Nanking, but later in Amoy I met a brother who told me the truth concerning baptism. Due to this further light I was baptized by immersion in Kulangsu." We were quite happy because we had both seen the same light.</P><P>The second thing I did was tell the old pastor who led our Bible study. In Foochow he was the most advanced in knowing the Bible. I especially desired to tell him because he had taught us that we should do everything according to the Scriptures. However, though I was quite excited when I told him, his attitude was quite cold. So I asked, "Is baptism by immersion scriptural or not?" He replied, "Yes, it is scriptural, but do not be so legal." I thought this was peculiar. Having taught us the Bible for a year, he continually said that as long as it is the teaching of the Scriptures, it should be followed. Since baptism by immersion was scriptural, why did he say, "Do not be so legal?" I had obeyed the truth, yet he said, "Do not be so legal." I realized then that in his teaching there was compromise. If concerning this matter he would say do not be so legal, it was unlikely he would be bold to say that any other truth concerning the church should be obeyed. From that point on, I began to have doubts regarding the truths of the church which he taught. I also realized that I must put man's authority aside, and I determined that from then on I would carefully study the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BREAKING BREAD</H2><P>In this same year (1921) I went to the Bible regarding a number of questions. I said to myself, "There are so many nominal Christians in the present day church, yet the Bible says that only the saved ones are in the church. There are so many denominations today, yet there is no Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church, or any other denomination in the Bible. Why then am I a member of the Methodist Church? Since God's Word is not saying it, why am I doing it?" The Methodist bishop was a good friend of our family. Being a personal friend of the bishop was one thing, but the fact that denominations are unscriptural was another thing. I saw that the system of pastors was not scriptural and that meetings should be practiced according to scriptural principles. In the beginning the light I had on these matters was small. I was like the blind man in Mark 8 who, although he could see men, could only see them as trees walking. I had seen a little, but I did not see clearly.</P><P>One afternoon in the first half of 1922, I was much troubled concerning the matter of the breaking of bread. I had seen from the Bible that believers should often come together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord. For this reason I said to myself, "Why is it that in the church today the breaking of bread is held only four times a year?" Besides, among the ones who came to break bread, some were regular movie-goers, some were habitual mahjong players, some even questioned whether or not the Lord Jesus could be considered a good man, and some were evidently not even children of God. When I saw such people going to receive Holy Communion, I began to consider whether or not I could go. No! I could not go. Following my salvation, up to 1922, I had never been to receive the so-called Holy Communion. For many days I searched the Bible concerning this matter of breaking bread. Was a pastor required to preside over it? Was it true that only those who had received ordination could break it, while those who had not received ordination could not? I spent much time studying but found nothing like this in the Scriptures. This matter of a pastor presiding over the breaking of bread was not in the Bible. At this point I was very troubled. Though I wished so and though the Bible said that we should often break bread in remembrance of the Lord, I had no such place to break bread.</P><P>One Thursday afternoon following the Bible study, I sought out my friend, Leland Wang, for a little talk. I shared my feeling that according to the Bible we should break bread often in remembrance of the Lord, but that I had not done it once since being saved. I also mentioned that there were some in the denominations who are clearly not the children of God and with whom I could not break bread, and that there was the further problem that according to them no one could break bread except the pastor. I told him, "Neither you nor I are pastors; so even if we gathered all the true believers together, we would be considered unqualified to break bread. Isn't this puzzling?" Brother Wang took my hands and said, "God has been leading me exactly the same way. Last night I could not sleep, but was continually praying and searching concerning this very matter of whether or not believers should break bread, and whether or not it is necessary for a pastor to preside over it. I realized from my prayer and searching that in no place does it say that only ordained pastors can break bread." When I heard this, I thanked the Lord because He had been leading us in the same way. Since we had clearly seen the principles of meeting in the Bible, I said, "No day is better to begin than today; let us begin breaking bread on the coming Lord's Day."</P><P>Since we were settled on the time to begin, we began to discuss the place. Our house was larger, but I had not told my mother how I felt about this matter lest she think that we young people were rebelling. Leland Wang was living in a house borrowed from a girls' school and was moving soon, so he felt it would not be too convenient. I said, "It does not matter; let us meet at your place." After we had made that decision, I was exceedingly happy on Friday and Saturday, for I was anticipating the happy day which was soon coming. When the evening of the Lord's Day came, I informed my mother that I was going to Leland Wang's home. She asked, "What for?" I replied, "To take care of something very important." That night three of us (Leland Wang, his wife, and I) met in his little house to break bread and drink the cup together. As long as I live, and even into eternity, I will remember that experience. I was never so close to the heavens as on that night! That night the heavens came near to the earth! All three of us could not help but weep! On that day we knew what it meant to break bread in remembrance of the Lord. As a young boy, after being sprinkled, I had partaken of the Holy Communion. My response at that time was, "The bread is rather sour and the grape juice is rather sweet." I understood nothing regarding the significance of breaking bread; I only realized that the bread was sour and the juice was sweet. But when the three of us broke bread that night in Leland Wang's home, I knew that this was a most precious matter to God. On that first occasion we learned what it meant to worship and remember the Lord. We could do nothing but give praise and thanks to Him.</P><P>After the first meeting we asked ourselves, What about the next meeting? Some denominations observed the breaking of bread every three months, but what about us? The Bible tells us to remember the Lord often. We felt from reading Acts 2, that at that time the breaking of bread was probably a daily matter. Acts 20:7 says, "And on the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread." This is very clear. On the basis of the word, therefore, we decided to observe the breaking of bread on every Lord's Day. From that time on, except when I was ill, traveling on the road, or prevented by some unexpected event, I always broke bread every Lord's Day. Shortly afterward my mother discovered what we were doing. She did not object; she only commented that we were too bold. Several months later, she also joined us in breaking bread.</P><P>Gradually the way the Lord was taking us began to have its outside effects. There was talk that several members of the Nee family were baptized by immersion. The district superintendent of the Methodist Church came to inquire of us concerning this matter. I said, "The only question is whether or not baptism by immersion is scriptural. If it is not scriptural, I am willing to stand before the congregation and confess my error; if it is scriptural, then I must obey." He only said, "Yes, it is scriptural, but you should not be so legal." If there were no need to be legal in one matter, there was no need to be legal in any matter. It surprised me to find that while the Methodists had originally been our good friends, now because of baptism by immersion, they turned quite cold toward us. From that day on I realized what it means to obey the Lord and that there is a price to do it. I also realized that people do not ordinarily consider baptism important; however, after one was baptized in a different way, they did consider it important.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEAVING THE DENOMINATION</H2><P>During the latter half of 1922, I uncovered another problem from the Bible-the problem of denominations. Do the Scriptures say that I should be a member of the Methodist Church? In 1 Corinthians 1 Paul exhorted the Corinthian believers not to be divisive by saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ." I began to consider: Was Wesley greater than Paul? If Paul rebuked the Corinthian believers for saying, "I am of Christ," surely for you to say that you are of the Presbyterian Church, while I am of the Methodist Church, and he is of the Baptist Church, is not scriptural.</P><P>At this time I was studying in a mission school. The school sent me as a delegate to a spring retreat and required on the application form that I state in what denomination I held membership. I wrote, "I am a Christian and I belong directly to Christ." They said, "Nevertheless, you are still a member of a denomination." I replied, "No, I am simply a Christian. The Bible does not say that I should be a member of any denomination." At that time I was determined not to confess with my mouth that I belonged to the Methodist Church. Whenever I was asked concerning this matter, I always replied, "I am a Christian."</P><P>One day while reading the Bible I was pondering this problem: Could I simply leave the denomination? Shortly after this I heard someone say that a certain department store went bankrupt. The conversation went like this: Whenever several people go into a business partnership, regardless of whether or not they are personally involved in the business of the store, once the business goes bankrupt, none can escape the consequences; everyone must share the responsibility of the bankruptcy. I realized from this conversation that as a member of the Methodist Church I was in a sort of partnership. Although in reality I did not take part in the system of the Methodist Church, in name I could not escape the consequences. If I wished to follow the Lord, not only must I refrain from being a member of the Methodist Church in deeds, but also I must have my name removed from the Methodist Church. Having become clear concerning this matter, I felt it necessary to discuss it with my mother, since originally it was she who placed my name there. My mother did not immediately approve of my intention, for she feared that the Western missionaries who were considered our good friends would be offended. My feeling was that we should not be afraid of people being offended with us; rather we should be afraid of the One who is greater than men being offended with us.</P><P>One day I went by boat to Mawei to see Margaret Barber. I asked how she felt about my name being in the Methodist Church's book of life (what they called the church register). She replied, "I am afraid that among the names in that book of life many are dead and not a few are perishing." I said, "Should I have my name in a book of life on earth?" She replied, "If your name is recorded in the book of life in heaven, what good will an earthly book of life do you? And if your name is not recorded in the heavenly book of life, what will this earthly book of life profit you?"</P><P>I spoke to my mother persistently for two months regarding this matter, but still she would not agree. One day while my whole family was in the garden, I took the opportunity to speak to my parents. I said, "Is it scriptural to leave our name in the denomination?" They answered, "No." Again I said, "Is it our duty to obey the Bible?" "Yes," they replied. Then I pressed on, saying, "Then why do we delay and not obey the Scripture?" They replied, "Very well. Do it, do it." Immediately, I drafted a letter, and my father personally wrote out the letter. After each of us signed it, I dispatched it by registered mail. In essence, the letter said this: "We have seen that sects are unscriptural and that denominationalism is sinful. Therefore, from this day on please remove our names from your book of life. We are doing this not because of any personal animosity, but simply because we wish to obey the teaching of the Scriptures. Our decision is final, and it will not be necessary to bring it up again. We still consider ourselves your friends. Besides our desire to obey the Bible, there is no other reason for our action."</P><P>Four days after the letter was mailed, several Western missionaries came to our home. They said, "One only hears of a church excommunicating its members, never of a member excommunicating himself from a church. What is the reason for your action?" We answered, "We have already explained our reason, and there is no need to discuss it further." The following day they asked the principal of a certain school to come speak to us. We said, "We have nothing to say. We are still your friends, but we wish our names to be removed from the record." Later, our pastor, the district superintendent, and the bishop all came asking whether we had taken this action because of baptism by immersion. They explained that if members of the Methodist Church wished to be baptized by immersion, there was no problem. We replied, "The Lord led us to do what we have done. You feel there is no need to be legal; but we feel we must at all cost obey the Lord."</P><P>It is not a question of arguing with others about baptism by immersion or about leaving the denominations. The only question is whether or not men are willing to obey the Scriptures. To be baptized by immersion and to leave the denominations are not great things; they are but two items among thousands that require our obedience. The main thing in the Scripture is obedience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COMING TO SHANGHAI THE FIRST TIME</H2><P>In 1922 I came to Shanghai. At that time, I only gave a little testimony at the Shou-jin Chapel on North Szechuan Road. I did not "establish [a] congregation" or "propagate [my] teaching," nor was I "not well received by the Shanghai community."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PUBLISHING THE PRESENT TESTIMONY</H2><P>By the end of 1922 I had a burden to publish a magazine, because a number had been saved in Foochow, and the number was increasing. At that time, Brother Leland Wang was away in the Yangtze region doing evangelistic work. Only his wife and children were at home. He asked me to move into his house to help take care of the family. Daily, Sister Wang and I prayed for the magazine. I was at that time extremely pressed financially. After praying for more than a month, there was not a single dollar on hand. One morning I arose and said, "There is no need to pray -that would be a lack of faith. What I must do is start writing. God need not put the money into our hands before we begin to write! Henceforth, I will no longer pray for this matter, but will proceed with the preparation of drafts."</P><P>When everything was ready and the last word had been written, I said, "Now the money will come." Eventually, I knelt down to pray again, saying, "O God, the draft is ready for printing, but there is still no money." After praying thus, I felt wonderfully confident that God would certainly give the money. We began to praise God.</P><P>The amazing thing was that we had no more risen to our feet than there was a knock at the door. I thought someone was coming with the money. That house being Sister Wang's, I let her answer the door. To my surprise, the one who came was a wealthy yet stingy sister. "Oh, since it is she," I thought, "there could be no money." But she said to me, "I have something extremely important to see you about." "Please tell me," I replied. Then she asked, "How should a Christian donate?" I replied that we should not adopt the Old Testament way of paying tithes, but follow the word in 2 Corinthians 9:7, which says that each person should give according to the order of God. He may donate a half, a third, a tenth, or a twentieth of his income. She then asked, "Where should the donation be made?" I answered, "Do not give it to a church which opposes the Lord, nor to those who do not believe the Bible or the redemption of the Lord's shed blood. If no one contributes to them, they will not be able to carry on their preaching. Pray before each donation; then give it either to the poor or to some work, but never to any improper organization." She said, "The Lord has been speaking to me for many days concerning my excessive devotion to money. At first I could not reconcile myself to this, but now I can do so. When I was praying this morning, the Lord said to me, `There is no need for you to pray anymore. Just start giving away your money.' I was rather disconcerted, but now I am here with thirty dollars for you to use for the Lord's work." This money was just sufficient for the printing of fourteen hundred copies of The Present Testimony. Later, another person gave an additional thirty dollars, which was sufficient for the postage and incidental expenses. This is how the first issue of The Present Testimony was published.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEGINNING OF REVIVAL</H2><P>Later Brother Wang Lian-chun joined us. At that time, there were about twenty people; some had left the denominations and some had been saved. Brother Leland Wang had the intention to invite Sister Ruth Lee to come to Foochow to conduct meetings. At the beginning, I thought it was too much trouble to invite her to come from such a faraway place. Later, she was invited anyway by Mrs. Wang and by my mother.</P><P>In January 1923, Miss Lee came to Foochow, and we prepared ourselves for the meetings and gospel preaching. Before that, we were meeting in Brother Wang's sitting room. Now that we needed to hold special meetings, there was no meeting place and no chairs. Moreover, we were afraid that no one would come. As a result, we decided to meet in the pavilion of Brother Wang's house. Stools were collected from various places when needed, and we went about the neighborhood inviting people to come and listen. Because the Lord had started something, it was easy for many people to be saved.</P><P>Originally, we considered doing some work at the beginning of the Chinese New Year. But Miss Lee had some other engagements in Nanking and had to leave Foochow. We could only send her away. We also considered asking Miss M.E. Barber from Ma-kiang to come and help us. But she declined on the ground that she did not know what kind of meeting we had. I discussed with Brother Wang about whether or not to continue with our meeting. At that time, Brother Wang had a cold, and I had already sent letters to Brothers Faithful Luke and Simon Meek, who had gone home for vacation, to come back right away. We had no other way but to continue with the meetings.</P><P>Our method of inviting people was very effective: each brother wore a white vest bearing words like "You shall die" in the front and "Believe in Jesus to be saved" at the back. There were other similar slogans. With banners in our hands, we paraded everywhere, singing as we marched along the way. Those who saw us marveled. In this way, many people were brought to the meeting. We marched this way every day, and every day people came to listen to the gospel. They filled the sitting room, kitchen, and outside pavilion.</P><P>We had rented some stools for the meeting, but the rental period expired after two weeks. When the time was up, we had no money. The stools had to be returned to the owner. Must the meetings be suspended? I announced that anybody who wished to attend the meeting in the future would have to bring his own stool. That afternoon, the whole hill, Tsang Chien Hill, was the scene of people, old and young, boys and girls, carrying stools. Even the police were amazed at the sight. After every meeting, we announced that those who wanted to leave their stools behind could do so and that we would try our best to take care of them. I also mentioned that if there were any loss, we would not be responsible for them, and that those who wanted to carry them back should do so. In this way, we conducted meetings three times a day, and every time, people brought their own chairs.</P><P>Thank the Lord, through His special blessing, a few hundred people were saved. On that occasion the foundation of salvation was clearly laid down. Until this time, many believers in China were not clear about salvation. But seven or eight years since, through those meetings and the preaching of our brothers in various places, many have now come to understand it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RENTING PREMISES FOR THE MEETING</H2><P>After we had been holding meetings for about a month, some young brothers among us felt that we should have a proper place to meet in the future. But since we were short of money, it was beyond our means to do so. I went to school to talk the matter over with several brothers, that is, with brothers Faithful Luke, Simon Meek, and Wang Tze, and we agreed that we should continue our work among the students. Then for the first time I rented some premises, a place owned by a family named Ho, all the members of which had been saved. They agreed to rent the place to me for a monthly amount of only nine dollars. I then prayed with several brothers, asking God to supply the three months' rent which was needed in advance before we could move in.</P><P>Every Saturday I went to Ma-kiang, Fukien, to listen to Miss Margaret Barber's preaching. This time when I saw her, she said, "Here is twenty-seven dollars, which a friend asked me to give you for your work." This sum was exactly sufficient for three months' rent at nine dollars per month-not too much and not too little. On my return, without hesitation, I paid the three months' rent in advance. Later, we prayed again, and the Lord provided again. This was the beginning of the work in Foochow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REVIVAL OF MANY BELIEVERS</H2><P>I have never seen a revival greater than this one. At that time, there were people being saved every day. It looked as if anyone who contacted us would immediately be saved. Every morning at five o'clock, when I arrived at school, I saw people everywhere reading the Bible. There were more than one hundred of them. Before this time, reading novels had been very fashionable. But now those who wanted to read novels could only do so secretly. Instead, Bible-reading became an honorable thing to do. There were eight classes in our school, each with a prefect and a deputy prefect. It was amazing to see that the prefect of practically every class had been saved. Even all the famous athletes had been saved. Our headmaster admired us for everything we did. The only thing he lamented was our attitude towards the Anglican Church. The headmaster was a member of the Anglican Church, but we refused to belong to that denomination.</P><P>More than sixty people daily marched in procession carrying banners, and a few dozen also went around daily distributing tracts. The whole city of Foochow with about a hundred thousand people was shaken.</P><P>Many brothers were saved and immediately baptized. At this time, we began to meet according to the Scriptures. This was the way the meeting in Foochow started. Later the number of believers increased, and the work in the villages also began.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COMING TO NANKING THE FIRST TIME</H2><P>In 1924 I went to Hangchow to do some work, and I met Brother Chang Gwan-rung. At that time something happened in Foochow. Some of the co-workers had different views concerning the truth of the church. In order to avert a split, I left Foochow and settled temporarily in Mawei. (Although in recent years, Brother Leland Wang and I have taken different ways, the oneness we had at the beginning cannot be erased!) I felt that I should engage myself in some special work, and I also went to Nanking to help in the publishing of the Morning Light Magazine.</P><P>In November of 1924, because of a call, I went to visit Southeast Asia where meetings were also started. In May 1925 I returned with the aim of settling down and rented premises in Pagoda, Foochow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PUBLISHING THE CHRISTIAN</H2><P>Publication of The Present Testimony began in January 1923. It was published at irregular intervals and was discontinued in 1925. While I was staying in Lo-hsing Pagoda, I felt the need to issue a regular publication which would give more emphasis to the truths of salvation and the church and deal as well with prophecies and types. I intended this magazine (called The Christian) to be temporary in nature. In 1925 two issues were published; in 1926 ten issues were published; and in 1927 another twelve issues were published.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETINGS IN THE AMOY AREA</H2><P>In the first half of 1926, I visited Amoy, Kulangsu, Changchow, and Tungan to bear testimony, and many people were saved. In the second half of the year, I went back to these places. This time I was very tired as I had to conduct meetings, write articles, and take care of correspondence as well. I was already slightly indisposed. Originally, I was scheduled to have ten days of meetings, but on the ninth day I fell ill. Later Brother Wang Lien-chun came and resumed the work for a few more days. In the second half of 1926, not at the beginning of 1928, the work in the south of Fukien started, with meetings in Amoy, Tungan, and the neighboring districts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COMING TO NANKING THE SECOND TIME</H2><P>Some doctors said that the disease I had contracted while in Amoy was probably fatal and that I could only expect to live a few months! I was not afraid of death, but I could not help but think of what I had learned from the Lord during the many years before and the lessons I had experienced-none of which had yet been put into writing. Surely all this ought not to go with me to the grave! At the same time Miss Lee and Mr. Cheng Chi-kwei both wrote letters to me to invite me to come to Nanking for a rest. By nature I do not like to receive free hospitality from others. Therefore, when I stayed in Nanking at Mr. Cheng's house, in the midst of my sickness, I helped to proofread the Scofield correspondence course which Mr. Cheng translated. However, I only managed to finish the first four chapters and became so ill that I could not continue.</P><P>A year before I arrived in Nanking, I fellowshipped with Sister Lee concerning the truth of the church. However, since her attitude was very rigid and since she was not at all receptive, I made no further mention of it. Later she read a book on church history, saw that the origin of the denominations was not scriptural, and became somewhat clear. Eventually, I heard that she was baptized by immersion. Later she and several other sisters began holding bread-breaking meetings every Lord's Day. When I visited Nanking, naturally I attended the meeting to remember the Lord with them. Because I had spoken a few times previously in Nanking University, gaining two brothers, we accepted them at the Lord's table. This was the beginning of our work in Nanking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COMING TO SHANGHAI</H2><P>In order to devote myself to the writing of The Spiritual Man, I soon left Nanking and went to the village in the town of Tsao-chiao, Wusih. The sisters who worked there left that place because of the political situation at that time and entrusted their house to my care. In my sickness I wrote the first four sections of The Spiritual Man. In March 1927 there was military action in Nanking, and there were also armies in Tsao-Chiao. Because I was entrusted with the care of the house, I had to stay there. Fortunately, the army did not touch anything in the house. But because I heard that the condition in Nanking was unstable, and because it was impossible to communicate with brothers and sisters in other places, I left Tsao-chiao for Shanghai. Upon arriving in Shanghai, I learned that many brothers and sisters were arriving one after another from different places. Prior to my arrival in Shanghai, there were bread-breaking meetings in Sister Pearl Wang's house at Hsin's Garden. After we all arrived, our meeting place moved to Keng Ching Lane. At the same time, the Gospel Book Room moved to Shanghai from Lo-hsing Pagoda.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FIRST SPECIAL CONFERENCE</H2><P>Toward the end of 1927 we had a prayer meeting every day. The believers in and around Pingyang, north of the Yangtze River, had been helped by our written testimonies, and they began to correspond with us. Realizing that they were ready for instruction and that the believers in China had a need, we considered holding a special conference for them. In January 1928 we rented some premises at Wen-teh Lane on Hardoon Road, Shanghai, and on February 1 we started the special conference. The central theme of the messages was solely that of God's eternal purpose and the victory of Christ. We did not refer to other problems such as the truth about the church. Twenty or thirty brothers and sisters came from other places, but God illumined them and enabled them to see how they should walk along the path of life. Such problems as baptism, forsaking denominations, and other similar things were solved by themselves. In the four years since then, seven or eight hundred brothers and sisters have been saved or revived in about ten meeting places north of the Yangtze River, and over ten meetings have been raised up. In about the same number of meeting places in and around Pingyang and Taishun, some four thousand were saved or revived. All this work was done by the Lord Himself, and it did not start recently.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GENERAL SITUATION IN SHANGHAI<br>DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS</H2><P>After we moved to Wen-teh Lane in 1928, we continued to publish The Present Testimony since The Christian magazine had ceased publication. The issues of The Present Testimony published in the last five years were the new issues. Notes on Scriptural Messages did not start until 1930.</P><P>During these few years in Shanghai, our aim has been to lead people to follow the Lord Himself, the teaching of the Scriptures, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. We do not, nor should we, expect anyone to give himself to us. This is not the so-called policy of exclusion, nor should it be taken to mean that we alone consider ourselves to be right. Our only wish is to be faithful to the end. I wrote The Spiritual Man while I was ill. When I completed it, I became worse and was bedridden practically all the time. Since the earthly tent of my tabernacle seemed to be on the verge of collapse at any time, I did not have regular work during my first few years in Shanghai. In the following two years, things were actually started. Last year there was again a special conference. The main message consisted of two enormous themes: the New Testament and the Wisdom of God. At this meeting there were more brothers and sisters from other places.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HAVING NO SPECIAL NAME</H2><P>The reason why we as well as many other brothers and sisters left the denominations is that denominationalism is a sin. We have no other name except the name of Christ. Some have called us the "Little Flock." But this is a name given to us by those who do not know us. The words "Little Flock" were printed on a temporary hymn book which we use. In 1927 because we felt the need for a hymnal, we prepared twenty hymns of praise. Later we selected or wrote one hundred sixty-four more hymns. We hope to publish a proper hymn book when we have three hundred hymns. This is why in the preface of our temporary edition, we have the words: "As to the reason for the preparation of this hymnal, its name and meaning...as well as its features, we will explain in detail when the final edition is printed." Actually, the words "little flock" are used only once in the New Testament, in Luke 12:32. The Lord used these words in reference to the whole church. To the Lord, the whole church is a little flock on earth. This little flock includes all true believers past and present; it includes all genuinely saved Christians. The Lord said clearly in John 10:16 that He has only one flock, under one Shepherd. Therefore, the "Little Flock" hymnal means the hymnal used in the church meetings, and it has no other connotation. The outsiders are not aware of this; therefore, they call us the "Little Flock." It is probably a misunderstanding that came from the name of this hymn book. Actually, all believers are part of this little flock. Therefore, this "Little Flock" hymnal is prepared for all of God's children. I hope that after this explanation, no one would call us by that name anymore. (Formerly, because I started The Christian magazine, some called us "The Christian Assembly.")</P><P>Brothers and sisters, the reason we do not want any name is that it is enough to have the name of Christ. The whole question rests on whether or not Christ's name is enough to satisfy our heart! What is the meaning of the name "Christian"? It means that we are those who belong to Christ. When a girl is married, she becomes the wife of a certain person. Can she take another man's name besides her husband's name? If she does that, what kind of a woman would we consider her to be? Therefore, if we take another name besides the name of Christ, we are like a woman having two husbands. The Lord hates this. Other than being a Christian, we cannot be a Presbyterian, a Wesleyan, a Lutheran, or a person of any denomination. We cannot divide God's children according to state churches, nor can we divide God's children according to any private churches. We do not want to have a part in anything that divides God's children, whether it be a famous man (such as Luther or Wesley) or a ritual (such as baptism) or a system (such as congregationalism) or an organization (such as the Salvation Army). As long as it is a denomination, whether it be an old one or a new one, we have to depart from it. I have said this before, and I will say it again: we are leaving the denominations; we are not leaving the church. We must be clear about this.</P><P>Moreover, we are not arguing about the way to be baptized, the way to break the bread, etc. We are fighting for what the Bible says. If it is God's Word, we should follow it. If the tradition of the elders has authority, the word of the Lord should have more authority. Which one is more reliable, the decision of the elders or the decision of the Lord? In Mark the Lord clearly said, "But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men...Thus you deprive the word of God of its authority by your tradition which you have handed down" (7:7, 13). Everyone who walks according to tradition will surely put aside God's Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PASTORAL SYSTEM BEING UNSCRIPTURAL</H2><P>I am not opposed to the pastoral gift, but to the pastoral system. Why do I say that the pastoral system is wrong? The whole New Testament only mentions the pastors once, in Ephesians 4:11 [KJV]. But the pastors as they stand now are no longer true pastors. The Catholic Church places the priests in a most prominent position, while the Protestant churches place the pastors in a most prominent position. The pastoral system is not only another form of the priesthood in the Catholic Church, but also another form of the priesthood of the nation of Israel. Originally, God intended that the whole nation of Israel would be priests. But the people of Israel became fallen, and God had to appoint one tribe to replace the whole nation as priests. From that time on, the priests became a mediatory office between God and man. Man could not come to God directly, and God would not instruct man directly. A special class of people was formed to draw near to God and instruct the people. There was no more direct fellowship between God and man. This is Judaism.</P><P>What is the difference between Christianity and Judaism? "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh" (Heb. 10:19-20). In other words, when the Lord came, He annulled the mediatory priestly class. Christ has died, and the veil has been rent. Every Christian can come directly to God, and the mediatory priesthood is forever annulled. Every believer is now a priest before God because the accomplishment of Christ has unconditionally made everyone a priest (Rev. 1:6; 1 Pet. 2:5).</P><P>Does the pastoral system not bear the nature of the mediatory priesthood? Does it not change the church into a hierarchical organization? Under this system, only the pastors take care of the spiritual matters, and the laity go about their own affairs. Baptism and the breaking of bread can only be administered by the pastors; it seems as if the pastors alone have the spiritual authority. Even the elders can only manage business affairs. I am not giving the pastors a hard time. What I am opposed to is that the pastoral system has annulled the work of Christ! If the pastoral system is not removed, many believers will not be able to grow. In that case, the ordinary believers will not bear any responsibility, and the pastors will take over the meetings. But we have to realize that there is a great difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament. In the Old Testament, there was the mediatory class, but in the New Testament, there is no mediatory class. The Catholic Church annuls the accomplishment of the blood of Christ and places the priests between God and man, robbing the believers of their new position. Protestantism also returns to the Old Testament mediatory system of priesthood through the pastoral system, and the believers are robbed again of their new position. I say again: I am not against the pastors, but the pastoral system. If anyone has the pastoral gift, I do not oppose him. On the contrary, I respect him. But because it is unscriptural to make pastoring a system and to control the church through the pastors, I must oppose it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPECIAL CONFERENCE IN NOVEMBER</H2><P>How did this conference originate? In 1926 I wrote to a bookstore in England for a few books, and I told them that I desired to have their books. One older gentleman wrote back and asked me why I wanted to buy the books. I had to tell him that I bought the books because I had left the denominations. He told an old friend of his about this. Two years ago, a brother among them came to Hong Kong, and these brothers asked him to come and see me in Shanghai. When he returned, he told the others a little about us. They too had left the denominations and were meeting under the Lord's name. When they heard that some in China had also left the denominations and were meeting under the Lord's name, they were greatly surprised. Furthermore, in Christ there is no Jew or Gentile, and it is the teaching of the Scriptures that we should visit the brothers. Because of these reasons, they made the decision to send four brothers from England, America, and Australia into our midst to fellowship with us.</P><P>After they made the decision to come, we wrote to the brothers who had been fellowshipping with us in the past. One portion of the letter said, "Since they are led of the Lord to come, we should receive them in the Lord. But we ask the brothers to remember that there can never be any name that denominates us from other believers. We belong only to the Body of Christ and do not want to join any organization. Therefore, we welcome these brothers as they come, and we receive them. But this does not mean that we have joined their organization, nor does it mean that they have joined our organization. If a man is in Christ, he is `in' already, and there is no more need to be added in. If a man is not in Christ, even if he joins anything, he will not be `in.'"</P><P>When they arrived in Shanghai (eight persons in all), before and after receiving them at the Lord's Day bread-breaking meeting, we told them, as well as everyone else, the following words and announcement:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>(1) We do not have a Chinese national fellowship based on a national boundary, like the Church of Christ in China. (2) We receive these brothers as brothers; we are not receiving what they represent. This means that we receive only these believers themselves, but not the organization behind them (the so-called Brethren). (3) This mutual fellowship is not a so-called combination of the Chinese fellowship with the Western "Brethren" fellowship. We do not belong to any sect and hope to remain so all the time. We fellowship one with another as brothers with brothers, and not as certain groups of Brethren with us. (4) We will forever maintain: (a) no other special name apart from the common name of being Christians and never take the common name of Christian for our own use; (b) no other fellowship other than the common fellowship among all believers and never have another fellowship within the common fellowship of all believers. (in other words, "no party within the party and no affiliation beyond the party"); and (c) no special creed apart from the Bible; we maintain an open Bible.</P><P>The above is an explanation of the origin and history of the conference at that time. In this way we can see that we do not belong to anyone, nor does anyone belong to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FINAL WORD</H2><P>Finally, I hope that the Western missionaries in China would pay attention to preaching the gospel and leading men to the Lord. They should not set up their denominations, nor should they divide God's children into sects. Moreover, I hope that the Chinese believers would return to the Bible and not teach others the traditions of the elders.</P><P>(An announcement made at the Lord's Day meeting on December 4, 1932)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Additional Note by Watchman Nee<br>prior to the Printing of This Article</H2><P>The truth concerning church organization is not the most important truth of the Bible. The most important truth is Christ and His victory. Our emphasis is not the truth of the church, but Christ. However, among those who have the understanding, we also speak about the church because though this is not the main truth, it is nevertheless a truth of the Bible. Personally, I hope that our co-workers in all the places would pay more attention to lead others to know Christ and His victory. Except to those who are willing to obey, there is no need to mention that much about church organization. May the Lord lead us to understand "all the counsel of God" (Acts 20:27).</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TELL HIM</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 34</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 14:1-12; Mark 6:30-32</H1><P>The Lord Jesus is a person in whom men can most easily confide. He allows others to tell Him anything. The Bible records many instances in which the Lord spoke to men. But it does not record many instances of men speaking to Him. To my knowledge, there are only two passages of Scripture which talk about this. The first is in Matthew 14, where John's disciples came to tell the Lord something. The second is in Mark 6, where the Lord's own disciples came to tell Him something.</P><P>These two passages of Scripture show us two different pictures. One is a sad picture; the other is a happy picture. One picture shows us that John the Baptist's disciples realized that their teacher was dead and had come to a tragic end. What a sad thing this was! After John's disciples had buried their teacher, they came to tell Jesus about it. The other picture shows us the Lord's twelve disciples being sent to preach the gospel, heal the sick, and cast out demons. This was a happy experience, and the disciples came and told the Lord about it.</P><P>The Bible records many instances in which the Lord spoke to men. But it does not record many instances in which men came to the Lord to tell Him something. Our Lord is a Lord in whom men can confide. Men can easily tell the Lord what they want to say. Any words can be told to Him. From these two passages, we can see the Lord's sympathy for us. Many times we encounter sufferings. Many times we have joy. Many times we need someone to share our sorrow or joy, but we are unable to find someone. Sometimes when we tell others, they do not listen. If we encounter a difficult or unsolvable problem, we want to tell others, but they may think that it is an unimportant matter. It is something very important and crucial to us. But when we tell others about it, they ignore us. Sometimes we tell others about something very joyous, but they do not understand and share our joy. At other times we feel depressed, but others cannot share our depression. Sometimes others may have had similar experiences and have the ability to feel our sorrow or joy, but they do not want to share our feelings. They already have enough joy or sorrow of their own, and they are unable to bear the joy or sorrow of others. They cannot feel what we feel. Sometimes we hope to find someone to whom we can tell our sorrows and joys. It is hard enough to find someone who will listen to us. It is even harder to find someone who will sympathize with us.</P><P>Many times we think that the Lord is great. Even though our Lord is great, He does not neglect the small things. We may think that what we tell Him must also be something great, or else He will not listen. Little do we realize that our Lord never neglects the small things. There is nothing that is too small for the Lord to listen to. He is willing to listen to everything. He is willing to listen to everything concerning us. He was willing to listen to His own disciples, and He was willing to listen to John's disciples. The disciples of John had followed their teacher for a long time. One can imagine the affection there was between them and John. When their teacher was killed, how could they not be brokenhearted? The Bible does not say that they complained about Herod, nor does it say that they cried all day long. They only buried John's body and then came to tell Jesus.</P><P>Some would bury their dead and then say, "Everything with me is over. I have lost all hope. He is dead, and I have lost everything. Everything I had left with him." Yet these are the times when we should draw near to the Lord. We can tell the Lord our sorrow. He will not rebuke us as being too worldly, too affectionate, or too attached to our dead ones. He knows our emotion, and He sympathizes with our heart. Some may have never experienced the sorrow of losing their parents, wife, brothers, or relatives. Nevertheless, when they lose something, they still feel as if their "John" has died, and they are left in despair and disappointment. They feel that the sky above them is no longer blue and that everything around them has lost its ardor; they find no way out. At such times it is most unprofitable to not bury the corpse, to cry, and to be sorrowful over it all the time. They should bury the corpse, like the disciples of John did, and go and tell the Lord. We should realize that when we have a thorough talk with the Lord and pour out our heart to Him, our intimacy with the Lord is one step further, and we know Him a little more. Intimate contact with Him at these times is hundreds of times better than our ordinary fellowship with Him. By these contacts we advance in life. We should bring our problems to the Lord and tell Him about them. He can comfort us and help us. If a person has never shed tears before the Lord, if he has never shared his joy or sorrow with the Lord, and if he has never talked with the Lord about his private matters, he has never had any intimate fellowship with the Lord; he has never had any deep acquaintance with Him. We are not saying that you cannot ask others to pray for you or ask others to help you. We are saying that one can only be drawn closer to the Lord through telling Him everything.</P><P>Once John's disciples told the Lord of their sorrows, every problem dissolved. No matter what we tell Him, He will listen. No man can sympathize with everyone. But our Lord can sympathize with everyone. He is sympathetic to every one of our problems. He cares for the affairs of us all. In His heart, there seems to be no one else's affairs but ours. He bears all our sorrows. No matter how weak we are, He will sympathize with us and bear our sorrow for us. Our Lord is willing to bear all our anxieties and patient to listen to our speaking. Do not think that He will not listen. We should never be lazy in bringing our matters to Him. He is waiting for us to tell them to Him, and He is happy to listen to our speaking.</P><P>The Lord not only wants to listen to our sorrows; He wants to listen to our joys as well. We feel that it is relatively easy to mourn with those who mourn, but it is hard to rejoice with those who rejoice. Many people think that sympathizing with others means having pity on them. But having pity on someone is not sympathizing. To sympathize means that one can rejoice with those who rejoice and mourn with those who mourn. Sometimes we may see others bubbling over with joy and consider them to be too exuberant and frivolous. This means that we cannot sympathize with the joy of others. Paul said, "Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep" (Rom. 12:15). This is to sympathize with others. The Lord is willing to be sorrowful with us, and He is willing to rejoice with us.</P><P>Mark 6:30 tells us that "the apostles gathered together to Jesus and reported to Him all that they did and all that they taught." The things they did were worth rejoicing about (cf. Mark 6:7; Luke 10:17). They went to the Lord and told Him all their joys. Many people go to the Lord when they have difficulties, but how many pray when they are rejoicing? When men are in sorrow, it is natural for them to ask the Lord for help. But when they are happy, it is easy for them to forget about telling the Lord.</P><P>Mr. Charles Spurgeon once went with a friend to the countryside for a horseback ride after he became exhausted from his preaching. At one point he was elated, jumped off his horse, and invited his friend to do the same. His friend was surprised at his move and asked him what he was going to do. He said, "Since God has given us such joy, let us thank Him at this very minute." The two of them knelt down by the road and prayed. We cannot have laughter all the time, but whenever we have joy, we should tell the Lord. We should remember the Lord at the moment of joy and share our joy with Him. The Lord never rebukes us for having too much joy. He cares for our feelings in a spontaneous way. Therefore, we should not forget to tell the Lord our joy.</P><P>What did the Lord do after He heard His disciples? He said, "Come by yourselves privately to a deserted place and rest a while" (Mark 6:31). The Lord did this in order to give them some rest. Many times we go privately to a deserted place to rest because we are unhappy and depressed. With no other recourse to take, we go to a deserted place all alone to rest. But such occasions frequently make us more distraught than before we went away. Our Lord did not merely tell the disciples to go to the deserted place to rest; He told them to go with Him. The Lord's presence gave them sweet rest and renewed their strength.</P><P>Our Lord is happy to listen to our sorrows, and He is happy to listen to our joys. He is the Lord to whom we can tell everything. Since we have such a Lord, why not tell Him all the secrets of our hearts?</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MIND OF CHRIST</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 35</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:1-11</H1><P>During the past few weeks, this passage of Scripture has often been in my heart. As Christians, we should pay close attention to this portion of the Bible.</P><P>Verse 1 says, "If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions." If we look at the words of this verse, there does not seem to be anything that we can get out of it. Apparently it does not say much. But what does this verse really mean? After reading this verse, many people think that it is insignificant, but I must tell you that it has a very deep significance. If we can understand the significance of this verse, we can fulfill what is mentioned in the following verses. We may say that verse 1 is the "soil" of the succeeding verses. A seed cannot be sown in the air because the air had no ground in which the seed can be rooted. A seed has to be sown in a soil rich and deep enough to give it opportunity to grow. This verse is the soil, the nutrition, and the source of water for the next ten verses. Without this verse, it is hard for the next ten verses to be carried out.</P><P>The words "if there is...in Christ" are very important. According to Paul, if there is encouragement in Christ, then thinking the same thing, as mentioned in the next verse, could be achieved. If there is any consolation of love in Christ, then the love mentioned in the next verse can also be achieved. Furthermore, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, any tenderheartedness and compassions in Christ, then joining together in soul and thinking the one thing mentioned in the next verse can also be achieved. If there is no encouragement in Christ, we cannot think the same thing. If there is no consolation of love in Christ, we cannot have the same love. If there is no fellowship of the Spirit, and no tenderheartedness and compassions in Christ, we cannot be joined in soul or think the one thing. In short, we must have these things in Christ in order to have the result spoken of in the next verse. If we do not have these things in Christ, we cannot have the result in verse 2.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, do you have any encouragement and any consolation of love in Christ? Do you have any fellowship of Spirit, any tenderheartedness and compassions in Christ? If you do not have these things in Christ, how can you carry out what is mentioned in the subsequent verses? If you are in Christ and have encouragement, consolation of love, fellowship of the Spirit, and tenderheartedness and compassions, then it is very easy for you to think the same thing, have the same love, be joined in soul, think the one thing, and make the Lord's joy full.</P><P>Paul applies verse 1 as the source, foundation, fertilizer and nutrient. If there were no such verse, how could Paul advise the Philippian brothers and sisters to think the same thing, have the same love, be joined in soul, think the one thing, do nothing by way of selfish ambition, nor by way of vainglory, but to be lowly in mind and regard the virtues of others? How would the Philippian brothers and sisters answer him? They might say, "Sir, although these things are good, we cannot do them. Christ can do them but we do not have His strength. As long as we belong to the world, how can we accomplish this? To love those who are lovable is all right but to love those who are unlovable is hard. I have my mind and others have theirs. I have my thoughts and they have theirs. How can we be of one mind?" Therefore, Paul took care of this concern from the very beginning by telling them that all these things will become easy, "If there is...in Christ." In order to be satisfied and full, we need to be fed first. In order to be filled, we need to be fed first. In order to be strengthened, one needs to be supplied with strength first. One brother made a very good point. He said everyone exhorts others to "put out with more strength," but he would rather advise people to "put in more strength." If one does not put in strength, how  can he put out strength? This is what verse 1 means. Paul shows us that there is strength in Christ. How very important are the words "in Christ"! Because I am in Christ, I am able. Outside of Christ I am a sinner, but in Christ I am saved. Outside of Christ I am a failure, but in Christ I am an overcomer.</P><P>Verse 2 says, "Make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing." Because of the supply in verse 1, we have verse 2. Since we are "in Christ," we can do the things in verse 2. If we have taken a meal and are still hungry, we have taken our meal in vain. If we have something in Christ, we should be able to do many things.</P><P>Why do we need to "think the same thing"? Is this possible? Can we have "the same love"? Can we be "joined in soul, thinking the one thing"? While in Foochow I spoke with a brother about thinking the same thing. He said, "Does it mean that I have to change my mind to agree with yours or you have to change your mind to agree with mine? This might be easy to do with two people, but it would be hard with three people. Which of the two minds needs to be changed in order to agree with the third? It is even harder to be of one mind among four or five hundred or even one thousand. How can we think the same thing among so many minds?" According to Paul, it is easy to think the same thing. The answer is in verse 5, which says, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." This does not mean that I lay aside my mind to be one with yours or that you lay aside your mind to be one with mine, but that we receive the mind of Christ into us. Your mind is one with His, and my mind is also one with His. If every one of us is one mind with Him, even though we are many, it is easy to be likeminded. When we set out to do something, you have your tune, and I have my song; you have your decision, and I have my opinion. At that time should you submit to me or should I submit to you? One might think that you should submit to me and another might think that I should submit to you. Neither is God's way. God's way is in verse 5: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus."</P><P>Oh, what a loss to God if one brother or sister walks on the wrong path, unwilling to submit to Him! What a loss God will suffer! Being likeminded will not only make God joyful but make His joy full. Paul, in these verses, represents the Lord. God's heart and the Lord's heart can be made full of joy only when the believers are in the situation in verse 1! There are many things that can make the Lord joyful. But Christians with the same mind make Him not only joyful, but also make His joy full. To save people will make the Lord happy. To overcome will make the Lord happy too. But to be likeminded will make the Lord's joy full. We have to be likeminded to such an extent that whatever our mouth says, our hearts agree, and we practice accordingly. The words in this verse the heart. The Chinese character for the word mind has as its root the word heart. To be one is an inward and not an outward matter. God can make us one to the point that we are one not only in word but also in our heart.</P><P>The like-mindedness of some people is only in word but not in their hearts; their hearts are not one. Their attitude reveals this. People around them can tell the difference. Of course, these ones may still say with their lips that they are likeminded. This kind of like-mindedness is not what we mean. The like-mindedness that we mean is according to being "in Christ" in verse 1.</P><P>Verse 3 says, "Doing nothing by way of selfish ambition nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves." This verse is still based on the fact that one is in Christ. Therefore, one who is in Christ should not do something and should do something. What does selfish ambition mean? It means that one has his own preference. Besides Christ he has his own aim. For example, if there is a problem between two persons and you take sides with one of them, you are wrong. You must stand only on the Lord's side for the Lord's sake; otherwise, you have selfish ambition.</P><P>What kind of glory is vainglory? There is a verse in the Bible which says, "More and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory" (2 Cor 4:17). Glory has a weight; it is not floating about but it is weighty. This kind of weighty glory can only be seen by God. The obvious glory-that which is easily seen by men-is vainglory. But man cannot secure this kind of glory. He can long for it but never obtain it. Who can secure anything that is vain and floating about? All man can do is constantly long for it.</P><P>Unfortunately, sometimes arguments occur among the brothers and sisters. They are either caused by selfish ambition or by some who are seeking for vainglory. One wants to be greater than the other. Both of them insist and neither will give in. In fact whoever who wants to be great cannot really become great because there are always those who are greater!</P><P>When a person is flattered and highly praised, it seems that he has received much glory. Actually, his feet are walking in vanity and emptiness. Brothers and sisters, please remember that all glory from man is vainglory. There is a story of a renowned English novelist who wrote a very famous novel. One day he was invited to a banquet by an English lord. There he met a lady who continued to praise his novel. He rose up and said to her, "You are not worthy to praise my writing." He considered the lady's compliment as shameful. Oh, who is worthy to compliment us? Apart from the Lord, no one is worthy! Whenever someone praises us, we become degraded. Should we then covet praise? If your heart is for the future, aspiring to the Lord's word of "good and faithful servant," and if you desire the crown in that day, how can you receive and seek after someone's praises today? Moreover, no one is worthy to praise us.</P><P>We should not only shun vainglory on the negative side but, on the positive side, we should in lowliness of mind consider one another more excellent than ourselves. What is lowliness? Lowliness means to leave no ground for oneself. Whoever gives ground to himself can never be lowly. All those who say that they have some kind of authority, and that they should receive something will never be lowly. To be lowly is to leave no ground for oneself. One may speak words of lowliness with his lips, but may not be lowly in his mind. Many things that pass through the lips may not necessarily pass through the heart.</P><P>How is an attitude of lowliness of mind expressed? It is expressed through "considering one another more excellent than yourselves." Considering others more excellent than yourselves is a sign or trademark of lowliness. How difficult it is to consider others more excellent than yourselves! Once I met an elderly Christian who had served the Lord many years. A brother asked him, "Of all the Christian virtues, which is the most difficult to attain?" He replied, "The most difficult thing to attain is Philippians 2:3, which says, `in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves.'" Indeed, being lowly in mind is most difficult! What sin caused Satan to become Satan? It was pride. He fell because he wanted to be equal with the Most High. What sin caused man to become a sinner? It was also pride. Adam thought that after eating the fruit he would be like God, discerning good and evil, so he ate and fell. Lowliness of mind is the most difficult of all the virtues to attain. Perhaps no one on earth can genuinely achieve it. It is possible to find some who have ability, eloquence, or talent. But it is very difficult to find a genuinely humble person.</P><P>How can we consider others more excellent than ourselves? One believer put it well by saying, "When I look at myself, I look at my old man; when I look at others, I look at their new man." If we recognize our nature and corruption, and we consider God's grace upon others and His transformation of others, we cannot help but consider others more excellent than ourselves. The believers in Rome should have received help from Paul, but Paul wanted to receive help from them because their faith had spread abroad. Paul wanted to receive help from the recent work God had done among them.</P><P>I once brought a problem to a Western missionary. I asked, "Does God demand more from the believers, or do the believers demand more from their fellow believers? My thought was that perhaps God demanded more. I considered that because we are so low and the Lord is so high, He would demand more. She replied, "No." I asked her for the reason, and she said, "What we can see are men's obvious failures; but what the Lord sees are men's hidden victories." Indeed, this word comes from deep experiences. What we see is a person's obvious failures-once, twice or even tens of times. But the Lord sees his hidden victories-once, twice or hundreds of times. Perhaps you were tempted five times and failed five times, while someone else was tempted three times but failed only once. Perhaps he has many hidden victories which you have not yet seen. You may have had ten battles and were defeated only once; he may have had hundreds of battles and been defeated only once. If we understand this, we cannot but consider others more excellent than ourselves.</P><P>Verse 4 says, "Not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also." This is not an easy matter. Due to my bad health in recent years, I have often been unable to take care of the things of others. Oftentimes it seems that we cannot even take care of our own things. How can we then regard the virtues of others? Regarding the virtues of others requires a life of self-denial. Recently I met a lady missionary from the China Inland Mission. I asked if she had met Mr. Hudson Taylor and whether she had seen anything special about him. She said, "According to what I know, he has a special characteristic: whenever you visit him, it seems that he is not busy. He considers your matter to be the most important. Actually his day is filled with writing many letters and seeing many people. He cares for others as though he has no other cares." This is self-denial. Oh, if the Lord were as cold as we are, not caring for anyone, where would you or I be today? The Lord cared for the things of men. He died because of our sins. We must learn to be a person who cares for the things of others.</P><P>Verse 5 says, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." This verse is a conclusion of verses 1 through 4. If one seeks for encouragement in Christ, much more can be said. If we have the mind of Christ Jesus, everything will be fine with us, and we can do all things. Since some may ask, "what is the mind of Christ?", Paul gave his answer in verses 6 through 8.</P><P>Verses 6 through 7 say, "Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, But emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men." Christ was entitled to lawfully hold His existence in the form of God; He is worthy to hold this as His right. Therefore, He "did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped." He "emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men." What kind of mind is the mind of Christ? The mind of Christ involves Him giving up His legal right. Perhaps you wish that certain ones would treat you a certain way. But Christ did not even claim what He was entitled to. He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped; rather, He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave. This is the mind of Christ.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I often feel that legal rights are not a good thing because we all think that we are entitled to certain legal rights. But our Lord said, "You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them. It is not so among you" (Matt. 20:25-26). The teaching of Matthew 5 through 7 can be summarized in two phrases: give up what you deserve and, instead, receive joyfully what you do not deserve. Others can demand an eye for any eye, a tooth for a tooth, but the Lord said to pray for those who persecute you. Lay aside what you deserve and receive what you do not deserve. On these hang all the Law and the Prophets (Matt. 22:40). Whether at home or abroad, no Christian should voice his right. If the Lord had said, "Can the Father send me?", the Father could not have sent Him. On the one hand, the Lord said, "I and my Father are one." At the same time, He also said, "My Father is greater than I." Is there a difference of great and small within the Triune God? No. The matter of greatness and smallness is not based on existence but on willingness. The Father sent the Son, the Son sent the Spirit; this is the humility within the Godhead.</P><P>The form of a slave indicates the lowliness of Christ; the likeness of men indicates the human limitations suffered by the Lord. The form of a slave is in apposition to the form of God as man is in apposition to God. God is unlimited. But man is limited by time and space; he is limited in his eating, drinking, and sleeping. The form of God is glorious whereas the form of a slave is lowly. The mind of Christ is in His being willing to humble and restrict Himself.</P><P>Verse 8 says, "And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross." Christ's obedience is to obey One who is equal to Him, not One who is greater than He. Christ's obedience is an obedience even unto death, and that the death of a cross.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, Christians should be more in oneness and love. The way of verses 6 through 8 is truly the way of the cross! If a brother has not yet learned to deny the self, is still unwilling to lay down his legal right, and who does not know how to humble himself among his peers, then he has never walked the way of the cross. There was a Western missionary who said, "A certain person always encourages others to walk the way of the cross, the narrow way of the cross. However, I see him as one who has never entered into this way." Indeed, if we have never denied ourselves, we have never taken the way of the cross. We often say that we want to choose the way of the cross but we do not realize that we need to deny ourselves in daily matters that is, to die. This is the way of the cross.</P><P>Once a sister met a doctor who was an active believer in the Brethren group. He was well-educated, knowledgeable about the Bible, and quite eloquent in his preaching. This sister said to him, "Sir, what you preach is not wrong; but the way you take is wrong." He argued that what he preached was the denial of the self and the bearing of the cross. The sister said, "That is right; but what I see is that you have never died." He humbly sought for her advice, and she spoke frankly to him according to the Bible. Later he wrote her a letter, saying, "After you left, I told God that I did not know what the cross was, or what the way of the cross was, or what it was to deny oneself? I told Him, `God, in the midst of all my ignorance, I consecrate myself to You. I pray that You will enable me to deny myself.' After this, difficulties came. My wife opposed me. When I could no longer bear it, a voice reminded me, `In these matters you should deny yourself and die.' Formerly I preached about the cross and the denial of the self. Yet I did not realize in what things I should die and how to die? Now I know that it is carried out in the practical matters. When I speak in his way, many people are provoked to oppose me. My medical practice has also been affected. Now I know that I must die among those who are with me."</P><P>Brothers and sisters, many people know the truth and the necessity of denying the self, but how does one die? One dies among those he is with, among the people he can see and touch. May God bless us so that we can think the same thing, have the same love, be joined in soul, and think the one thing, so that the Lord's joy may be full.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT</H2><P>Due to the impossible postal route to the 3 Manchurian provinces, all the publications will be mailed to Darien.

It makes one feel uncomfortable when reading it and displeased when hearing it. "And inasmuch as it is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment." This is what I want to speak about today. The matter which has been reserved has two parts. The first part is that man will die. The second part is that after death there is judgment. If you can escape the first thing God has reserved-death, you can also escape the second thing God has reserved-judgment. According to God's appointment, first, everyone must die, and second, everyone must receive judgment after death. If the first appointment, death, is fulfilled, then the second appointment, judgment, will also be fulfilled. Our friends who are sitting here need not ask if they will receive judgment; they only need to ask if they will die. The topic of my message today is judgment. This is something unpleasant to your ears and something about which I do not like to speak. But we do not have a choice. Unpleasant as it is, you must hear, and I must speak. If death is real, judgment must be real. If you are bound to die, you are bound to receive judgment. If you can escape death, then you can also escape judgment.</P><P>The Bible tells us many things that are facts. If you believe them, they are facts. If you do not believe them, they are still facts. A fact is not going to change into a non-fact just because of disbelief. A fact is always a fact.</P><P>One fact which the Bible tells us about is God. It does not matter whether or not you believe there is a God; God is a fact. For example, the sun is in the sky, and whether a blind man believes in its existence or denies its existence, the sun is still a fact.</P><P>Another fact which the Bible tells us about is sin. It does not matter if a man believes or refuses to believe that there is sin; the fact of sin still remains.</P><P>The Bible not only tells us the facts about God and sin, it also tells us about death. This again is a fact. The Bible speaks about death more often than men do in their daily conversation. If you believe that death is real, it will come to you. If you do not believe that death is real, it will still come to you.</P><P>The Bible tells us another fact about the future. Many do not pay much attention to this fact because it is about the future. But this fact is as real as the three mentioned above. This fact is judgment. Judgment will occur whether you believe in the fact, or whether you do not believe in it. All kinds of sins-small or big, civilized or crude, attractive or ugly, committed by reputable people or disreputable people-are subject to judgment by God. Judgment from God is a fact. You can choose to believe or deny it; nevertheless, judgment is a fact. I have disregarded formalities to straightforwardly tell you about this. I do not need to spend time to cite evidence to prove that there is judgment. Facts do not require proof. God is there just as the Bible says He is. The Bible speaks of God at its very beginning. It never elaborates any proof as to how there is a God. Facts do not require proof. The Bible does not need to prove that you have sin because, in fact, you have sin. The Bible does not need to prove that you will die because, in fact, you will die. Likewise, the Bible does not need to prove that there will be a judgment because, in fact, there will be a judgment.</P><P>My friends, I want to ask you a question today, "Have your sins been resolved?" Perhaps you have heard the gospel a few times, yet you have not resolved the problem of your sin; and you are not yet saved. I must tell you that as certain as death is, judgment is just as certain. You cannot tell when you are going to die. Neither can you tell when you are going to receive judgment. Therefore, resolve your problem of sin today. If it is not resolved, you do not know how dangerous it is. Many people think that judgment is not that important. However, if you do not resolve your problem of sin today and do not deal with the question of judgment today, the judgment will be without mercy for you in the future. I exhort you not to take your meal or go to sleep until this problem of sin is resolved. This question is immensely important. You must deal with this matter thoroughly before God today. Otherwise, when judgment comes, it will be too late.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESULT OF JUDGMENT</H2><P>The Bible not only tells us that there will be judgment, it also tells us the result of judgment. In the future, God will judge the sins of all men in the world. He will recompense those who do not know Him and who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished by eternal perdition (2 Thes. 1:8-9) and go to hell. While the Bible tells us that God loves the world, it also tells us about the fire of hell. If we have not obtained the grace of forgiveness, this is most dangerous. The unbelievers will depart from the Lord's face and go to hell. This is eternal perdition, and no one can escape it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXCUSES AT THE TIME OF JUDGMENT</H2><P>Some may think, "When I stand before the judgment seat, I will say to God, `You cannot send me to hell because I did not understand the message I heard.'" Some sitting here today may say, "I do not understand; I am not clear; I can probably reason with God for an excuse when the time of judgment comes." However, God has already answered you long ago. Therefore, you have no excuse.</P><P>Please listen: "Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here" (Matt. 12:41). In this verse the Lord Jesus speaks of one thing, and that is judgment. Will God Himself condemn men's sins before the judgment seat in the future? God will just sit there and have the men of Nineveh rise up to condemn their sins.</P><P>Nineveh was a rather big and famous old city. All the men in that city were sinners. God sent a prophet named Jonah to announce to them that after forty days Nineveh would collapse. The men of Nineveh heard what Jonah the prophet preached. They then proclaimed a fast, put on sackcloth from the greatest of them to the least of them, and cried mightily to God. God saw their works. Knowing that they had turned from their evil way, He did not curse them, and they obtained the grace of forgiveness. The Lord quoted this case to prove that the men of Nineveh would condemn the sins of this generation.</P><P>The men of Nineveh repented at the word of Jonah. Behold, something more than Jonah is here! Men today have the words from the very mouth of the Son of God. Who has not read the Bible? Who has not read the Gospel of John? No one dares to deny that he has heard the word of God's Son. If you have never heard that the Son of God died for you, there is nothing to say. But if you have heard it, you can by no means escape the future judgment. At the time of judgment, the men of Nineveh will stand up and say, "We heard Jonah and repented; you heard the gospel of God's Son and did not repent. How can you escape this sin?"</P><P>Some may say, "It is true that Jonah went to Nineveh to preach and that the men of Nineveh had an opportunity to repent. But I am a country person; no one preaches the gospel to me at the place where I am. God may not be able to condemn the sins of a person like me." However, the Lord mentioned another incident which leaves this kind of person without an excuse.</P><P>"The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here" (Matt. 12:42). In the time of judgment, the queen of the south will rise up to answer the argument of this kind of person and condemn the sins of this generation.</P><P>This queen of the south is the queen of Sheba. Sheba is today's Ethiopia. This place is even farther south than Egypt. The queen of Sheba came to Solomon from thousands of miles away because she heard of the fame of King Solomon and how much wisdom he had. "Behold, something more than Solomon is here." Our Lord Jesus is greater than Solomon! What He spoke has more wisdom and prudence than Solomon. What He spoke has a greater and deeper effect; it affects the eternal life and the eternal perdition of men. A queen from the south was willing to come from thousands of miles away to hear the words of wisdom from King Solomon. You are just some twenty miles from town. Can you not go into town to find a gospel chapel to hear the word? Even if you are a hundred miles from town, can you not go into town to find a place to hear the word? The queen of the south can condemn your sin because she came from thousands of miles away. Why can you not go from your house? Therefore, those who are not saved will have no excuse at the time of judgment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO WAY TO ESCAPE THE TIME OF JUDGMENT</H2><P>Perhaps some may think, "Since there is judgment, I will find a way to escape." No one should be so foolish; nevertheless, I am afraid that there might be some who have this foolish thought, so I will speak a little concerning this matter. They may think, "Everyone has to die, and judgment will come afterward. I will die and go to Hades. I will hide there and not come out. Those who have been good will be resurrected unto life. Those who have been evil will be resurrected unto condemnation. As for me, I will simply choose not to be resurrected; I will hide in Hades. Would that not be all right?" But this will not work.</P><P>Please listen to God's word: "Though they dig into Sheol, / From there My hand will take them" (Amos 9:2; cf. Psa. 139:8). You think that you can escape the judgment by hiding in Hades and by closing up the mouth of Hades. However, God's hand will take you out from there. Even if you can dig into Hades, and even if you can dig so deep that you cannot go any deeper, God's hand will still take you out from there.</P><P>Another group of people, today's scientists or aviators, may think that in the day of judgment they will fly an airplane to the sky and stay in the highest place to escape judgment. However, this way will not work. Please listen: "And though they go up into heaven, / From there I will bring them down" (Amos 9:2). You may climb up, but God will bring you down. Even though it takes much effort for you to climb, it is rather easy for God to bring you down.</P><P>Some may think, "I will escape to the high mountains and the bushes. Who then can find me?" However, the Word of God says, "And though they hide at the top of Carmel, / From there I will seek them and take them" (v. 3). You may think that there are so many trees in the high mountains that if you hide there you can escape judgment. But God will search and take you out.</P><P>Some may think that since they will not be able to hide in Hades, fly to heaven, or hide in the high mountains, they will escape to the bottom of the sea. However, God's Word says, "Though they hide themselves from My sight on the floor of the sea, / There I will command the serpent, and it will bite them" (v. 3). You may hide in the bottom of the sea, but God will command the serpent to bite you, and you will have nowhere to escape.</P><P>The few conditions mentioned above are just a few pictures that God has painted for you. You may be able to escape man's hand by going to Hades, heaven, high mountains, or the bottom of the sea, but you cannot escape the hand of God. According to the Bible, there is no way to escape and no way to reason.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OTHER CONDITIONS DURING THE JUDGMENT</H2><P>"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, who have been exalted to heaven, to Hades you will be brought down. For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until today. But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you" (Matt. 11:21-24). Friends, please listen. The more you hear the gospel the better it is. Before the judgment seat in the future, you will have that much less to say. If today you still commit sins, live for the world, seek your own pleasures, and consider sinning as your career, I beg you to consider the question of judgment. You will not live forever, and you will not be exempted from judgment. Judgment is as sure and definite as death.</P><P>I told the people in Shanghai that they would become like Tyre and Sidon in the future. Tyre and Sidon were once very flourishing, but today they are just places for laying nets. Because they were filled with sins and evil, God sent fire and brimstone to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah completely. Two years ago, an American archaeologist went to Sodom to search for historical evidence. He saw that the whole land was filled with traces of sulphur. O Shanghai, what Tyre and Sidon went through was easier than what Shanghai will have to go through during the judgment days. What Sodom experienced was easier than what Shanghai will have to face. Before the Lord was born, God's Son had not died to bear our sins, and man did not know about sin and judgment. They could still have an excuse. But you have heard that God's Son has died for you. If you do not resolve the problem of your sins today, I would shed all my tears for you! If we who preach the gospel had enough tears, we would shed them all for you! The future judgment will be extremely serious. The world will pass away, and you will pass away; all the worldly pleasures will also pass away. But the judgment will not pass away.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO ESCAPE JUDGMENT</H2><P>I have to say something regarding the way for man to escape judgment. To escape judgment, we must first ask why we will be judged in the future. Because every man has sinned, every man must be judged. If you can escape sins, you can also escape judgment.</P><P>"Judgment" in the original text is the same word as "righteousness" and "condemnation." When we come across "judgment," we can change it to "condemnation." For instance, to read "after this comes judgment" (Heb. 9:27) is the same as "after this comes condemnation." Sin is a matter that no one can escape. If man had not sinned, we could tear down this meeting hall because we would not need it. I could also change my job. I am not preaching here because I have no other way to support my living. I could give up being a Christian. I could burn up this Bible, and I could have the boldness to do all kinds of things. But sin is real, and it is a solid fact that we need a Savior. I know that there is a Son of God who bore my sins, and I know that there is a Son of God who shed His blood to redeem me from sins. I know that once the problem of sin is solved, the problem of judgment will also be solved. There is a way, and there is salvation.</P><P>What way did God use to save us from sins? I have sins, and sins deserve judgment and hell. However, God's Word tells us that God's Son has died for our sins. God's Son has died for us. "God's Son"! This term is sweet to my mouth, finer than music to my ears, and poetic to my inspiration.</P><P>God's Son has come and died for me. God's Son has borne my sins and received the punishment for sins on the cross. Therefore, I am saved, and I am now free. This is the gospel! My purpose is not to bring you tidings of woe by telling you that you will die and receive judgment. I have shown you judgment first to make you aware of your need; you need a sin-bearing Savior.</P><P>Let me tell you a story: during the Civil War in the United States of America, there were two brothers. One lived in the North, and the other lived in the South. They both were drafted into the army. The South lost, and many soldiers were taken as prisoners by the North. The one who guarded the captives was the older brother. He found out that his younger brother was among the prisoners. He dared not say anything. At night, he took off his clothes and let his younger brother wear them to escape for his life. (At that time the prisoners were to be executed the following morning.) He put on his younger brother's clothes and became a prisoner for him. The next morning, the older brother was executed by a firing squad. Later someone discovered that the dead one was not the right person. They still could try to catch the younger brother. But according to the law, they had to let the younger brother go because his brother had died for him. No person can die twice. Oh! This is but a very small example of the cross.</P><P>Please do not misunderstand my words. Do not think that the Lord Jesus came to serve society, preach universal love and equality, and become a model for mankind. I have read through the New Testament at least one hundred times and have never found such a teaching in the Bible. This is not the glad tidings. These are tidings of woe that come from the devil and hell. The Bible tells us that Jesus came in order to be judged for us. We deserved death, but Jesus died for us. The Lord Jesus said on the cross, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46). God had no choice but to leave Him there because He bore our sins. He came from the heavens to make a way for us to go to the heavens. He departed from God and came to this world so that we could draw nigh to God. He suffered poverty so that we could become rich. He came to this earth so that we could be free from the earth. He came to bear sins so that we could be free from sins. He was judged for us so that every one of us who believes in Him could be exempted from judgment. Friends, when you hear the gospel, you always hear about the cross. The word cross means nothing other than the fact that the Lord Jesus has borne our judgment and suffered punishment for us.</P><P>I will tell another story. Before the United States was as flourishing as it is today, British and French immigrants lived on the East Coast of that country. Later on, people went for gold in San Francisco and started to dig out pure gold. The news spread to the East Coast, and some traveled to San Francisco to dig for gold. There was a certain couple who discussed selling their property in order to dig for gold; they hoped that by doing this they could make a fortune. Eventually, the husband went, and for over a year the wife received no letter. One day the wife received a telegram from her husband, saying, "GOLD COME." This meant that he had found gold and that she should come. The wife was extremely happy and took her son and boarded a ship headed for San Francisco. In those days transportation was not convenient, and the Panama Canal was not yet open. Neither were there any trains. Traveling from the east to the west took a long time. One day, while they were on the ship, there was a great noise. At the beginning, she thought that there were pirates on board. She locked the door, sat inside, and would not come out. Later she smelled smoke and realized that something was wrong; perhaps the ship was on fire. She opened the door and discovered that the ship was on fire. She immediately picked up her son and ran to the deck. The lifeboats were being hoisted down. But the last boat was filled with people. Usually when a ship is sinking, the women and children are the first ones to go. Since she had come out so late, everyone else was already in the boats. She begged desperately, and the sailors promised to take one more person. At that juncture there was a dilemma: was the son to live and the mother to die? Or was the mother to live and the son to die? They could not die together or survive together. Either the mother had to die, or the son had to die. Between the two of them, at least one had to die in order for the other to live. Eventually, the mother wrote down her husband's name and address and gave it to the sailors, entrusting them to send the child to her husband upon reaching safety. Then the mother said to her son, "My son! When you see your father, tell him that your mother has died for you in the fire and in the water so that you could see his face." This is a small picture of the Lord Jesus' death for us. May we hear Jesus saying to us, "Sinners, I died for you on the cross so that you can see the face of the heavenly Father. I died, and you live. Please believe sincerely."</P><P>My only purpose is to show you that death and judgment are sure. However, God loves us and has prepared a salvation for us. His Son has died for us. Friends, please accept Jesus Christ as your Savior today.</P><P>Please listen to this verse: "He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God" (John 3:18). Please pay attention to the word "condemned," which is "judged" in the original language. In other words, "He who believes into Him is not judged; but he who does not believe has been judged already." This verse is not spoken by me, but by God and the Lord Jesus.</P><P>Please listen to another verse: "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life" (John 5:24). This verse tells us that if one hears the Lord Jesus' word and believes in His Sender, (1) he has eternal life; (2) he will not come into judgment; and (3) he has passed out of death into life.</P><P>I would like to ask you whether or not you have believed in the Son of God. If you have not yet believed, please accept Him as your Savior now. I once sat beside a dying man. If you were sitting by a dying man, I do not know what you would be thinking. I was preaching at a place, and someone came to ask me to share the gospel with a doctor who was about to die. He knew a little about the church, but he was gravely ill with tuberculosis. I arrived at his place and saw him. He said, "I have heard of Jesus, but I have always rejected Him." I urged him to rest, but he said, "I am a doctor. I know the degree to which my illness has reached and that I will die. I was a military doctor and have met many different kinds of people and have committed many sins. I regret that there is now no way out. I have committed all these sins, and there is no peace in my heart. After I die, I will not be able to meet God." He kept speaking this way, but I read John 5:24 to him. When he heard these words, he realized that God desires to give man life and that as long as man would believe, he would obtain eternal life and not come into condemnation, but would pass out of death into life. When he received this word, he had peace. There was an absolute difference between the first part of the time that I had with this man and the second part. When I arrived, he was in tears; when I left, he was able to shake my hand and thank me. I know that some day in heaven I will meet him again. But friends, please do not wait until that day to believe; do not wait until your last opportunity to believe. Please say to God now, "God, right now I receive Your Son." Oh, God's Son has died for you and has borne the judgment for you. Therefore, sinners, please come.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LOVING GOD</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 37</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 22:37-38</H1><P>Several months ago, a certain Western missionary passed away in Fukien province. I once remarked that among the people I have known, she was a very deep person in the Lord. Since I am more knowledgeable about her affairs, I have considered writing a biography for her and have been collecting her lectures, articles, and essays for editing purposes. A package of her belongings arrived several days ago including a piece of paper with the following words written on it: "O God, I thank You, because You have a commandment saying you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind!" Oh! How profound this is! I do not know how many Christians would say, "God, I thank You because You have a commandment which says you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." Indeed, since we are all believers, we ought to love God. No other religion speaks of loving God like ours. Loving God is unique to Christianity.</P><P>The Bible says that he who believes in the Son has life. Believing is adequate because it does not say to believe with all your heart. He that believes will have eternal life. We are never told to believe with all our heart. However, loving God requires all our heart, all our soul, and all our mind.</P><P>This is the first commandment. No matter where it is placed, this commandment is always the first. This is also the greatest commandment. Wherever it may be, it is the greatest. Today we must praise God for commanding us to love Him.</P><P>God desires that we love Him because this profits Him. To believe in the Lord and have eternal life are for our profit. God not only wants us to believe in Him, but also to love Him. Loving God profits Him.</P><P>What kind of condition will we enjoy if we love God? We must look at several matters:</P><P>First John 2:15 says, "Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him." If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. The love of the Father is something that can be put in us or can leave us. If we let this love of the Father be placed in us, we are able to love the Father.</P><P>Many young ones cannot forsake the world. When they are stirred by others in a meeting, it seems that they will not love the world anymore. At a different time they seem to be totally inseparable from the world. We must possess something better within us in order to drop the heart that loves the world. Once there was an art exhibition. While most of the works could be appreciated from a distance, it was necessary to study one of the paintings from close-up in order to understand its meaning. This particular painting, involving a child who was oblivious to all the lovely toys on the floor surrounding him, aptly illustrates a Christian's experience. The child's attention was focused on the windowsill, and he had up-lifted eyes and outstretched arms. The scene was perplexing from a distance, yet after careful observation, one could see a beautiful dove on the windowsill. The caption explained that in order to have the little dove, the child dropped all the toys on the floor. The moral of the painting was that one only discards the second best for the very best. God never demands that we throw anything away. He only places what is better in front of us. In order to obtain it, we will spontaneously forsake many other things.</P><P>A young believer who lived with me for two months once told me that he could not forsake the world. He told an old believer, "You can sacrifice because you have tasted all that this world has to offer. But I cannot." This young man knew about believing in God, but not about loving God. While believing in God can save us from sin, only loving God will deliver us from the world. Brothers and sisters, we must allow God's love to enter into us. Once the love of God enters, the world simply slips away.</P><P>First John 4:20 says, "If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen." This is a familiar verse to many, including unbelievers. This verse does not refer to loving the brother in your family, but your brother in Christ. Although the attitudes and behavior of many discourage you from loving them, once God's love enters into you, you will be able to love them. It is not loving the brother whom you love, but all the brothers. It is also not loving a lovable brother, but all the brothers. If you do not love all the brothers, the love of the Father is not in you; but if you have the love of God, you cannot help but love them.</P><P>The father of a man was killed; afterwards, the man was determined to get revenge. However, he was a genuine Christian. During the bread-breaking meeting one day, he found himself, along with others around a huge round table, sitting next to his adversary, the one who had killed his father. He left the table and went out because a battle had risen up within him. Should he kill him, or should he return to take the bread with him? At that instant God showed him the love of Christ. He saw that though he himself was an enemy to God, Christ saved him. He was melted by God's love. Wiping his tears, he went in to break bread with his enemy. When they were leaving, he no longer looked upon the man as his adversary, but his brother in Christ. If we truly have the love of God, we are able to love even an unlovable brother.</P><P>First John 5:2-3 says, "In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do His commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome." Why is it that we can keep God's commandments when we love Him? Let us look at John 14:21: "He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me." This says that if we love the Lord, we will keep His commandments. Brothers and sisters, who among us dares to say that he has kept all the commandments that God has given us? Never mind the unknown commandments, were all the known ones kept? Having God's commandments means to find them. How many believers plug their ears for fear that God may speak a commandment to them? We not only ought to obey when God commands us, we ought to find His commandments. Furthermore, we must keep them once they are found. Seeking God's commandments is our care for Him. This is loving God.</P><P>"He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him" (John 14:21b). This speaks of the benefit of loving God. Though I have met many well-known children of God, I have yet to see but a few who know God. Many can read the Bible, but they do not know God. They may understand the Bible, but they do not know the power of God. Others preach without knowing what they are preaching because the Lord has not manifested Himself to them. Even if the Lord were to stand before them, they still could not know Him without His revelation. Many have not experienced the Lord's manifestation because they do not love the Lord; neither do they keep the commandments of the Lord. Only one kind of people love the Lord on this earth-the faithful ones.</P><P>Never go to big and popular places to look for those who know the Lord. Oftentimes you will find one serving God in a secluded place or in a simple house. When you see such a one, you meet God's presence. Some people always stir my respect. Others may be zealous, capable, kind, humble, and gentle, but one does not necessarily see God through them. A certain one asked me once, "What were the strong points of this missionary?" I said, "There was always the sensation of God every time I saw her." This is God's revelation. You should remember the great woman of Shunem who said to her husband, "I perceive that this is a holy man of God, which passeth by us continually" (2 Kings 4:9). What had Elisha shown this woman? He did not perform any miracles. Rather, every time he came, he gave the woman the sensation of God. Brothers and sisters, do we love God's manifestation? If we do, we should employ every means to find God's commandments and keep them.</P><P>"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him" (John 14:23). God and Christ are present with all who believe in Him; however, God and Christ only make an abode with those who love Him. It is not just a matter of presence, but of an abode. A presence at times cannot be felt. But when one faithfully seeks God's commandments at all costs, he will experience the Lord making an abode with him.</P><P>John 15:9-10 says, "As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love." What does abiding in the Lord's love mean? We all sensed how much the Lord loved us when we were first saved. But today we do not sense His love that much. Though we can still speak of the depth of the Lord's love, we do not feel it. If we abide in the Lord's love, we should always sense such a love. Abiding in the Lord's love is just affording Him the opportunity to love. In other words, it is to be enveloped in His love. When others oppose and forsake us, we will really know how the Lord loves us. If we always find God's commandments and obey them, we will abide in His love. Did the Lord not sense the Father's love for even a single moment? He was constantly in the Father's love because He kept God's commandments. In order to abide in the Lord's love, we must always keep His commandments. If the love of God is in us, we can keep even the most difficult of His commandments. Some forsook their parents, some their wives, others their positions, and still others their fame, all because they loved God. They were enabled by the very love of God.</P><P>Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God." Many know this verse well. Only one kind of people enjoy the good: those who love God. If you do not love God, perhaps not even one thing is working for you. God does not alter things; He changes your heart. If you love God, then all things, though unaltered, will work for your good. Sometimes you complain about everything that comes your way. You complain concerning this and concerning that. Yet if love is there, all these will mean nothing to you. Loving God will make an unsatisfactory environment a profitable one.</P><P>First Corinthians 2:9-10 says, "But as it is written, `Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.' But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit." What do we see in these two verses? What God has prepared for those who believe is eternal life, yet the thing which God has prepared for those who love Him is in the future. Only those who love God can know of this coming blessing. If someone tells you about a marvelous thing he saw, it surely will not be comparable because the coming blessing has not yet been seen by eyes. If someone tells you about a wonderful thing he heard, it also must be a lesser thing than the coming blessing because no ears have heard it. If someone can indeed imagine the unsurpassable best, it still cannot compare to the coming blessing because it has not yet entered into the heart of man. Nevertheless, God has revealed to us by His Spirit this thing which no eyes have seen, no ears have heard, and what has not entered into man's heart. In other words, a lover of the Lord may enjoy what men have not seen, heard, nor dreamed of in this life. When God discloses His glory to you, you will exclaim, "Oh, what joy!" This heavenly glory is so much that you will find it hardly bearable.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we must suffer for the Lord and willingly pay the price to take this way. We must love the Lord so that He can reveal His glory to us.</P><P>James 1:12 says, "Blessed is the man who endures trial, because when he has become approved by testing, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him." We often think of the labor we need to perform in order to obtain a crown of life. However, one of the conditions required to gain the crown is to love the Lord. Brothers and sisters, our love toward God is lacking! It seems as if we have already lost our first love! This is most regrettable!</P><P>In John 21 the Lord asked Peter if he loved Him and told him to feed His lambs. If someone truly loves the Lord, he will definitely care for people's souls. One cannot love the Lord while neglecting the souls of men. You must care for the souls of your colleagues, relatives, and whoever is close to you.</P><P>John 14:28 says, "If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I." When we love the Lord, we will not only love the brothers and keep God's commandments, but we will also rejoice that the Lord Jesus went to the Father. In other words, we will surely rejoice that the Lord Jesus has gone to the Father to obtain His glory. This is too profound! Many have no realization of the magnitude of glory when the Lord ascended to the Father who is greater than He. Without such a realization, we cannot worship God. We care that those we love will obtain glory, but if we love the Lord, we will definitely rejoice at the Lord's going to the Father.</P><P>Matthew 10:37 and 38 say, "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me." After reading these two verses, we should realize that only by dropping all considerations can we love the Lord more dearly. A certain believer remarked that when we worship, we should not only be aware of God's greatness but also of His loveliness. This is a most meaningful word. We come before Him and draw near to Him because of His loveliness.</P><P>How does God love us? The Bible speaks a great deal about God's loving us. Concerning the individual aspect, it says that He "loved me and gave Himself up for me" (Gal. 2:20). Concerning the corporate aspect, it says that "Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her" (Eph. 5:25). Romans 5:8 tells us that "God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." First John 4:10 says, "Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins." He loved us and sent His Son to die for us. There is no love apart from the cross. Why did the Lord ordain that we break bread once a week? The Lord did not want us to forsake Him or forget Him; He wants to draw us back. If we recall the pain of being sinners and the greatness of the Lord's salvation towards us, how can we not love Him? In the wilderness, the Israelites thought of the melons and leeks of Egypt, forgetting Pharaoh's torment with the pain of slavery and God's deliverance of them out of their anguish. Their hearts would not give up Egypt. If we forget the cross, we will forget God's love; when we forget God's love, we cannot but think of the world.</P><P>How can we love God? Luke 7:47 says, "For this reason I say to you, Her sins which are many are forgiven, because she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, he loves little." If we would only recall how our sins were forgiven, we cannot help but love the Lord. The day the cross ceases to inspire you, you have already fallen. Mr. Evan Roberts wept for months over his inability to receive the cross's inspiration until God touched him. The result was the mighty revival in Wales. Since then there has not been a more prevailing revival. The woman could wash the Lord's feet with her tears, wipe them with her hair, and kiss them with her mouth because she remembered that her sins had been forgiven.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we must stand beneath the cross. Even if our spiritual condition becomes a hundredfold stronger, we should still remember how our sins have been forgiven.</P><P>First Corinthians 16:22 says, "If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed! The Lord comes!" This is a most serious word! If anyone does not love the Lord, he is accursed.</P><P>Ephesians 6:24 says, "Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility." To whom is grace given here? God gives it to those who love the Lord in incorruptibility. If others would ask you, "Do you believe in the Lord?", the whole world would marvel if you answer, "I am one who loves the Lord."</P><P>First Peter 1:8 says, "Whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory." This verse says that we love Him because we believe in Him. What is born out of this love through believing? It is joy that is unspeakable and full of glory.</P><P>Finally, brothers and sisters, I wish to repeat what that old believer said to the departing young man: "May you be a passionate lover of the Lord Jesus!"</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A DEFEATED RIGHTEOUS MAN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 38</H2><P>This morning I want to tell the story of one person. The title of this story is "A Defeated Righteous Man." This title means that the person is defeated, but he is also a righteous man. There are victorious righteous people, and there are defeated righteous people. We must use this defeated righteous man as a warning in order to be victorious righteous persons. Who is this defeated righteous one? Let us read 2 Peter 2:6-8 in the Bible.</P><P>"And having reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, condemned them to ruin, having set them as an example to those who intend to live an ungodly life, and rescued righteous Lot, who had been oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless (for that righteous man, who settled down among them, in seeing and hearing tormented his righteous soul day after day with their lawless works)." Lot was such a person. His soul was a righteous soul, and he was a righteous man. His soul was tormented day after day upon seeing and hearing unlawful works. Since he was such a man, why do we say that he was a defeated righteous man?</P><P>We have to know who Lot was. Lot was neither a famous person nor an uncommon man. Lot is well-known because he had a famous uncle, Abraham. His uncle was a renowned man. He became well-known because of his uncle. Let us read in the book of Genesis to see what kind of person Lot was.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BEGINNING OF LOT</H2><P>Genesis 11:31 says, "And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there." If we read Acts 7, we know that when Abraham was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, God appeared to him and called him out of his country and his kindred to go into a land which God would show him. He left the land of the Chaldeans for Canaan. He was not the only one who left Ur of the Chaldees; his father followed him. And Abraham's father was not the only one who left with him; his nephew Lot also followed him. Lot was just like a "preacher's boy" or part of a believer's family. Lot followed his uncle when he left Ur for Canaan because his uncle said that Ur of the Chaldees was a place of confusing morality that had been condemned by God and that they had to go to Canaan because God had called them to leave Ur.</P><P>According to the historians, Abraham's house was a house of idol-makers. This, most likely, was the profession of Abraham's father. Joshua 24 mentions that Abraham was brought out of the house of idol-worshippers. Since Lot heard his uncle say that he wanted to leave the world behind and no longer live carelessly, he followed his uncle and departed from Ur.</P><P>Our friends here today may not have personally heard God's call. Perhaps your grandfather, father, mother, wife, or uncle have heard God's call and brought you along. Lot himself did not hear God's call. Only his uncle heard it. This is why he left with his uncle. Perhaps your father, brother, sister, or wife believed first, but eventually you also believed. You are a Lot. If there is someone in your house who has believed in the Lord, and if you are not willing to follow, you are wrong. It is best to follow. It is excellent when some people follow their mother or father in believing, but unfortunately, many people themselves do not know God. Your grandfather believes, your uncle believes, but you do not know God. This is a pity.</P><P>Lot was good. Not only did he follow his uncle, but he was also a righteous person. Abraham was like an older believer. Lot was like a young believer. Since Lot and Abraham were relatives and had taken the same path, it should have been excellent. The beginning of these two men was excellent, but eventually they separated. How were they separated? Let us look at the ensuing passage in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LOT'S CHOICE</H2><P>Genesis 13:5-6 says, "And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together." It is easy to bear suffering and distress together. It is more difficult to be in comfort together. The two men left Ur together and went to Canaan. This was very good, and God blessed them. Their possessions multiplied. However, problems arise as soon as possessions multiply. If I have a place to live, you will not have the same place to live. If you have a place to live, I will not be able to have the same place. If your flocks and herds have grass to feed on, mine will have none. If my flocks and herds have grass, yours will have none. You may not say anything, and I may not say anything, but the servants will speak even if the masters do not.</P><P>Genesis 13:7 says, "And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle." There was a strife among their subordinates. One said, "My cattle must graze on the pasture here." The other said, "My sheep need to be fed here." They could not dwell together because their possessions were too great. Many people can leave Ur of the Chaldees together, but trouble begins to happen once they get to Canaan.</P><P>I would like to mention one thing in passing. Many places in the Bible symbolize the world: Ur of the Chaldees symbolizes the confusion of the world, Sodom and Gomorrah symbolize the pleasure of sin and the evil of the world, and Egypt symbolizes the fact that the world is under the authority of Satan. These three places symbolize the world, but each symbol has its own unique emphasis.</P><P>Lot was able to let go of Ur's chaos. However, he was reluctant to give up something when he reached Canaan. A Christian is the same. After believing in the Lord, he may be unwilling to abandon spiritual fame and position in the work. Formerly, he struggled and strove in the world; now he strives and struggles in the church. Originally, he was struggling for gain in an idolatrous profession. Now he is struggling for gain in the church.</P><P>Genesis 13:8-9 says, "And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left." One reason Christians fall is that they cannot dwell together with other Christians. The moment you realize that you cannot live with other Christians, you will find that you can no longer communicate with them. Whenever you say that Christians are worse than your relatives, you will become afraid to see them. This is evidence that something has gone wrong with your spiritual life. Whenever you find that you cannot get along with other Christians, that is the time when you are being defeated.</P><P>All the blame was with Lot. Abraham was the head of the family. Lot was a young man. Lot gained his inheritance through his uncle. He should not have allowed his herdmen to strive with Abraham's herdmen. With Abraham there was no strife; with him, there was always the victory. Lot should have said, "My cattle can starve to death, but I cannot leave my uncle. There is only one family who believes in the Lord in the land of Canaan, how can I depart?" Yet Lot did not think this way. He thought that it was more important for his cattle to have grass to eat than for himself to be fed. He would rather have a breach in fellowship with his uncle than lose his cattle. He would rather renounce his spiritual achievement than allow his possessions to suffer loss. He would rather drop Abraham than one of his cattle. "Since today my uncle opened his mouth and asked me to choose, I should choose the best." So he made his choice.</P><P>Genesis 13:10 says, "And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar." The first thing that stepped in was material goods. Young people are very bold when they first believe in the Lord. Lot left when his uncle left. Later after tasting the flavor of the world, it seemed that the matter of believing in the Lord could be set aside and that fellowship with other Christians need not be taken care of. He "lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered." He did not care whether or not Abraham's cattle had grass to feed on. He cared only for his own cattle.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, I will not ask how many years you have believed in the Lord. I only want to tell you that today God has set two ways before you. God puts the world before you, and He also spreads the land of Canaan before you. God wants to see how you will choose.</P><P>Lot beheld all the plain of Jordan unto Zoar. It was like the garden of the Lord and the land of Egypt. On the one hand, it was like paradise; on the other hand, it was like Egypt. This is the world. Sodom and Gomorrah represent the sinful pleasure of the world. The worldly people seek pleasure in sin.</P><P>Genesis 13:11 says, "Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other." In the world there are blessings, glory, and pleasure. Therefore, Lot chose all the plain of Jordan. Perhaps he thought, "This is somewhat like paradise!" A brother once sinned, and I asked him how he felt. He said that there was a bit of heaven's pleasure in it. After he believed in the Lord, he found out that he could not do this or that. Now that he committed a little sin, he found some pleasure in it. In Lot's eyes, Sodom and Gomorrah were like paradise. I am afraid that what the world shows us is a little like heaven.</P><P>However, Sodom and Gomorrah also look somewhat like Egypt. A Christian's conscience enables him to know that there is a distinction. It is like paradise, but it is also like Egypt. There is pleasure in it, but there is also pain. In Egypt the Israelites were slaves to the Egyptians. They were afflicted and scourged by the Egyptians. They were not given straw, but they still had to produce bricks. Therefore, the Israelites wanted to leave Egypt. If you love the world, you may have some amount of pleasure and blessing, and you may feel that the world is like paradise, but your conscience will make you feel uneasy. On the one hand, many Christians feel happy when they sin. On the other hand, their conscience does not give them peace. Oh, it is like paradise in one aspect, and yet it is similar to Egypt in another aspect. On the one hand, there is the pleasure of paradise. On the other hand, there is the affliction of Egypt.</P><P>What is the preference of all the young brothers and sisters here today? Is it the world? Or is it pleasure? God does not force you to take a particular way. God wants you to make the choice yourself. Are you an Abraham choosing Canaan? Or are you a Lot preferring the world? Lot did not choose to live in the city; he only chose to be outside the city. All the plain of Jordan was a pleasure, but at the same time, it was a suffering. Where are you living day after day?</P><P>The geography of Canaan is as follows: on the east side is the river Euphrates. (This was the river Euphrates which Abraham crossed from Ur of the Chaldees to Canaan.) On the west side is the Jordan River. Canaan lies in between the two rivers. What does the Bible say after Lot chose all the plain of Jordan? "Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east" (13:11). "Journeyed east" was to move towards Sodom. This was the fall. Since he made this choice, he was able to move east gradually. No one succumbs to sin in one day. No one falls in one day. It is all a matter of losing a little today and a little tomorrow. After a while, one falls into sins. If you choose the plain, it is easy for you to shepherd the flock and look for water because there is no need to climb the mountains, and you can live comfortably. If you desire comfort and do not want hardship, your tent will slowly move eastward. If you love the sinful pleasure of the world, your feet will eventually walk toward the world. If you cannot hold back the first step, you will not be able to hold back the second step. Since your heart leans toward the world, you cannot keep your feet from walking toward the world. Since your eyes are fixed on the world, you cannot safeguard your feet from treading upon the world. If you have chosen the world, you will not be able to keep your feet from walking in the world.</P><P>Genesis 13:12 says, "Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain." Friends, brothers, and sisters, I do not know what choice you have made today. Abraham yielded the fat and beautiful land to Lot. He remained in the land of Canaan, the land to which God called him, the land that God could bless, and the place where he could receive spiritual edification. What about Lot? He dwelt in the cities of the plain of the Jordan River, the place that he chose. Are we like Abraham, who dwelt in Canaan, the land to which God called him? Or are we like Lot, who lived in the cities of the plain of the river Jordan, which he chose by himself?</P><P>Genesis 13:12 says, "Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom." Lot thought to himself, "I am a righteous man. If I choose Sodom, I will surely fall and become apostate. However, it may be all right to choose a place outside Sodom. This is merely close to Sodom; it is not in Sodom. It is not good to be completely in Sodom, but perhaps it is all right to be near Sodom." Oh, we may think that it is not good to choose the world, yet perhaps it is permissible to choose something or some place that borders the world. Many Christians are borderline Christians. The world says, "You do not look like one of us." Canaan also says, "You do not look like one of us." It is true that you are only settling close to the world, but you do not live in Canaan either. On which side are you? Once I was in a village, and I asked a soldier why some soldiers so easily change sides. He said that it was because the uniform was gray. The color gray is a mixture of black and white. It is neither white nor black. Many Christians are like this. They do not seem to be on this side or that side. They seem to be in Paradise, yet at the same time in Egypt. They are reluctant to give up God on this side, and they are unwilling to let go of the world on the other side.</P><P>Friends, on which side are you today? Are you a gray Christian, one who is neither white nor black? When you encounter people of the world, do they consider you degraded or a twelfth-century man, who is very different from others in the world? The sad thing is that some consider Christians to be very different, yet find that they are just like themselves! This is the saddest remark an outsider can make toward a Christian! Many are not willing to stand up to say that they belong to Christ. Since they are already Christians, they do not consider it to be of any importance to acknowledge it. They cannot let go of Paradise, but they also want Egypt. They go to church on Sunday mornings, and they read the Bible for five minutes every day, thinking that they are Christians. However, they do not have real Christian fellowship. They cannot really give up the cattle. Nevertheless, we must ask God to deliver us out of this way. Otherwise, it will be very dangerous.</P><P>You may think that it is all right that you have not entered Sodom, that you have not become apostate, and that you have not declared that you do not believe in the Lord Jesus. However, your tent is gradually moving, and it will move all the way to Sodom. If you take the first step, it is inevitable that you will take the second step. If you have chosen to face Sodom, you will eventually enter the city of Sodom. If you have chosen worldly pleasure, you will inevitably end up in sin and evil. If you have chosen material goods, you will inevitably be defiled. You must say, "God, in what direction are my feet heading toward?" Originally, you were outside the cities of the plain, but your tent can move gradually. I do not know whether your feet have moved or not. I do not know if you have entered Sodom or not. Perhaps the footprints you have left behind will tell whether or not your feet have moved. At first, you can choose to leave other Christians because you value your cattle. But it is inevitable that your footsteps will move further along. Thank God that there are still many Christians today whose tents are in Canaan. May we see that we must repudiate the sin of the world as well as the pleasure of the world.</P><P>Genesis 13:13 says, "But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly." Did Lot know the condition of Sodom? Lot knew. The Sodomites were exceedingly sinful and wicked before the Lord. Yet step by step Lot moved into Sodom. When your feet move away from other Christians, your tent will also gradually move toward Sodom. What God hates, you will not hate. What God condemns, you will no longer condemn. Your feet will slowly move eastward. There is a saying in the north which goes, "Slow is not something to be afraid of, but standing still is." Standing still is something Satan fears. But being slow easily gives opportunity to Satan. This is how temptation comes in. If we go against our conscience a little today, we will go against it a little more tomorrow. If we cut down a little in reading the Bible today, we will cut down a little more tomorrow. If we pray a few minutes less today, we will pray a few minutes less tomorrow. If we testify a little less today, we will testify a little less tomorrow. By these reductions day after day, we eventually backslide. Satan does not make us cease from going to the meetings, reading the Bible, praying, and testifying all at once. He causes us to backslide gradually, bit by bit and moment by moment. He is extremely patient in dragging us along.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S WARNING</H2><P>Lot's tent was gradually pitched "toward Sodom." What danger did he run into? In Genesis 14:9-12 four kings went to war with five. "And the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed" (vv. 10-12). This war was between two forces: five kings were defeated by four kings. Lot and his goods were also captured. Lot was captured because he dwelt in Sodom. The last time we saw him, he was still outside the city; but now he was dwelling in the city. The last time someone saw you, you might have still looked like a Christian; but now you have become a citizen of Sodom. The more sins you commit, the closer you are to Sodom. After a while, you will feel that the country is not as good as the city. As time goes on, you will even feel that the plain is not as good as the city.</P><P>Lot's residing in Sodom was not without God's warning. When the five kings were defeated by the four kings, Lot was also captured. This was a warning God gave to Lot that Sodom was not the place to be. Today I will ask you most frankly; this is also my word to you. If someone is sick, meets with failures in his business, or has problems in his family, these all are probably warnings from God. The defeat of the five kings by the four kings was God's warning to Lot not to dwell in Sodom. Lot's tent was gradually pitched "toward Sodom." Later he even became a citizen of Sodom. The way Lot moved was a little today, a little tomorrow, a little this time, and a little more the next time. After a few moves, he eventually moved into the city. Therefore, God gave Lot a warning. What about us today? Perhaps some experience the death of their spouse or the death of their son, and perhaps some become sick or meet with business failures. God's warning might be in these happenings. If you are a Christian, yet drawing closer to the world day by day, God will warn you and give you no peace. God gives you His warning so that you will turn back quickly.</P><P>It is a pity that many Christians have no feelings; they cannot feel pain. Even though they realize that they are sick, that they have business failures, and that their families have problems, they do not know that these are God's scourging. As a result, they will not turn back. However, if they do not turn back, greater things will happen to them. There was a brother, who though not yet backsliding, was gradually losing his heart. Another brother advised him one day that he should not go on in that manner anymore. He answered, "It does not matter. Mr. So-and-so was very zealous at first, then he gradually lost his heart. This year at the age of sixty, his oldest son who had just graduated from college died suddenly, and the old man has now become zealous again." The one who advised him then said, "God will most certainly accomplish things according to your wish." He said, "I certainly do not want this." Friends, if you belong to God, and if your feet walk toward the sinful world, God will certainly discipline you. If you are sick, and if you experience family problems or business failure, you should inquire of God. If God says that these things have happened to you because you have forsaken Him, you should turn back. Many times if the love of God cannot draw us, He will scourge us with a whip. If God's word cannot touch us, He will press us with adversity. If you belong to the Lord and have committed sin or become backslidden, God will most certainly discipline you. He will not let you go. (Fortunately, Lot was rescued by his uncle when he was captured.)</P><P>Lot first dwelt outside of the city and was only close to Sodom. A person may still act like a Christian; he may not have moved into the city, but he is touching Sodom, and the boundary line is still very clear. But what happened at the end? He finally moved into the city. I will illustrate by a story. There was a child whose mother gave him six candies and told him to save them and eat them the next day. The child put the candies in front of him. He wanted to eat them but dared not to. Yet he could not bear the thought of not eating them. What did he do? He put each candy on his lip and licked it with his tongue. In this way, he licked all six candies again and again. At first there were six candies. Later they became smaller one by one. After a while one was gone, and five remained. And then two were gone, and four remained. In the end all six were eaten up. This is the way many Christians fall into sins. They disobey their conscience once, twice, until gradually they seek happiness in the world. Brothers and sisters, please realize that one does not stop sinning after the first sin. Once a person commits one sin, an addiction is built up which will cause him to commit sin again next time. Every time a person commits a sin, there are two results: first, it affords one the pleasure of sin; second, it builds up an addiction to commit more sin. Lot moved into the city gradually. Is it possible for you not to go into the city? At the beginning, we think that we will only commit that much sin and not go into the city. But there is no such thing. If you reach the entrance of Sodom, you will certainly go into the city. Either you do not sin or you sin. If you sin, you will not have the power to restrict yourself to that one sin and avoid committing more sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LOT'S END</H2><P>Genesis 19:1 says that Lot sat at the gate of Sodom. At that time the custom of all the countries in the east was not like today's court. These countries judged the civil affairs at the gate of the city. Their judges were those who were elected among the qualified ones in the city, and they served as the elders. As judges they sat at the gate of the city to judge the civil affairs. Lot sat at the gate of the city; he was promoted. He was not only a commoner of Sodom; he became a judge. Lot's position in the world had become higher and more advanced. The way to sin is like this; it only goes faster. At first Lot was only near Sodom. Later on, he dwelt in Sodom, and finally he became a judge in Sodom.</P><P>What was the result of Lot's doing such things? His wife died halfway, his daughters committed fornication, and his sons-in-law were burnt by the fire from heaven.</P><P>The book of 2 Peter says that Lot was a righteous man (2:7), but he forgot that he had taken residence in Sodom. He even shed tears for those who were evil, but he forgot to shed tears for himself. A person can shed tears for other Christians, but forget to shed tears for himself. Lot saw the great sins in the people of Sodom. He even wanted to help them. But he did not realize that he could not do it. Many Christians are the same way. They have become backslidden, yet they still urge others to believe in the Lord Jesus.</P><P>God wanted to destroy Sodom. But He listened to Abraham's prayer, and two angels went to rescue Lot. Genesis 19:12-14 says, "And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it. And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons-in-law." Lot had no testimony in front of his sons-in-law. They thought that he mocked them. People may believe if you say that the street is on fire. But no one will believe if you say that there will be fire coming from the heaven. People may still believe if you say that the fire of the gas tank will burn a man. But no one will believe if you say that brimstone will burn a man.</P><P>Genesis 19:16 says, "And while he lingered..." These words show a vivid portrait. It seems that Lot wanted to speak to his cows and sheep: "O cows, for you I separated myself from Abraham; for you I chose the plain of Jordan. O sheep, you have been in my place for five years, can I desert you today?" It seems that he looked at his furniture, his treasures, his sheepfold, and his warehouse, and thought, "I thought that I could live in Sodom forever. I wanted to build a larger warehouse to store all my goods and belongings. And then I would speak to my soul and say, `Soul, eat, drink, and be merry.' Am I going to leave all these behind? Am I going to walk away like this today? I cannot suffer losing so many wonderful things!"</P><P>Genesis 19:16-17 says, "The men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed." These were the instructions to them after the angels led them out of the city. Today you are in the world, and you may not have much money. But you may be as reluctant to part company with the world as Lot. There was an old lady who only had fifteen dollars, and she counted them every day. We may laugh at her for her obsession with money. But when a person with a box full of property deeds inspects them and treasures them, God in the heavens laughs at him in the same way that we laugh at the old lady. In our eyes fifteen dollars means nothing. But in God's eyes, a box full of title deeds also means nothing.</P><P>The Lord Jesus is coming soon. The destruction of Sodom is a type of the coming destruction of the world. If all your hopes, whether great or small, are built on this world, one day the fire from heaven will consume them all. One day God will destroy them all. When that day comes, you will not be able to escape even if you want to. There will be no way for you to escape. Whatever you cannot let go of today will be let go in that day. At the time of the rapture, God will only rapture men; He will not rapture any objects. God will only save men; He will not put out fire. Therefore, today we should gladly let things go.</P><P>Genesis 19:26 says, "But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt." Lot's wife followed her husband's desire; she looked back. Even though there was nothing more to see, a glance back at the burning fire would still make her feel better. What she wanted to see indicated what her heart would not let go of. This looking back tells us many things and expresses many inward feelings. This look turned her into a pillar of salt, and she became a serious warning to us even until today! The Lord said, "But on the day in which Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. It will be in the same way on the day in which the Son of Man is revealed...Remember Lot's wife" (Luke 17:29-30, 32). At the coming of the Lord, this world will also be judged, and everything on the earth will be burned. The ones who love the world will be left on earth. They will be like Lot's wife, who remained on earth to become a pillar of salt.</P><P>Friends, I am afraid that we have paid too much attention to vain things and have forgotten about the eternal things. We are very busy with social activities, with our children's education, and with our businesses. It is right to educate our children and take care of our business. But the eternal things need our attention too. Friends, particularly young friends, your way may still be long. If the Lord still delays, let us choose today the way which we should take. Let us pay attention today to what is valuable, what is coming from God, and what will last to eternity. Let us hope that our glory is not today, that we will learn to draw near to God, and that we will go on properly in the way ahead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN ANNOUNCEMENT</H2><P>The detailed catalog from the Gospel Book Room has already been published.

I have taken verses from various places in the Bible. Some may wonder what these verses are all about. In particular, I want to draw your attention to Hosea 7:8, which says that "Ephraim is a cake/Not turned." Brothers, in God's eyes, there are always two sides to whatever we do. A bird can only fly with two wings. Even a blade of grass has to have two sides before it can be complete. Likewise, a door has to have two sides. In this universe, everything is balanced. What is true in the physical realm is also true in the spiritual realm; everything should be balanced between two sides.</P><P>Hosea 7:8 says, "Ephraim is a cake/Not turned." What is an unturned cake? Although many of us have not made cakes before, we all have eaten cakes. Even if we do not know how cakes are baked, we have at least seen others cooking bean curd or frying vegetables. If a person only cooks one side without turning it over, the result will surely be that one side is raw, and the other side is overcooked. One side will have too little heat, while the other side will have too much heat. Anyone who cooks vegetables or bean curd knows that the same amount of heat has to be applied to both sides. If one keeps cooking only one side, the result will be that one side is burnt and the other side is uncooked. Anything burnt cannot be considered proper food; it cannot feed others. Today I will not expound on Ephraim becoming an unturned cake through mixing himself with the Gentiles. I will only draw attention to the phrase "a cake not turned." This is a principle from God for our living. If a person pays too much attention to anything, he becomes a cake not turned. One can, of course, cook one side by exposing it to fire. But if he does not turn it to the other side, the whole piece will not be well-cooked and will become useless. The most important thing for a Christian to do is to be balanced. We will pick out some examples to see how a Christian who over-emphasizes one aspect of things will become a cake not turned.</P><P>Many Christians are living a life of an unturned cake. Many emphasize personal spiritual living and neglect the corporate life. This is an unturned cake. Some pay much attention to the corporate life but forget about the individual life. Such people are also unturned cakes. Some pay too much attention to righteousness and have no grace at all. Such people are unturned cakes. It is right to be righteous. But paying attention to righteousness all the time without taking care of grace is being an unturned cake. Some people are nice; they are good to others. But they do not have any principle of righteousness. They do not want to deal with others. They pay too much attention to grace and no attention to righteousness. This also is an unturned cake. Some people pay most of their attention to the objective truths and forget the work of the Holy Spirit within man. These people are also unturned cakes. Some people pay too much attention to the subjective truths and do not pay much attention to the accomplishments of Christ on the cross. They also are unturned cakes. We can say much more about what an unturned cake is. But because of time, I will only mention these few cases.</P><P>No truth should be over-emphasized. There is always the need of balance, and there is always the need to pay attention to both sides. With the Bible, we should be aware of two things. The first is fact, and the second is principle. A fact requires us to believe in it, while a principle requires us to obey it. Many people pay attention only to the facts and not to the principles. These persons are unturned cakes, being burnt on one side. Other people only pay attention to the principles and speak much about obedience, but they do not pay attention to the accomplished facts of Christ. These people are also unturned cakes, being burnt on the other side. Such an over-emphasis of one side will cause a Christian to have a distorted living and not bring him to perfection.</P><P>Today I will draw your attention to the matter of being a Christian in four aspects. We should not be an unturned cake. I cannot enumerate all the examples of unturned cakes. I can only mention a few of them. Now I will speak on being a four-sided Christian. On the one hand, we will consider the Lord's commands. On the other hand, we will consider Paul's pattern. The Gospels show us the Lord's commands, while Paul's Epistles show us his experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S COMMANDS</H2><P>First, the Lord commands His disciples to know. He says, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear" (Matt. 13:9). Again He says, "For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old" (v. 52). This refers to knowledge. If a believer is not an unturned cake, he will surely advance in knowledge.</P><P>Second, one should have faith because the Lord says, "Have faith in God." This is the original meaning of Mark 11:22.</P><P>Third, the Lord says, "Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest" (Matt. 9:38). This refers to zeal. We should be zealous for the gospel.</P><P>Fourth, the Lord says, "You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matt. 5:48). This refers to life and in particular to love. We may not be as perfect as the heavenly Father is in other aspects. But at least we should pursue to be as perfect as our heavenly Father is in love. The Lord once passed through Samaria, and the people there would not receive Him. When James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?" (Luke 9:54). The Lord turned and rebuked the two disciples, saying, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" (v. 55). Oh, we should know of what kind of spirit we are.</P><P>We have not divided these subjects randomly. If we read the Gospels carefully and group the Lord's commands together, they are of these four categories. The Lord turns our attention to either faith, zeal, knowledge, or life. It is always one of these four things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PAUL'S PATTERN</H2><P>The same is true with Paul. This is why he could say, "Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ" (1 Cor. 11:1).</P><P>As far as knowledge is concerned, even God feared that Paul's knowledge would become too great. Therefore, He allowed the messenger of Satan to buffet him and press him down so that he might not be exceedingly lifted up. Paul was caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words-words which were not allowed for a man to speak. It seemed as if God had shown him too much. Within him, there were still many things that he did not speak. There are still many questions which we would like to ask him today. He knew the mysteries, all kinds of mysteries. He mentioned "the transcendence of the revelations" (2 Cor. 12:7) that he received and that he was not inferior to the super-apostles in anything (v. 11).</P><P>Concerning faith, he said, "For we walk by faith, not by appearance" (2 Cor. 5:7). He said that he once fought with wild beasts at Ephesus (1 Cor. 15:32) and despaired even of living (2 Cor. 1:8). Yet through God who raises the dead (v. 9), he was able to find the good end. He could perform works of wonders and heal sickness. He was a prophet and not afraid of snake bites. When he was on a ship and everyone abandoned hope of being saved, even when no one had food for a long time and there seemed to be nothing that anyone could do, he was still able to calm everyone down. He could do this because of what he said: "I believe God that it shall be so, even in the way in which it has been spoken to me" (Acts 27:25). This was his life of faith.</P><P>Not only did he have knowledge and faith, but he was also excellent in life. He could say, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me" (Gal. 2:20). He could truly say, "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain" (Phil. 1:21) and "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body" (2 Cor. 4:10).</P><P>At the same time, he was very zealous in preaching the gospel. He was truly zealous. He went from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum, preaching the gospel of Christ everywhere he went. He said, "But now I no longer have place in these regions" (Rom. 15:23). Brothers, have you ever preached in a region until there was no longer any place to preach in that region? Paul said this as if he knew every face there. While he was on the road, he preached the gospel. While he was at sea, he preached the gospel. While he was in prison, he preached the gospel. Even while he was under bondage in Rome, his testimony became manifest among the whole Praetorian guard and to all the rest. This means that even his guards received the gospel. These guards were originally posted there to keep a watch on Paul. But they became locked up by the Christ whom Paul preached; they had become the prisoners of Christ.</P><P>My intention is not just to speak on the Lord's commands, nor on Paul's experience, but to draw your attention to one thing: a Christian ought to be a four-sided person. Every Christian must pay attention to these four things. Not only should we have zeal, but faith as well. Not only should we grow in knowledge, but in life as well. If any one of the four things are missing, there will be an imbalance. Please analyze the experiences of Paul when you read the New Testament again, and see if zeal, faith, knowledge, and life are the four characteristics of Paul. We are only speaking in a general way. This is why we say that there are only these four points. According to the Lord's commands, we should not only be encouraged to have zeal and faith, but we should also grow in knowledge and life.</P><P>Today I will speak a little more about faith. Sadly, the church has become desolate and lost its eyes for the Lord. We have a perfect Lord, but there are so many different kinds of Christians. I am not talking about differences in terms of sins. Some have tempers, while others have pride. The devil can create a hundred different kinds of sins. The differences I am talking about are the differences in the good things. Brothers, when you contact others, do you not feel that there are many different kinds of virtues?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXAMPLES OF ONE-SIDEDNESS</H2><P>Once I met a Western missionary preaching in Kweichow. He was very zealous for the Lord in China. Although he was a university graduate and a capable man, he was willing to give up everything in order to preach the gospel in inland China. During the Boxer Rebellion, he was preaching the gospel in China. He had many virtues and was very powerful in preaching. Yet his virtues were all one-sided in the matter of zeal; he was lacking in the other aspects.</P><P>I also met a missionary in Shanghai who was very good at memorizing the Scriptures. He could memorize the Scriptures verse by verse and expound them with much light. His knowledge was very good, but in the matter of faith in God, he was lacking. When he was sick, he was hopeless. When he caught a cold, he would have to find a doctor. As far as his knowledge was concerned, he could speak about faith. But he had no assurance of what faith actually was. At the same time, his life did not match his knowledge.</P><P>I knew another Western missionary who was as gentle as a lamb. Whenever you prayed with her, she would carry you away with her gentleness. She never lost her temper. Wherever she was, God's presence was there. She indeed had considerable growth in life, but she did not have much knowledge. She was also strong in faith, though faith was not her special characteristic. She also had zeal, but her zeal was not as strong as her growth in life.</P><P>Another Western missionary had great faith. She could believe even when she had nothing in her pocket. Every time I was with her, she always said that she was down to the last dollar in her pocket. Although she lived in the countryside for many years, she never experienced any financial difficulties. When she spoke on the victory of Christ, there was the real manifestation of the victory of Christ. But in other aspects, she was not as strong as her faith.</P><P>Does this mean that Christians can be divided into four categories: the zealous kind, the faithful kind, the knowledgeable kind, and the life kind? May we not have the intention of criticizing others, but may we gain some benefit from this study. We are not separating people into categories in an intentional way. We are merely saying that naturally there are these four groups. These are not differences in sins but differences in good things. When a man develops himself in a certain area and becomes more advanced in that area, those who come in contact with him will feel that he is excellent in a certain, particular aspect. Some may be the zealous kind, while others may be the faith kind. Some may belong to the knowledge group, while others may belong to the life group. As long as one has special growth only in one area, his growth will be distorted. Either he has to continually advance in certain points or continually advance in some other points. It is difficult to find a four-sided Christian who is advancing on all four sides.</P><P>I admit that the holiness group of believers have certain virtues in certain areas. They pay a great deal of attention to life. Men like John Wesley were excellent in their growth in life; the beauty that was manifested in their life is unmatched. They knew God very well. But one does not find many among them with deep and profound knowledge. They were lacking in knowledge. They were good at faith and zeal, but they were still short in knowledge.</P><P>Among the so-called Brethren, you can find one interesting phenomenon. Their specialty is not faith. I do not mean to say that they have no faith. Their specialty is not life. I do not mean to say that they are poor in life. Even more their specialty is not zeal. They seem to be somewhat cool for gospel preaching. Yet they are particularly strong in knowledge, Bible teaching, and the light and revelation they have received from God. They are particularly gifted in the aspect of knowledge.</P><P>The founder of the China Inland Mission, Mr. Hudson Taylor, was a man of great faith. At the beginning when he started the China Inland Mission, he only had a few sterling pounds in his pocket. He deposited this money into the bank under the name of the China Inland Mission. This was the beginning of the China Inland Mission. Today they receive offerings about every minute. At the beginning, only a few went to the China inland to preach. Even while the money in his hands was only enough to support a few people, he prayed that God would send more men to China. First he asked God to send a few, then a few dozen, and finally a few hundred. He was very advanced in faith and zeal. He was also very good in life. But in knowledge, he was not very outstanding.</P><P>Mr. George Muller was also a person advanced in faith and life. But his specialty was not the light of the truth. He was very good in life and zeal. But his specialty was his faith.</P><P>As for zeal, we can find many people who are very zealous in China and in other countries. For example, the first person to come to China, Mr. Robert Morrison, was very zealous. But he was stronger in zeal than in other areas.</P><P>I present all these cases to you to draw your attention to the fact that we should not be one-sided. This is not what God is after. If a person is good in knowledge, we receive help from him. He may not be that zealous, but we should not therefore consider that zeal is unimportant. A bad thing among believers today is that some do not want knowledge at all, while others do not pay attention to life at all. Those who emphasize life but not knowledge think that it is all right even if one does not know anything. Those who emphasize knowledge but not life can lose their temper as soon as they finish their preaching. While their temper is still with them and the redness still on their face, they can sit down and immediately start teaching again. Brothers, we should not pay attention only to others' shortcomings. But at the same time, we should not pay attention only to others' virtues. Someone may be good in knowledge but not good in life. Others may be good in faith but inadequate in zeal. Still others may be good in life but not preach the gospel to others. Some are good in faith, and you should follow their faith. Some are good in knowledge, and you should follow them in their knowledge. Some are good in life, and you should follow them in life. Some are good in zeal, and you should follow them in zeal. If you want to be a four-sided Christian, you should pursue all four things.</P><P>Faith enables us to receive God's power. Knowledge enables us to know the things of God. Life enables us to express God's love and light. Zeal enables us to bring God to men and give God's salvation to men. Whenever there is the opportunity, we should pass out gospel tracts, and we must testify to our colleagues, family members, and children. If we only emphasize one of these four aspects, we are an unturned cake.</P><P>Furthermore, we should be people who experience answers to our prayers. A believer once told me that prayers are for children and that grown-ups do not have to pray. This is a joke. Saying that one can advance from getting answers to prayer to not getting answers to prayers and advance from God answering prayers to God not answering prayers is like "advancing" from a grown-up to a child! Those who say this think that they have advanced. They may have advanced in knowledge but certainly not in faith. If a Christian never has his prayers answered, we cannot say that he is an experienced person. Every Christian must experience some answers to prayers. Faith is always indispensable. In the church, there are not a few who have knowledge, zeal, and even life. But the greatest lack is those who have faith. It is easy to find growth in other aspects. But it is difficult to find growth in faith.</P><P>Furthermore, knowledge is also very important; it has its place. If a Christian does not know the basic truths of the Bible, if he is ignorant of the principles of God's work, and if he does not understand the general outlines of the Bible, he will take in all kinds of doctrines. For example, in the matter of baptism, someone may tell him to be baptized with his face looking downward because the Lord lowered His head on the cross. He may think that this is very reasonable. But if he has biblical knowledge, he will see that the Lord lowered His head on the cross, not in the tomb. If all one cares for is scriptural quotations and does not ask for what purpose they are quoted, he may end up lowering his head even when he eats. Many believers have been listening to messages for one, two, or even five years. If anyone asked them about the difference between justification and salvation, they would say that the two things are more or less the same. They do not know what justification is and what salvation is. To them forgiveness and salvation are more or less the same. In fact, everything is more or less the same. Only paying attention to faith is to be cooked on one side; it is to be an unturned cake. Those without knowledge do not know how to go on and do not know how to lead others to go on because they are blind.</P><P>At the same time, we should pay attention to life. We should seek for God and overcome all sins. May God cause us to realize our sins, and may God put our besetting sins under our feet. How many of us can say that we know we have overcome all sins through Christ living in us? If a Christian does not grow, it is because he has not overcome his sins. We should daily deny ourselves and deal with ourselves. Not only do we have to deal with sins every day, but we also have to obey God. We have to allow the Holy Spirit to work within us day by day so that His life can flow out of us.</P><P>I am presenting these four things before all of you. If we want to be a perfect Christian, we have to pursue these four things. We should not pay attention to just one of them, but we should have a balanced development in all four areas. We should not be an unturned cake. We should not only pursue love; we should also pursue knowledge. At the same time, we should pursue faith and zeal so that we can please God. May God bless us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SALVATION OF<br>THE ADULTEROUS WOMAN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 40</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 4:1-15, 29</H1><P>The Scriptures we have read today record something very marvelous. The Lord preached to a most immoral woman, and this woman eventually turned to Him.</P><P>John 4:3-7 says, "He left Judea and went away again into Galilee. And He had to pass through Samaria. So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar...and Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from the journey, sat thus by the well; it was about the sixth hour. There came a woman of Samaria to draw water." Please note that about the sixth hour the woman came to draw water. When is the sixth hour? We all know it is twelve o'clock. The Lord Jesus was wearied from His journey and rested at the well. It was at that moment that a woman came to draw water.</P><P>By reading the Old Testament, we know that every time women came to draw water they always came as a group. They either came in the morning or in the late afternoon. However, in this instance it was high noon, and the weather was very hot. This woman came to draw water by herself. Did she not have any companions? Did she not have neighbors? Were there no other women that would come with her to draw water? Indeed, she had no companion or friend. Why? The latter section of this chapter tells of her history. She was a very immoral woman.</P><P>When she came to draw water, it was high noon. It was the hottest time. This woman was a lonely woman! No one would be her companion, and no one sympathized with her. In the hearts of many women, she was a sinner, a filthy woman; they could not go with her to draw water. Not only were people afraid of her, but she also was afraid of people. If she came in the morning to draw water, she was afraid someone would point to her and say, "This is a very immoral woman." If she came in the evening to draw water, she was also afraid that people would point to her and say, "This is a very defiled woman." Therefore, she had to come at high noon to draw water by herself. She was a lonely woman, despised by the world. At the same time, she also despised the world. She was a lonely woman, and no one sympathized with her. But when she came to the well to draw water this time, she met another lonely person. She was lonely and despised by people. He also was lonely and despised by people. Her loneliness was caused by her sin; His loneliness was caused by man's jealousy; He could only go back to Galilee. Oh, when the lonely sinner met the lonely Savior, she was saved.</P><P>"Jesus said to her, Give Me something to drink" (v. 7). This was an invitation for her to draw near. Many times you are afraid of God, but you are not afraid of a person who asks you for water. There are many times when you are afraid of God, but you are not afraid of God asking you for water. Many times you fear God and think that He is high and fearful. But if you know that the One who is as lonely, wearied, and sweating as you are is the very God Himself, you will believe. The Lord is here. The Lord has the affection of a friend and is very approachable.</P><P>The Samaritan woman said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?...Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" (vv. 9-10).</P><P>The Samaritan woman said this because there was no contact between the Jews and the Samaritans. The Lord answered by saying that if she knew two things, (1) the gift of God, and (2) who it was who was saying to her, "Give Me a drink," she would have asked of Him, and He would have given her living water. It is a pity that there are many people in the world who do not know these two things. Today even some among us may also not know these two things. Some sitting here may be bored, weary, or disappointed because of the burden of sin or dissatisfaction in life. The worldly road is indeed a very rugged road, and the sea of sin is indeed stormy. But if you know these two things, all will be well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE GIFT OF GOD</H2><P>God never sells anything. Gift means a present one gives to others. God's things are always given to man as gifts. As long as one wants it, it will be given to him. If someone does not want it, it will not be given to him. This is the way with everything that God gives to man. This is true not only with spiritual matters, but with material things as well. God gives us sunshine and never asks for money. The rain comes from heaven, and He never asks for money in return. It is the same when you ask for spiritual satisfaction.</P><P>Once there was a child who loved his mother very much. He wanted to buy some flowers for her to make her happy, but he only had two coins in his pocket. He saw a very beautiful garden, and he went in, thinking that he could buy some flowers. A gentleman was there, and the child told him why he had come. The man just picked a bunch of flowers and gave them to him. The boy said, "I cannot take them for free." The man responded, "My flowers are always given away. If you want them, I will give them to you." Who was that man? He was the Prince of Wales. The garden was the royal garden. The things of the royal family were never for sale. If he gives you something, you only have to receive it.</P><P>If you want satisfaction today, you can have it right away; you do not have to wait until you have completed something to get it. In writing a book, you have to spend a great deal of time preparing it. But in receiving a book, you do not have to do anything. Preparing a meal is time consuming, but eating the meal does not take much time. Preparing a dress is labor-intensive, but putting on the dress does not take much labor. If you have worries within, if your environment is oppressing you, and if you want satisfaction, you can have it right away. You do not have to do anything. He will come to you and provide for you. Oh, the gifts of God are free; He never sells anything.</P><P>When the prodigal son in Luke was hungry, "he longed to be satisfied with the carob pods which the hogs were eating, and no one gave him anything" (15:16). This is the principle of the world: when you have it, you have it; when you do not have it, you do not have it. One is just one, and two is just two. The principle of the devil is the same. In the world, if you give me something, I must give you back something. The world never gives you anything for free. Even if you have nothing, you have to give your soul away. However, there is one place that will provide things for free: the Father's house. The best thing for the prodigal son was to go home. He once said to his father, "Give me the share of the estate that falls to me. And he distributed to them his living" (15:12). Later when the son returned to his father's home, did he deserve to eat a meal? Did he deserve to have a robe? No. Everything was grace because he had spent all that he deserved to have. God's way of salvation is to give you something for free. It is not how much you give Him, but how much He gives you. Many people think that as long as they can behave well or pray more, God will grant something to them. However, this is the concept of their commercial mentality; God never acts this way.</P><P>What is the gift of God? We can read John 3:16: "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life." This gift is not gold or silver, but the Son of God. God sent His Son to die for us and laid all our sins on Him. God gives us such a Son.</P><P>I like putting John 3:16, which says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son," together with John 1:12, which says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God." John 3:16 says that God gave us His Son; John 1:12 says that we receive His Son. He gives and we receive. If there is anyone among us today who does not know how to be saved, let me tell you the way. All you have to do is receive the Son of God. One woman said that she had been doing good for more than thirty years and that she hoped that God would save her. But I can tell you that this is the tiding of woe from hell. The Bible says, "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" (Rom. 10:13). As soon as you call on Him, you will be saved. The Bible also says, "He who believes into the Son has eternal life" (John 3:36). As soon as you believe, you will be saved. This is God's gospel. If you think that you can be saved by doing good and that salvation is dependent upon good works, the whole world will perish.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE CHRIST SENT FROM GOD</H2><P>We must know not only the gift of God but also the One who says, "Give me something to drink." Today the One who is sitting by the well, who is lowly and wearied, and who has experienced so much hardship is the very gift of God. It is useless for you to merely know that God's gift is free. You must know that the Christ who is opposed by men today is the gift of God. You must know that the Jesus who is called a bastard by many is the gift of God. This Jesus who was sitting by the well, who was wearied and despised by men-the One whom men would not worship or believe in-is the gift of God. Many of those who go to hell believe in God. The first one among them is the devil; he believes that there is God. Everyone in hell believes in God, but no one believes in Jesus. This lowly Jesus, who was called a bastard, a traitor of Rome, and an imperialist, is the gift of God. If you know this Jesus, you will surely say to Him, "You are the gift of God, please give me the living water that I may be satisfied."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE WAY TO RECEIVE THE LIVING WATER</H2><P>"You would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" (John 4:10). Who can have the living water? Only those who ask. As soon as you, who are sitting here today, ask, "Please give me this living water," you will surely receive it. I have seen many people in many places who were saved just by saying, "God, save me."</P><P>The Bible records the story of a man who was a filthy publican. He would not so much as lift up his eyes unto heaven. He smote his breast saying, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner" (Luke 18:13). His prayer did not last five minutes. Even if he had uttered his words slowly, they could not have lasted for more than one minute. What did the Lord Jesus say? He said that this man went down to his house justified. In other words, this man was saved; he had eternal life.</P><P>The Gospel of Luke also tells us of a man who had murdered and committed arson all his life. He committed numerous crimes during his life. When he was caught, he was put on the cross. On the day of his execution, he saw the Lord Jesus also being crucified on the cross and joined the other robber, who was being crucified, in mocking Jesus. Later he heard the Lord's prayer on the cross and was touched. When he saw such a One there, he pleaded, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom" (23:42). How long was this prayer? Five hours? If it were five hours, he would have already died. His prayer was just to ask the Lord to remember him when He came into His kingdom. What did the Lord say? He said, "Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" (v. 43). Oh, he was saved, justified, and had eternal life.</P><P>If there is a sinner among us here today who would lift up his eyes and believe in the Word of God, he would be saved. The Lord says, "You would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water." If you would have asked, He would have given you living water. This is not our doing, but God's doing; it does not depend on our work, but on the redemptive work of the Lord; it is not what we are, but what the Lord is before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE PROBLEM OF THE WOMAN</H2><P>What did the woman do? She said, "Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water?" (v. 11). She had two concerns: (1) this man had nothing to draw with, and (2) the well was deep. She was asking, "Do You not know that the well is deep, and You have nothing to draw with? How can You get the living water?" Every unbeliever thinks, "Oh, I want to have the living water to quench my thirst, but I do not know how deep this well of living water is! How can I touch this with my hands? I want to be saved, have eternal life, and have the Holy Spirit to quench my thirst, but how far this salvation is from me! How far this eternal life is from me! How far the Holy Spirit is from me! Is there any way for me to obtain it? Oh, the well is deep, and there is no vessel! I do not know how far God is from me. I do not know how far Jesus is from me. The deeper the well is, the farther away the living water is from me. I do not know how far salvation is from me."</P><P>Some may think, "I have no way to be saved. I cannot go up to the heaven and say, `O Christ, please come down,' nor can I go down to Hades and say, `O Christ, please resurrect. ' This is so difficult. How can I be saved? Oh, salvation is but a dream, and I cannot hope for it in this life."</P><P>However, I beg you to hear God's Word: "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart...that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" (Rom. 10:8-9). What do these verses say? They say that the word is near you. Why do you say that some have to go up to heaven to bring Christ down? Why do you say that the well is deep? And why do you say that some have to go down to Hades to raise Christ from the dead? The word is near you; the well is not deep. The word is in two places: in your mouth and in your heart. Do you have a mouth? Yes. Do you have a heart? Yes. They are here, right here. The well is not deep. If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will have the living water. The water is here; it is in your mouth and in your heart. If you confess and believe, you will have it. If you said to God with your mouth, "I confess that Jesus is Lord," and if you believed in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, God would be unrighteous if you still went to hell. God cannot be unrighteous. His word says, "If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." Is not God's Word dependable?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE WATER</H2><P>"Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again" (John 4:13). I do not know if you realize what thirst is. Once a ship was about to sink, and all the people on board ran to the small lifeboat. In this small boat, there was food, but no fresh water to quench their thirst. Although water was all around, they remained thirsty. Although water was on all sides of their small boat, they were still dying of thirst. Doctors know that thirst is more intolerable than hunger. Thirst is a desire unfulfilled, a request ungranted. Someone may say, "I have a hope, but it is not fulfilled," or "I have a wish, but it has not been realized. My mouth is thirsty."</P><P>The world has many good things. But even if it gives you the best thing, you will still be thirsty. The world has many beautiful things. But even if it gives you the most beautiful thing, you will still be thirsty. The world has many great things. But even if it gives you the greatest thing, you will still be thirsty. All that the world can give to you is temporary. If you drink it, you will still be thirsty. After drinking a cup of wine, you will want more to drink. After seeing a movie, you will want to see more movies. After attending a big feast, you will desire to eat again. After gaining a reputation, you will desire to have money. After you have money, you will desire to have a good family. After you have a good family, you will desire to have good children. After you have good children, you will desire to have a long life. Once you drink what the world gives you, you will still be thirsty. If you receive something from the world, it will only make you desire more the next time. The Lord says, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again." What kind of water is "this water"? "This water" is whatever the world can give to men. "This water" is the worldly things which temporarily satisfy a person. However, the world simply creates a bigger capacity within you; it causes you to drink and still want more to drink.</P><P>There was a person whose father died for his faith during the Boxer Rebellion. He thought at one time that if someone would help him to graduate from elementary school and make twenty to thirty dollars, he would be satisfied. Later someone helped him graduate from elementary school, and he was making twenty to thirty dollars every month. But after a short while, he compared himself with others and desired to go to high school. Eventually, someone helped him finish high school. As soon as he finished high school, he desired to go to a university. Someone helped him study in a university. After graduation he wanted to study abroad. He thought that if he could get a Ph.D. degree, he would be satisfied and have no other desire. Again someone helped him, and he was able to study abroad. Eventually, he also received his Ph.D. degree. He came back to China and became a university professor. But he said, "Someone with a Ph.D. is not necessarily happier than an elementary school graduate." One day he was satisfied; he received the Christ that his father had died for. He now works for the Lord and is no longer thirsty.</P><P>Some may think that as long as they can gain something in school or in business, they will be satisfied. But I must tell you that even if you gain something it will only be a temporary satisfaction; it cannot quench your thirst. Those sitting here may have some desires and strong cravings to be satisfied. You may have a dream before you. But I must tell you that even if your dream comes true and your desires are fulfilled, you will not be satisfied; you will still dream and still say that there is a place within that is not yet satisfied. Friends, may we see that all things are vanity and will not quench our thirst after we drink them.</P><P>I had a friend who grew up in the same place as I did. He went through college and was the Chief of Police for one term. After he believed in the Lord, he went to testify to one of his former colleagues, a military person who had some power. When his colleague saw him with a plain cloth gown, he asked, "Are you happy?" He said, "Just look at me, and you will know that I am happy." His colleague said, "What about your wife and children?" He answered, "The Lord Jesus is the One thinking about them; He is the Lord." The colleague said, "Have you ever thought about what you will do for the rest of your life?" He said, "God is responsible for me for the rest of my life." His colleague marveled at him. Here was a person who had gone through college and had been the Chief of Police. After he had believed in the Lord, there was a peace within him which others did not have. When he departed, his old friend said to him, "I wish that I could drop all I have to get what you have." No political power can satisfy man, nor can an excellent position satisfy man. If there is any friend here who is not yet satisfied, I must tell you that everyone who drinks of the worldly water will thirst again. The worldly water can never satisfy you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE LIVING WATER</H2><P>If anyone among us would like to be satisfied, I can tell you the way. The Lord Jesus said, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" (v. 14). You will never thirst after you drink the water that the Lord gives you because the water will become a spring of water gushing up. Will this satisfy you for three or five days only? No, it will spring up into eternal life. This is what the Lord will give to us. Whatever comes from outside is of no use because anything that comes in from outside cannot satisfy us. Once you receive Christ, He will be in you a spring so that you will be satisfied every day. What we lack is the inward satisfaction.</P><P>One day someone went to a doctor and said to him, "I have lost all taste to live. I have lost all hope. What is wrong with me?" The doctor examined him and said, "You do not have any illness." He asked, "What shall I do?" The doctor answered, "You should look for some pleasures. Perhaps you should watch a comedy show more often. A comedian can make people laugh and be happy." The patient said, "I am a comedian. Although I can make other people laugh, I cannot make myself laugh." This is all that the world can offer to men.</P><P>Why is it that in the church someone can lose everything and still be happy? It is not because he had a good outward environment or that he lived a good life materially. It is because he has something satisfying within him-Christ. Some missionaries went to isolated islands to live with the natives. Sometimes they only received one letter from the outside world in a year. They should have suffered more loneliness than lighthouse keepers. How could they be happy? They could be happy because there was something within them which caused them to sing and say, "Hallelujah!" Although I do not know music, I want to sing; even though I cannot sing, I want to say, "Hallelujah!" I have said before that we do not love the world because we have lost our taste for it or because we are disenchanted with the world, like some old folks who no longer enjoy the worldly blessings because they have lived long in this world. Christians overcome the world because they have drunk enough and are full. What are the worldly things worth? Since Christ has satisfied our heart, we have left the world behind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE WOMAN SATISFIED</H2><P>"The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw" (v. 15). When the woman began to ask the Lord, did she understand what she was asking? She understood nothing at all. Even though she did not understand anything, did the Lord answer her request? He had to answer because He had said, "You would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water" (v. 10). Mr. Wilkes said, "The woman just asked once, and she received." This is true. Jesus did not say that one will have something when he understands in his mind. Rather, when one asks, according to the Lord's word, He has to give it to him.</P><P>"Then the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city, and said to the people, Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ?" (vv. 28-29). "Is this not" surely means that it is. Whenever a sentence begins with "is it not," the answer is surely affirmative. This shows that she had obtained the gift. Although she did not understand and did not know what she was asking for, she recognized that this man was the Christ. She was satisfied. Today many are weary and thirsty. But as soon as you believe in Him and ask Him, you will be satisfied.</P><P>Mr. Wilkes told of a story. A naval vessel was once anchored at a certain place. Several sailors went ashore to listen to the preaching of some women missionaries. One of them heard and believed. After returning to the ship, he prayed on his knees beside his bed at night. The sailor's nickname was "Old Seventy." Among the sailors, he liked to play tricks and joke with others the most. When he knelt down and prayed, his companions said, "Look! Old Seventy is playing new tricks again; he is mimicking a praying Christian." They threw shoes on his head and mocked him one by one. He did not pay any attention to them. They said, "Look, Old Seventy is really acting well." He stood up and told them, "I have believed in Jesus." They did not believe him and said, "You are really acting well." The next day, Old Seventy met a half-converted Christian and told him, "I have believed in Jesus." The man said, "Once a man believes in Jesus, he must feel peaceful and happy like being in heaven. Do you feel this way now that you have believed in Jesus?" He said, "I do not have those feelings." The man said, "Then your faith is not trustworthy." He went to see the women missionaries quickly and said to them, "You told me that once a man believes in Jesus, he is saved. This is not right because when others believe in Jesus, they feel peaceful and happy within. Why do I not have those feelings at all?" One missionary said, "I do not ask if you feel different or not; I only ask if there is any change in you." He pondered and stopped for a while. Then he jumped up and said, "Yes, there is a difference. I used to make fun of others more than any of the other sailors on the ship. They could joke, but I could joke better. However, when I believed in Jesus and went back to the ship, I heard my companions' talk and felt that their words were very offensive and filthy. I worried about what would happen to them because of what they said. Before it would have been a wonder if I did not fight them all. I would have been in a rage when they threw their shoes at me like they did last night. But I was not mad at all last night. On the contrary, I pitied them and felt sorry for their ignorance." The Western missionary said, "Good! It is not important whether or not you feel different; as long as you are changed, that is good enough."</P><P>O friends, the Lord Jesus can satisfy your heart and quench your desire for anything in the world. If you are willing to say to the Lord today, "Lord, I believe in You; I give myself to You," you will be saved. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the Lord's words shall not pass away. It is not important whether or not you can feel it. If you believe, it is enough. Believe first, and then the feelings will follow. You do not feel first and then believe. Peace and joy come after one believes. One does not believe after he has peace and joy.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WIDOW, THE WIFE, AND THE VIRGIN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 41</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 18:3; Rev. 18:7; 17:1; Rom. 7:2-4; 2 Cor. 11:2-3</H1><P>The verses today tell us that the church or Christians have three kinds of circumstances before God. Before speaking about these three circumstances, I want to relate one thing first: there is a line from Genesis to Revelation of women being used by God to typify His children, His people. In the verses which I have read today, God likens His children to women. In one case He likens them to a widow; in another case He likens them to a wife; in the third case He likens them to a virgin. Every Christian who lives in the world is a widow, a wife, and also a virgin. In the world, there are great differences between a widow, wife, and virgin. Yet in the Bible, Luke says that a Christian takes the position of a widow (18:3), Romans 7 says that a Christian takes the position of a wife (vv. 2-4), and 2 Corinthians 11 says that a Christian takes the position of a virgin (vv. 2-3).</P><P>Every Christian is a widow towards the world. At the same time, he is a wife with respect to the enjoyment of the riches of Christ, and a virgin with respect to his restriction for the sake of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. WIDOW</H2><P>"And there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, Avenge me of my opponent" (Luke 18:3).</P><P>"As much as she has glorified herself and lived luxuriously, as much torment and sorrow give to her; for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and I am not a widow, and I shall by no means see sorrow" (Rev. 18:7).</P><P>"And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters" (Rev. 17:1).</P><P>One thing that moves my heart very much is that on earth today, our heart is a widow's heart! We do not love the world because the world is not attractive or because the Bible forbids us. It is not because the world and the lusts of it will pass away. The world is lovely, and the things, objects, and people of the world are lovely. Although the Bible has sixty-six books, only one book, Ecclesiastes, says that all things are vanity under the sun. A Christian does not love the world because the world is vain, but because our Lord was crucified in the world. Consequently, our heart is a widow's heart.</P><P>If the one you love is in a certain place, the place becomes lovely. The place where he is becomes paradise to you. But since He is not here, our heart is a widow's heart. This world has become a void to us. We are not attracted by the world because the world is unattractive. It is comfortable and pleasurable to dress and eat well. But if our heart is drawn to the One we love, all these things will become nothing to us. Since He is not here, our world has become bitter. If a woman can still dress and eat well after her beloved husband passes away, those around her may criticize her, saying, "What kind of a heart does she have!" Is it wrong for her to dress well and eat well? It is not wrong, but since her husband is not here anymore, her heart should no longer care for these things. It is not that these things lose their taste in themselves, but they no longer have the same taste within her. It is not that the world has become more unattractive, but that we do not have a heart to love it anymore.</P><P>Among the vast sea of humanity, I feel lonely because He is not here. When I am alone, my heart is on fire because I think of Him. When I walk by the seashore, see the waves, and hear the sound of the tides, I do not feel lonely or isolated because He comforts me. Brothers and sisters, there may be many things in the world which can attract you, but if the Lord fills your heart, all those things will be counted as nothing.</P><P>When He was in the world, He was killed by men. He left only a cross and an empty grave. Our Lord has died; therefore, we are widows. It is not that the world is evil or unattractive, but that He is not here. Brothers and sisters, we are truly widows in this world. Our Lord is not on this earth anymore. As a result, the world can no longer attract us. If there is a brother or a sister who feels no need for the Lord to satisfy their heart, I do not know what kind of heart they have. In Luke 18 the Lord says, "And there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, Avenge me of my opponent." Our condition in this world is that of a widow, one who is being ridiculed and insulted by others.</P><P>In Revelation 18 Babylon typifies the fallen church. She says in her heart, "I sit a queen, and I am not a widow, and I shall by no means see sorrow." Only fallen ones do not consider themselves as a widow. Whenever you become fallen, you will lose the characteristics of a widow. Oh, if we want to serve the Lord faithfully in this world, we have to be a widow with respect to the world. We have to maintain a widow's attitude toward the world daily. Once the disciples of John came to Jesus, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?" (Matt. 9:14). Jesus said unto them, "The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the Bridegroom is with them, can they? But days will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast" (v. 15). Oh, today He is no longer here. This is the time for us to fast. Are we fasting with respect to the world? This earth is not our home; we have no happiness on this earth because He is not here.</P><P>Today the bread of the Lord's table tells us that He is not here. The cup also tells us that He is not here. The bread tells us that He was killed. The cup tells us that His blood was shed. Because He is not here, our heart is not here. What can replace Him in our heart? Nothing can replace Him. We want to be free from the world because the One we love is not here, not because the world is unattractive. For where our treasure is, there our heart is. Since my treasure is not here, my heart is not here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WIFE</H2><P>"For the married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband. So then if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to another man. So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead (pay attention to this phrase), that we might bear fruit to God" (Rom. 7:2-4).</P><P>The Bible not only tells us that we are a widow in the world; Romans 7 also says that every Christian is like a wife. I wonder if we know the difference between a widow and a wife. A widow does not have a husband; she has nothing to rely on. A wife has a husband and someone to rely on. Who should bear a family's financial responsibility? It is the husband, not the wife. It is not normal for a husband to rely on his wife to support the family. A widow has lost her support in the world. A wife, however, receives all of her supply from her husband. Brothers and sisters, do you know that our relationship with Christ is one of a husband and a wife? All our needs are supplied by Him. We do not have to worry about how we can receive our supply for the month. We can receive all of our supply from Christ. We may have a bad temper. We may be proud and cannot forgive others. We may be weak in our work and have no burden to pray or any taste for the Word. But, brothers and sisters, let me say that all these problems can be solved by Christ. Through the power of His resurrection, we can bear fruit.</P><P>It is a universal custom that as soon as a woman is married, she immediately uses her husband's name. I wonder who can use Brother Chang's name. Not his brothers, his children, or even his parents can use his name. Only his wife can have the same name. Many Christians do not see the preciousness in the words "in My name." We do not realize how much blessing there is in the phrase "in My name." We can receive whatever we ask in His name. We can cast out demons in His name, anoint patients in His name, forgive sins in His name, and preach in His name. What does this mean? Who can use the Lord's name? Some may think that when they cast out demons, all they have to do is say the Lord's name, and the demons will be chased away. Others may think the name is used only as a formality when they perform baptism. Let me ask: Can we go to the bank and draw money in the name of Brother Chang? This name is his, not ours. We can only use our name. But praise and thank God that every Christian can do things in the Lord's name because we belong to Him, and all that He has is ours. He is the Christ, and we are His people. Brothers and sisters, every Christian has the right to use His name. The day we believed in the Lord, we were united with Him. Therefore, His name is ours. This is why we can pray in His name. We can do things in His name because we have been joined to His resurrection. There is nothing that we cannot acquire from God. Just as a husband loves, cherishes, supplies, and supports his own wife, Christ does the same for us. Let us remember that with respect to the riches of Christ, we are not a widow, but a wife.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. VIRGIN</H2><P>"For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts would be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity toward Christ" (2 Cor. 11:2-3).</P><P>The Bible not only tells us that our attitude toward the world is one of a widow, and that our position with respect to the riches of Christ is that of a wife, but it also tells us that in waiting for the Lord's return, we are a virgin. This means that we need to keep ourselves chaste while waiting for His return. Paul said, "For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God." We know the meaning of jealousy. Because of Christ, Paul was jealous over the fact that some others had won their hearts. We belong to the Lord, and no one should snatch us away. Suppose I have a friend who is engaged to a girl. While he is away, his fiancee turns her love to someone else. As his friend, I would surely become jealous. She should not have done this to my friend. For my friend's sake, I would become jealous over the fact that someone has taken away her heart.</P><P>Paul was afraid that their hearts would be corrupted from the simplicity and purity toward Christ, just as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness. Every Christian should have an undefiled heart, one that has not been touched by anyone else. Let us check ourselves today before God and see if we have lost the simplicity and purity toward Christ. If there is a believer whose desire is not Christ but his own enjoyment, his Lord will not be pleased.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, today we need to say, "Lord, I am Yours. May You preserve my garment, my heart, my thoughts, and my everything as undefiled and pure. Oh, may I be touched by nothing." This is like the words in the Song of Songs, which say, "A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed" (4:12). The words "inclosed" and "sealed" are used again and again because no one should get into our garden. Our garden is opened to our Beloved only. None can draw water from us and be satisfied. None can draw water from us and quench his thirst. The well and the spring within us are kept for Him. Brothers and sisters, day by day we ought to maintain such an attitude. We are for the Lord, and no one should touch us. Paul said, "Henceforth let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus" (Gal. 6:17). Oh, we bear the marks of the cross, and no one should trouble us anymore.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD SEARCHING MEN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 41</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 3:11-12; Luke 19:10</H1><P>We thank and praise God. It is not we who first love God, but God who first loves us. According to Romans 3:11-12, no one seeks after God. According to Luke 19:10, the Son of Man came to seek and save those who were lost. We thank and praise God that He does not require us to bring to Him cows and sheep, like the people in the Old Testament age, in order to meet Him. Rather, He tabernacled among us through His Son so that we could draw near to Him.</P><P>Today in front of this table of grace, none of us dares say that we intended to be saved and seek after God. I have done some work among unbelievers. Among those whom I have met, I have never seen anyone who seeks after God. Mr. Paget Wilkes said that he had preached to tens of thousands of people in Japan, but that he had never met one who was really seeking God.</P><P>A slogan that said, "China returns to Christ," was translated into English as "China for Christ." This is something from hell. Only Christ is for China. There is no one in the world who is for Christ; only Christ is for man. This is grace, and this is the gospel. What about the idol worshippers? Are they not seeking after God? No. They worship only for their own self-interest. Some desire to be prosperous in their business or safe and secure with their family. They are only after blessings. Man seeks after what God has, not God Himself. God is after us, the persons. Man seeks after God's grace, peace, and prosperity. God is not after what we have, but what we are. Today in the presence of God, we ought to utter our praise and thanksgiving. How good our God has been to us! The goodness that He has shown to us is beyond what we could ever think!</P><P>Second Corinthians 8:5 says, "And this, not as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God." Do you see this? God wants us, the persons. In God there is no covetousness. Does He want the money of wealthy men? No, God is after us. No one seeks after God. Man only wants God's blessing and peace. But God is after us. Even though man never seeks for God, He seeks us.</P><P>If God wants something from us, we have nothing to give to Him. God only wants us. If a man is saved, that is good enough. God wants man and saves man. Prior to our salvation, we lived in a world without a Savior, and we never gave any thought to eternal life or the future. Perhaps we heard of God, but we did not want Him. Perhaps we heard of God, but we still hated Him. But we thank and praise God; He has saved us! Today this bread and this cup tell us that God sent His Son to the world to seek us because He loved us. Then His Son gave up His life and shed His blood to save us!</P><P>We do not start out as prodigal sons. Rather, we start out as lost sheep. The shepherd first came to look for the sheep. There are three parables in Luke 15: a shepherd searching for his lost sheep, a woman seeking for a lost coin, and a father receiving a prodigal son. First, a Savior went out to seek for us, then the Holy Spirit shined on us. Finally, the Father received us. Thank and praise God; He sought out and saved us!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE OTHER ASPECT<br>OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 42</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Lev. 6:1-7</H1><P>Today we want to read carefully before God this portion of the Scripture which talks about the trespass offering. The trespass offering is very important in the Bible. Altogether there are five offerings spoken of in Leviticus 1-6. These five offerings typify the five aspects of our Lord Jesus' offering of Himself as an offering. Jesus Christ is one offering; however, viewed from our side, this offering has five aspects. Our view can only be complete with these five aspects. If only one is used to typify the Lord, our view will not be complete. There need to be five offerings to typify the Lord. Therefore, these five offerings are very important.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RELATIONSHIP<br>BETWEEN THE TRESPASS OFFERING<br>AND THE OTHER FOUR OFFERINGS</H2><P>What relationship does the trespass offering have with the other four offerings? In order to answer this, we need to consider the four offerings. Then we will talk about the trespass offering. We need to understand the offerings one by one. In this way we will not over-emphasize the trespass offering.</P><P>First, the burnt offering typifies our Lord's offering His whole being to God. This is very important. This offering is not for the propitiation of sin. However, if the Lord did not offer Himself absolutely to God, He could not propitiate our sins.</P><P>Second, the meal offering, which has no blood, typifies the Lord's living; His living in this world was very pure. Flour can be food for man. Our Lord lived before God in a very pure and fine way. This offering emphasizes His perfection. We can say that He was a perfect man.</P><P>Third, the peace offering signifies that the Lord has accomplished peace between God and man. This not only enabled God to be at peace with us, but it also enabled us to be at peace with God.</P><P>Fourth, the sin offering typifies the Lord's propitiation of our sin, enabling us to be reconciled with God. The Lord propitiated our sin so that we could be saved through His blood.</P><P>The fifth offering is the trespass offering. Some may ask what the difference between the sin and trespass offering is. Sin denotes our sin generally; this is the sin before God. Trespasses are the individual sins we commit day by day; they can be counted. We may say that the sin offering is for all of our sins, the totality of sin, while the trespass offering is for our particular sins which can be counted.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO PARTS OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING</H2><P>The trespass offering is divided into two parts. One part is recorded in Leviticus 5; the other part is recorded in Leviticus 6. Chapter five talks about what we must do before God day by day when we sin against Him. Chapter six talks about what we must do before man day by day when we sin against man. I am not going to speak on chapter five. Rather, I want to speak on chapter six, that is, on what we must do if we sin against man in certain areas after we were saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING</H2><P>I am not saying that this offering can bring salvation to a man. After we have the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, and the sin offering, we are saved and have life. The trespass offering mentioned in chapters five and six speaks of our fellowship with God. Receiving life is one thing; having fellowship with God is another. When you believe that Christ died for you and receive the Lord as your Savior, you have life. But this does not mean that from now on you will never lose your fellowship with God. The minute you were saved, you began to have fellowship with God. After you are saved, however, if you sin again and do not repent, you will lose your fellowship with God. You will feel that God is very far from you and that it is very difficult to pray and very hard to read the Bible. This does not mean that you have become unsaved again. Once a person believes, he is saved; this can never be changed. But his fellowship with God may change. If you have sinned and do not deal with it, you will lose your fellowship with Him. Many people are saved, but they cannot freely pray, and they find it difficult to read the Bible. The reason may be that their daily trespasses have not been dealt with properly.</P><P>At the time we were saved, we surely had a kind of joy; it was the joy of salvation. We wished that we could tell everyone about our salvation. How joyful we were. Unfortunately, this joy did not last very long. How was this joy lost? Perhaps we said some harsh words and offended someone. We became ashamed to face God. We sinned against man, but lost our joy. We sinned against man, but we lost our fellowship with God.</P><P>Today we must learn the lesson that a person should not remain merely saved, but should learn day by day to pray well, read the Bible well, testify well, and maintain a living fellowship with God. A man may lose his fellowship, but he can never lose his salvation. "They shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand" (John 10:28-29). This is what our Lord has said. Eternal life can never be lost; life can never be lost. But the one thing that can be lost, perhaps more than ten times a day, is our fellowship with God.</P><P>Suppose a father tells his son to be good and not do certain things. If the son opens the cabinet, steals a piece of candy, and eats it, or if he soils his clothes, or if he plays with bad children, he will be somewhat afraid to see his father when he hears him calling. They are still father and son. But since he has done something which displeases his father, he dares not see his father right away. When he hears his father calling, his little heart jumps because he knows that something has gone wrong between him and his father. He will think that he cannot face his father when his clothes are soiled or his toys are ruined. He dares not see his father's face. But does this mean that he is no longer his father's son? This can never happen. The relationship of the father to the son can never change; it is the fellowship between the father and son that changes. The Father and son relationship that we have with God and the relationship in life can never be lost because of some change in our daily living. However, one thing can be lost: our daily fellowship with God.</P><P>The trespass offering is to bring us back into fellowship with God. The sin offering is to bring a sinner into believing in the Lord Jesus, while the trespass offering is to bring a Christian into fellowship with God. The sin offering removed our sin when we were unbelievers; the trespass offering removes the sins which hinder our daily fellowship with God. One gives us life, and the other gives us fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRESPASS OFFERING<br>WITH RESPECT TO OFFENSES TOWARD MEN</H2><P>I have already said that the trespass offering consists of two parts. One part concerns an offense toward God. This is covered in Leviticus 5. The other part concerns an offense toward man. This is covered in Leviticus 6. I want to speak on what to do when we have offended man. This is the subject of chapter six. Today's topic can be called, "What we must do if we have lost our fellowship with God due to our offense against others." We must remember that chapter six is not on salvation and receiving life, but on our fellowship with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SOME SINS AGAINST MAN</H2><P>Verse 1 says, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses." This tells us that what follows is from God and not from Moses. Let us see which sins, according to God, are against man. It seems as if God has put together a list which shows various kinds of trespasses. At the bottom of the list, a total of all these trespasses is given.</P><P>Verse 2 says, "When a person sins and acts unfaithfully against Jehovah..." Since the following trespasses are all against man, why does it say that they are against the Lord? When a person sins against a man, he also sins against God. God is the Creator, and every human being is created by Him. Therefore, offending man is the same as offending God. Let us now consider some of the trespasses against man:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Unfaithful to What Was Entrusted</H2><P>Verse 2 says, "Lies to his fellowman in regard to a deposit." This sin will cause us to lose our fellowship with God. Brothers, has anyone delivered something to us to keep? Once when I went home to Foochow, someone asked me to bring some mangoes to my second aunt. But mangoes rot easily. Although I tried to prevent them from rotting, some still changed color and had almost become rotten. I thought that since all of them might be rotten by the time I arrived home, why not give them away to the people on the boat? So I selected three of the greenest ones, kept them, and gave the rest away. As I came closer to home, my heart felt a little uneasy. This was being unfaithful in the thing delivered to me by my neighbor. The mangoes were not mine. Regardless of being good or rotten, I had to bring them to my second aunt. I felt a little ashamed explaining this to my aunt, but I could not let it go unexplained because that would be unrighteousness. Finally, I cleared the matter up.</P><P>If someone entrusts fifty dollars to us, we may be faithful to it. But if someone entrusts fifty cents to us, we may not be truthful about it. Since the amount is small, we may think that it is unimportant. But this is deceitful; it is a sin which will cause us to lose our fellowship with God. Perhaps someone entrusts a letter to us to deliver. Even if we do not open the letter and read it, we sometimes like to look at the outside. It is all right if we unintentionally glance at it; but if we have the intention to pry into others' secrets, we are wrong. This matter will hinder our real and intimate fellowship with God. I am afraid that the reason many people cannot read the Bible well is that they have sins which are not properly dealt with. If we are careless and do not deal with such sins, we will not be able to fellowship with God freely.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Lying in Business</H2><P>Verse 2 says, "Lies to his fellowman in regard to...a security." The previous case is general. This case is not general; it is very specific. This is to sin in business. However, this is not directed only at those who are in business, but to every brother and sister. Not only can businessmen commit this sin, every brother and sister can commit this sin as well. I heard that once a mother with her three sons was sitting on a bus. When the bus conductor came to collect the fares, the mother told one of her sons to give the conductor seventy cents. Four tickets should cost seventy-two cents, but she paid only seventy cents. She kept back two cents. This was not dishonesty on the part of the conductor, but dishonesty on the part of the one who purchased the tickets. Sometimes a person rides on a tram and passes three stations beyond his destination. Should he pay according to his original destination, or according to the station that he finally gets off at? He may think that it is better for him to profit than for the tram conductor to profit, and he may decide not to pay for the three stations. This is unrighteousness. The tram conductor may cheat, but how can a Christian cheat? As a Christian, he cannot allow these things to carelessly occur. Sometimes when we buy things, others may give us twenty cents more for change. If we do not return it, we are not honest. If we covet the extra twenty cents, we are delighting in sin. These are very small matters, but we should not let them pass lightly.</P><P>Some brothers say that without lying, one cannot be successful in business. But I tell you that we must conduct our business in honesty. We may suffer in the beginning, but eventually we will come out on top. This is what many brothers have told me. We do not have to lie, and we must not lie. If we lie intentionally in our business, we will lose our fellowship with God. We must deal with this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Robbing</H2><P>Verse 2 says, "Or through robbery." Robbing, taking things away by violence, and usurping belong to the same kind of sin. To gain by force or to gain by improper means is to rob. Suppose someone asks you to be the executor of a will. After he dies, are you going to execute his will, or are you going to keep some for yourself? He has died, and the things are in your hands. If you willfully change the will, this is robbing. Some may have been soldiers or may have worked in the customs office. If you have used improper means to gain some possessions, this is robbing.</P><P>It is a fact that one receives life by believing in the Lord. It is also a fact that everyone who is saved through the blood of the Lord has his sins forgiven before God. However, when you sin against someone, God cannot forgive you on that person's behalf. For example, if I offend Brother Wang and I confess before God, God cannot forgive me on behalf of Brother Wang. If you offend man and do not deal with it properly, this sin will not cause you to lose your life, but it will cause you to lose your fellowship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Deceiving One's Fellowman</H2><P>Verse 2 says, "Extorted from his fellowman." "Fellowman" in the Old Testament denotes other people; it does not necessarily mean the person next door. This is a kind of Jewish idiomatic expression. The fellowman denotes other people. How many mothers-in-law have deceived their daughters-in-law? How many parents have deceived their children? How many teachers have deceived their pupils? How many in high positions have deceived those under them? All of these are deceiving their fellowman, and all these matters displease God. None of us can act foolishly or live our lives foolishly. We must deal with these matters. Many are harsh husbands, harsh wives, or harsh mothers. Many mothers use improper ways to deceive their children. In our daily life, we deceive others in many ways. We often speak words that deceive others on the street. We often resort to force with the cab drivers or rickshaw drivers. We often are too harsh in dealing with others. These all deceive our fellowman. Servants and drivers were all created by God, and we cannot treat them in a harsh way. Very often they may be wrong and unreasonable. But do they have your kind of background? Do they have your kind of position? Do they have your kind of education? They do not have your background, position, and education. How can you expect them to be as reasonable as you are? Even if they are wrong, you do not have to oppress them. Christians ought not to be unrighteous toward others. For Christians to deceive others is displeasing to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. Taking What Others Have Lost</H2><P>Verse 3 says, "Or has found what was lost and lied about it." We may think that this matter is not very important, but this is deceitful. We may think that picking up things left behind by others is not unrighteous. But God says that this is deceitful. No Christian can claim what others have lost as his own. If we are on a tram and we see others deceiving, that is not our business. We cannot control them. We have no way to change the morals of society; the Lord will take care of it when He comes. Many pick up money and put it into their own pocket because they are afraid that the money would otherwise go into someone else's pocket. This is unrighteousness. Once I saw a man counting coins in a tram, and he dropped one. Another man stepped on the coin so that the owner would not see it. When the owner got off the tram, the other man also got off. I do not know if he paid the fare for the two additional stops just to get that one coin.</P><P>Whether it is a handkerchief, hat, fountain pen, or someone's letter, anything that is left on the street can never be claimed as our own. This is unrighteousness. In the past we may have picked up others' possessions. But whether it is money or objects, something big or small, as long as it is not ours, we cannot have it as our possession. If at all possible, we must return it. When we see something left on the street, we should wait for the owner to come and find it, or we should hand it to the local officials. Otherwise, God will say we have sinned.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>6. Swearing Falsely</H2><P>Verse 3 says, "And has sworn falsely." Swearing has two aspects in the original language. One is in the context of the previous trespass, and the other is independent of it. In the context of the previous trespass, it means that when after picking up another's thing and being caught and questioned, one lies and swears that he has not picked it up and that if he had, he would have done such and such. It is wrong for you to pick up another's thing and to lie and swear that you did not do it. This is condemned by God. We can never lie this way to avoid trouble.</P><P>Generally speaking, lying is a way of avoiding being blamed for sin. I have said that there are three big reasons for lying. One reason is pride. Lying may keep one's pride intact. After one has done something wrong and people ask him about it, he either says that he did not do it or says something else to cover it up in order to save his face. Another reason for lying is that one fears that others may become too strict toward him. An overly strict mother will have lying children. An overly strict teacher will have lying pupils. An overly strict master will have lying servants. Being too strict will cause others to lie. If you can tolerate the mistakes of others, they may be willing to tell you the truth. But if you have a whip in your hand and cannot forgive the smallest matter, others cannot help but lie because lying may help them avoid difficulty and save them. The third reason for lying is what we have been speaking about today, that is, lying in order to gain profit. If I can gain one hundred dollars by just a little lie, why should I not lie? It is possible to gain some benefit or money by lying. Some lie because of pride; some lie because others are too strict. These are lesser sins. But lying in order to gain a profit is a more serious sin. God condemns any lie that is done for profit. Lying is condemned already; but lying for profit is condemned even more.</P><P>Some who work as nurses may take some cotton swatches and medicine from the hospital. Their intention may be to bring them home for their own use. But when the pharmacist asks them what they are doing, they may say that these are for their patients. They may be successful in taking those things, but this is lying for profit. It is very easy for us to acquire things that belong to the government by way of lying. This is wrong. As Christians, we cannot do this. I have no objection to man giving you something or allowing you to take something. If others have the authority to give something to you, I have no objection.</P><P>Some may be working in an organization where everyone is allotted papers, envelopes, pencils, etc. If you conserve some of them and give them to your children, that is all right because they are your portion. But if you tell the one allotting the stationery that you do not have enough and need more, it is a sin. You are profiting by improper means, and this is not pleasing to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THE TRESPASSES</H2><P>If we have committed these trespasses, what shall we do? The following verses tell us what to do in our practice. Once we realize that there is sin, we should deal with it.</P><P>Verse 4 says, "When he sins and is guilty." Sinning is an act, while being guilty is something before God; it is having a case of sin before God. We can see what needs to be done when there is a case of sin from the following verses.</P><P>Verse 4 continues, and verse 5 says, "He shall return what he took by robbery, or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was deposited with him, or the lost thing which he found, or anything about which he swore falsely; he shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more; he shall give it to whom it belongs on the day he is found guilty." The most important command is first to restore and give the things back to others. Whatever is not yours can no longer remain in your house. If a Christian is not clean, one cannot blame society for being unclean. If a Christian covets others' possessions, one cannot blame many government officials for coveting others' possessions. If a Christian is loath to part with the things which he has obtained, one cannot blame others for being loath to part with the things they have obtained. Every Christian has to be clean. If at all possible, we have to repay others and confess to others.</P><P>There is one main difference between the sin offering and the trespass offering. The sin offering is to "propitiate," and the trespass offering is to "repay." We cannot repay God for our offenses against Him; neither can we propitiate our offenses against men. We have sinned and can only be propitiated to God by the Lord's blood. When we have offended others, we cannot propitiate, but we must repay. If we are not faithful to what others have entrusted to us, or if we have gained something by base means, we have to repay others. If we are not willing to repay others, we cannot offer the trespass offering. By the blood of the Lord Jesus, we can receive forgiveness from God for our sins. This is the truth. However, if we have offended others and are not willing to deal with the offenses, we will lose our fellowship with God. Whenever we think about it, we will feel bound, uneasy in our conscience, and that we are unable to fellowship with God.</P><P>The meetings at Keswick started fifty-one years ago. Once Mr. F.B. Meyer was invited to speak. What did Mr. Meyer say in his first message? He said, "If we expect God to bless and revive us, we must first take care of things properly. If there is any bill still being kept in your house that you have not paid, you should not expect any blessing or revival." There may be a bill of ten dollars in your house that has not been paid for a long time. Bringing a lawsuit against you is too much, but ignoring it will mean that the bill will remain with you forever. After Mr. Meyer said this, the result was immediate. The next day, all the money orders at the Keswick post office were sold out. From this, we can see how many unrighteous Christians there are.</P><P>Many can say, "I have never killed anyone, and I have not set fire to anyone's house." But to take a little advantage of others can cause us to lose our fellowship with God. The blood of Christ will only wash us of our sins and wash our conscience; it will not wash our heart. Only after we have dealt with all our earthly relationships will our heart be washed clean.</P><P>Some things are harder than others to deal with. Many people have their assets built on unrighteousness. If these are not dealt with clearly, they cannot have good fellowship with God. These things will hold them back from further advance. If there is anyone whose assets are built on unrighteousness, if at all possible, they should give all these things back to others today. If at all possible, they should settle these things properly. Of course, if it is not possible, God will still accept their heart. There was a brother who owed others tens of thousands of dollars. He had acquired the money by illegal means and later spent almost all of it. At this time he had only three or four thousand dollars left. He had a few children to feed, and he asked me what he should do. I said to him, "If you had fifty thousand dollars in the bank, what would you do? If you had fifty thousand dollars and did not want to repay what you owed, it would be a different story because then it would not be a matter of not having the money, but a matter of not being willing to repay the money. However, God will not let you go. If there is an accusation in your conscience, you will not have peace. In this case you should return to the others what little you have." We would rather be poor and peaceful in our conscience. If we do not deal with our sins clearly, all our energy will be wasted away.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ADDING THE FIFTH PART</H2><P>Verse 5 says, "He shall make restitution for it in full and add to it one-fifth more." For example, if we owe someone five dollars, we have to repay him six dollars. This extra dollar is counted as the interest. The fifth part must be added when we restore to others all that we have taken advantage of them in. This includes all money and materials gained by improper means. This additional fifth part is to compensate for the loss suffered by others. When we pay others back, it is not too much to give a little extra. When we restore things to others, we should not restore just the exact amount. We should always give a little extra; otherwise, we may shortchange others. This is a most important principle. Suppose I apologize to Brother Wang after I have an argument with him, and I say, "I should not have argued with you today; I did not behave like a Christian. However, you should not have argued with me either." I confess, but that confession can only be considered a restoring of the principal; it is exact accounting. This kind of confession does not have the fifth part added. When we confess, it does no harm to confess a little more. Not only should we restore the principal, but we should add the extra fifth part. This is a principle. We should extend the limit a little. If we are still complaining about others when we confess, this means we still have hatred in our heart. We should only confess our own sins, and we should not implicate others when we confess. We should add an extra fifth part to God's ordination. It is not enough to confess five- fifths; we have to confess six-fifths. If we are going to confess, we have to extend the boundary a little further.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TIME OF REPAYING</H2><P>Verse 5 says, "He shall make restitution for it in full...on the day he is found guilty." This tells us that we should give back on the same day as our trespass offering and not wait any longer. Once we are clear about something, there is no need to wait for the Holy Spirit to move us anymore; the Holy Spirit has already moved us and made known to us our trespass. We need not wait; we should make restitution immediately. If we delay in our restitution, there may be two undesirable consequences. First, our conscience may become more and more quiet. It is precious to have the conscience speak again and again; it is terrible to be without its speaking. Second, the condemnation of our conscience may become more and more acute, so that we become unable to open our mouth before others. Then we cannot preach and have no peace at all. If we know about our trespasses and delay and wait, there surely will be these two consequences.</P><P>Therefore, if we have offended someone, we have to deal with the matter clearly. If we have shortchanged someone or gained things by unrighteous means, we have to give them back and settle the matters properly. We should never be deceived to think that we only need to confess to God when we offend others, and that there is no need to confess to men. This is absolutely wrong. God can forgive us because of the Lord's blood, but God cannot forgive us on behalf of others. We have to repay the same day. Whenever it becomes known to us, that is the time to take care of it. If we wait one or two days, we will find that we have less power to do it. Doing this requires strength, and today is when the strength is most available.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OFFERING<br>OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING</H2><P>Verse 6 says, "Then he shall bring to the priest his trespass offering to Jehovah, a ram without blemish from the flock, according to the valuation, for a trespass offering." This is the second thing that needs to be done. Even though we have paid others back, there is still one more thing we need to do. Even if we have paid others back, it will not bring us forgiveness before God. We still have to offer up the trespass offering. No one in the world can be forgiven just by confessing. If we have offended God, we can only receive forgiveness by the Lord's blood. If we have offended man, we have to clear the offense with man, and this needs to be done first. At the same time, we have to say, "O God, I know that I have offended someone in a certain matter, and I have already cleared it up with him. Now, please forgive my trespass by the blood of the Lord Jesus." If we clear it up with others and confess to God today, He will surely forgive our trespasses according to the blood of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>Verse 7 says, "And the priest shall make propitiation for him before Jehovah, and he shall be forgiven for whatever he may have done by which he has become guilty." There is no trespass in the world that is too great for God to forgive. The question is whether or not we will confess. But we cannot lay aside the blood of the Lord Jesus. It is through the Lord's blood that we can have fellowship with God.</P><P>Today I would like all of us to see the place of confession in the Bible. Some may say we can be forgiven without confession; this is not enough. Others may say that through confession we are forgiven; this is too much. The Bible says that once we have offended someone, on the one hand, we need to deal clearly with man, and on the other hand, we need to confess clearly to God. God will forgive us by the blood of the Lord Jesus. If we do not clearly settle with man and only confess to God, our conscience will not be at peace, and we will not have the strength to believe that the Lord's blood can bring us forgiveness. Without the Lord's blood, our trespasses cannot be forgiven; however, if we do not confess to man, our trespasses will still not be forgiven just by trusting in the Lord's blood.</P><P>Today my only hope is that we would clearly settle before God all of our offenses against others. Otherwise we will lose our fellowship with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOTES ON SCRIPTURAL MESSAGES</H2><P>(1) This magazine was started in April of 1930.
