God is the Creator, and Christ is the image of the Creator. As such a One, He is surely divine. He is also the Firstborn of all creation. This indicates that He is also a creature. Since He became a man with blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14), surely He is a creature. Therefore, He is both divine and human. He is God and He is also a man. He is the Creator and He is also a creature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Christ as the Son of Man<br>Sitting on the Throne in Heaven</H2><P>Many do not know that after His resurrection and ascension Christ still has His humanity, and others would strongly disagree, saying that Christ is no longer a man. However, Matthew 26:63-64 reveals clearly that He is still a man. When He was being judged by the Sanhedrin, they charged Him: "Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God." In answering Jesus said, "You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven." Today Christ as the Son of Man is sitting on the throne in heaven, and He will come again also as the Son of Man.</P><P>Christ's being a man is altogether related to God's economy. His humanity, therefore, means a great deal. He has been exalted by God as a man, and as a glorified man He is now sitting in the heavens. At this point, I would ask you to consider a hymn on His exaltation as a man (Hymns, #132):</P><blockquote>Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting,<br>Christ the Lord is there enthroned;<br>As the man by God exalted,<br>With God's glory He is crowned.<br><br>He hath put on human nature,<br>Died according to God's plan,<br>Resurrected with a body,<br>And ascended as a man.<br><br>God in Him on earth was humbled,<br>God with man was domiciled;<br>Man in Him in heav'n exalted,<br>Man with God is reconciled.<br><br>He as God with man is mingled,<br>God in man is testified;<br>He as man with God is blended,<br>Man in God is glorified.<br><br>From the Glorified in heaven<br>The inclusive Spirit came;<br>All of Jesus' work and Person<br>Doth this Spirit here proclaim.<br><br>With the Glorified in heaven<br>Is the Church identified;<br>By the Spirit of this Jesus<br>Are His members edified.<br><br>Lo! a man is now in heaven<br>As the Lord of all enthroned;<br>This is Jesus Christ our Savior,<br>With God's glory ever crowned!<blockquote><P>I would call your attention to the lines which say that the church is identified with the "the Glorified in heaven." Christ has been glorified and exalted as a man, and we are identified with Him.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_117.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_119.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Samuel &nbsp; pg 118</div><br></body></html>
