<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>Today the Lord is recovering the organic building up of the Body of Christ. The contents of the outlines in this book are from audio messages and recent publications of Brother Witness Lee that have been made available to the Lord&rsquo;s children during the past four years; the basic revelation in these outlines is from his speaking during the past sixteen months. The outlines cover the matter of prophesying in the meetings of the church for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ. According to the scriptural revelation in Corinthians 14, prophesying is not in the sense of predicting, foretelling, but in the sense of speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord to dispense Christ to people. It is the excelling gift for the building up of the church. Our desire is that the Lord would use these outlines to help perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry, equipping them to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy to build up the Body of Christ.</p>

<h1 class="title">PROPHESYING<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:5b-6; 5:9-10; Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:8; 1:1-16; Col. 2:19; 1 Cor. 14:3-5, 12, 23a, 24, 26, 31a</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Lord is recovering four major items in the advance of His recovery today:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the priesthood of the gospel in the New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The beginning of the priesthood in the New Testament was with John the Baptist&mdash;Mark 1:1-4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins as the gospel of Jesus Christ.</li>
			<li>Not offering bulls and goats as sacrifices (Heb. 10:1-4) but offering sinners saved through his preaching as sacrifices (Mark 1:5).</li>
			<li>Bringing people to Christ&mdash;Mark 1:7-8.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The New Testament priests are priests of the gospel of God&mdash;Rom. 15:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Not a few individual priests but a universal priesthood, a priestly body&mdash;Rev. 1:6b; 5:9-10; 1 Pet. 2:5.</li>
			<li>Telling out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light, which is the preaching of the gospel of God&rsquo;s salvation in His virtues&mdash;1 Pet. 2:9.</li>
			<li>Making the saved sinners spiritual sacrifices to be offered to God for His acceptance&mdash; 1 Pet. 2:5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The apostle Paul is the unique pattern of the priests of the gospel in the New Testament (1 Tim. 1:16), doing the work of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel in three steps of offering:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Saving sinners to offer them to God as acceptable sacrifices&mdash;Rom. 15:16.</li>
			<li>Bringing the believers up to lead them to present themselves to God as living sacrifices&mdash;Rom 12:1.</li>
			<li>Warning and teaching every saint in all wisdom to present each one full-grown in Christ&mdash;Col. 1:28-29.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:12, 16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Body of Christ is an organism of the Triune God as the issue of the divine Trinity, not an organization of human beings&mdash;Eph. 1; John 15:1-5.</li>
		<li>The issue of the organic preaching of the gospel is that people are reborn, regenerated, to become the organic members of Christ&mdash;John 3:3, 5; 1 Cor. 4:15; Rom. 12:5.</li>
		<li>The organic building up of the Body of Christ is the increase of the Triune God in the believers for their growth in Christ&mdash;Col. 2:19.</li>
		<li>The organic building up of the Body is through the members of the Body feeding on the milk and food of the holy Word&mdash;1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 5:14.</li>
		<li>The organic building up of the Body is through the saints being perfected by the gifts&mdash;Eph. 4:11-12, 16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Not building up a congregation but an organic Body.</li>
			<li>Not only by the gifted persons but also by every member of the Body.</li>
			<li>Not in the organizational way but in the organic way.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:11-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord gave gifts&mdash;some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers&mdash;for the perfecting of the saints&mdash;vv. 11-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Unto the work of ministry.</li>
			<li>Unto the building up of the Body of Christ.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The perfecting gifts and the perfected saints, as the joints and the parts, as all the Body, cause the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love&mdash;v. 16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Through every joint of the rich supply supplying the Body.</li>
			<li>Through each one part operating in the Body according to its measure.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Ephesians 4:11 and 16 reveal the perfecting by the gifted persons as the joints of the rich supply.</li>
		<li>Ephesians 4:12 and 16 reveal the perfected saints as each one part of the Body of Christ doing the work of the New Testament ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ by operating according to its measure.</li>
		<li>Ephesians 4:12 and 16 reveal the joints supplying and the parts operating for the purpose of building up the organic Body of Christ:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply.</li>
			<li>Knit together through the operation in measure of each one part.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The building up of the church as the Body of Christ is in three levels:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Head builds up the Body by giving the gifted members as the joints to His Body&mdash; Eph. 4:11.</li>
			<li>The gifted persons perfect each one part of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:12.</li>
			<li>Each one part operates in its measure to build up the Body directly&mdash;Eph. 4:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord desires to recover the church meetings in mutuality with all speaking for building up&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:23a, 26, 31:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Each attendant having a portion of the riches of Christ to share with others mutually for the organic building up of the church&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26, 31.</li>
		<li>Prophesying in 1 Corinthians being to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, to dispense Christ into people:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He who prophesies builds up the church&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:4b.</li>
			<li>All believers having the capacity to prophesy and the obligation to prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:31, 24.</li>
			<li>Prophesying being the excelling gift among all the gifts, making its seekers excelling&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:12.</li>
			<li>All believers being charged by the apostle to pursue, to desire earnestly, and to seek to prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:1, 12, 39.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord desires to and will fulfill His words in Matthew 16:18, 1 Peter 2:5, Ephesians 4:11-16, and 1 Corinthians 14:26 concerning the building up of the church as a spiritual house for His dwelling, as a priestly body for His service, and as the organic Body of Christ for Christ&rsquo;s enlargement and expression.</li>

<h1 class="title">PROPHESYING<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:11-16; 1 Cor. 14:26, 3-5, 24-25, 31</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="3">
<li>Without the fulfillment of Matthew 16:18, Ephesians 4:11-16, and 1 Corinthians 14:26, the Lord cannot return:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The organic building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ must be accomplished (Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:12, l6).</li>
	<li>The church as the bride must be prepared for Christ as the Bridegroom (Rev. 19:7-9).</li>
	<li>In the Gospels, the only clear word concerning the building up of the church is in Matthew 16:18; in the Epistles, 1 Corinthians and Ephesians are the two particular books on the building up of the church as the Body of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Matthew 16:18 is fulfilled by practicing the revelation of Ephesians 4:11-16 and 1 Corinthians 14:26.</li>
		<li>On the one hand, 1 Corinthians 14:26 is fulfilled by practicing the revelation in Ephesians 4:11-16; on the other hand, unless the meetings of mutuality as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 are recovered in the practice of the church life, it is impossible to practice the building up of the Body of Christ as recorded in Ephesians 4:11-16.</li>
		<li>When all function in mutuality, as revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26, Ephesians 4:16 is fulfilled as the joints supply the Body richly and each one part operates according to its measure for the building up of the Body.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When we enter into the practice of the truth revealed in Ephesians 4:11-16 and 1 Corinthians 14:26, the Lord will have a way to work out His New Testament economy to recover the organic building up of the church and to prepare the bride for Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Ephesians 4:11-16 tells us that the church as the Body of Christ is not built up by the gifted persons directly; their work is to perfect the saints so that the saints can directly build up the Body of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Ephesians 4:11-16 reveals three levels of building:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ, the Head of His Body, builds up the Body (Matt. 16:18) by giving gifted persons as the joints to the Body (Eph. 4:11, 16).</li>
			<li>The gifted persons perfect the saints, each one part of the Body of Christ, to do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12).</li>
			<li>Each one part operates in its measure to build up the Body directly (4:16).</li>
			<li>By practicing Ephesians 4:11-16, every brother and sister will be perfected and they, in turn, will perfect others; in this way the Body of Christ will be built up through the members&rsquo; growth in life.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The main thing Ephesians 4:16 and 1 Corinthians 14:26 reveal is the proper church meeting for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ; this has to be fulfilled, and this fulfillment is a great part of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In order to have meetings as described by Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we must have the perfecting of the saints by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</li>
			<li>When all the saints have something of Christ to offer by prophesying in the church meeting (1 Cor. 14:24, 31) according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26, Ephesians 4:16 will be fulfilled.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>By this scriptural way, each one of us will be built up organically and the Lord will have something built up on this earth as His Body to be His bride so that He can come back.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>First Corinthians 14:26 reveals that the church meetings should be full of mutuality for building up; in the church meetings we should have mutual speaking, mutual listening, and mutual building up:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Whether we are building an organized congregation or building up the church as an organism has much to do with the way we meet.:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To meet according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 develops the spiritual, organic function of the saints.</li>
			<li>There is no need to keep the old way of meeting with one man speaking and the rest listening:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The old way is according to the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8 NASB); it is worldly and natural.</li>
				<li>2) The old way deadens and kills the organic function of the saints.</li>
				<li>3) The old way has become a deeply rooted habit that must be overthrown; to overcome, because of the pressure of the traditional thought, we have to push against it meeting after meeting.</li>
				<li>4) One person&rsquo;s speaking, although he may be capable and his content rich, can never be as rich in content as many saints speaking the riches of Christ in many aspects and from many directions.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s demand today is that the meetings in mutuality as unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14:26 be recovered; to prophesy is the top way and the unique way to have a church meeting full of mutuality (1 Cor 14:12, 31).</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We must endeavor to do everything we can to go along with the Lord for the fulfillment of 1 Corinthians 14:26:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>First Corinthians 14:26 is the Lord&rsquo;s word and His word must be fulfilled.</li>
			<li>We believe that today is the time to cooperate with him and labor with Him, so that we can be a channel for Him to fulfill His word in this verse.</li>
			<li>Because this way of meeting as described in 1 Corinthians 14:26 is ordained of God and is according to the Scriptures, we have to practice it at any cost; we all should press on faithfully to recover this verse.</li>
			<li>&ldquo;The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall by no means pass away&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 24:35.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>If 1 Corinthians 14:26 cannot be realized, how can the Body of Christ be built up?</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>First Corinthians reveals that the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ (1:2, 9, 24, 30; 5:7-8; 10:3-4, 16-17; 12:13; 15:45) will issue in three things:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The solving of the problems in the church through the work of the cross (1:13a, 18, 23-24; 2:2).</li>
	<li>The growth in life producing the precious materials for the building up of the church (3:6, 9-14).</li>
	<li>The developing of the believers&rsquo; gifts by the growth in life for functioning to build up the Body of Christ (1:7; 12:1-11, 31; 14:1), prophesying being the top development of saints&rsquo; gifts and the highest function for the building up of the church (14:3-5, 12):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To build anything you need firstly the materials and secondly the skill, the functioning.</li>
		<li>The enjoyment of Christ in 1 Corinthians eventually consummates in the building up of the church by prophesying.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul taught the crucial practice of prophesying to the church in Ephesus and to the church in Corinth before writing 1 Corinthians:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul wrote 1 Corinthians from Ephesus while he was teaching the saints in Ephesus (1 Cor.16:8).</li>
	<li>In Acts 20 we see that Paul taught the church in Ephesus everything that was profitable, even the whole counsel of God (vv. 20, 27); when Paul was teaching the saints publicly and from house to house (v. 20) in Ephesus he surely instructed them in the matter of prophesying.</li>
	<li>If Paul had not taught in Corinth the matter of prophesying prior to writing 1 Corinthians 14 the Corinthians would not have known the term <em>prophesying</em> (v. 1).</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph 3:11; 1:10; 1 Tim. 1:4; 1 Cor. 14:3-5, 12, 23a, 24-25, 31;Eph. 4:11-12, 16</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="7">
<li>God has a plan, an eternal purpose, which He made in eternity past for eternity future&mdash;Eph. 3:11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Testament speaks of the dispensation of God, the economy of God&mdash;Eph. 1:10; 1 Tim. 1:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Greek word for economy is <em>oikonomia,</em> which is composed of two words&mdash;<em>oikos</em> meaning house or household and <em>nomos</em> meaning law.</li>
		<li>An economy is the law of a household and denotes a household administration according to a certain arrangement.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s dispensation, God&rsquo;s economy, is His arrangement, His plan, to dispense the riches of Christ into His people.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s dispensation, His household administration, is a family matter; our God has the biggest family in the universe.</li>
	<li>God has a family plan to distribute all of His rich provision to His children:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All the riches of the Godhead and the fullness of the Godhead are embodied in Christ.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s family plan, God&rsquo;s family administration, is to distribute, to dispense, all the divine riches in Christ into His saved ones for their nourishment and feeding, resulting in the building up of the Body of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We are now under God&rsquo;s dispensing, and this dispensing is carried out by our prophesying:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To prophesy is to distribute, to dispense, the Triune God as the rich food, the nourishing element into others.</li>
		<li>Prophesying is the unique way, the best way, the excelling way, to dispense all the riches of Christ into God&rsquo;s people for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The excelling gift for the practical and organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ is prophesying&mdash;1 Cor. 14:3-5, 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the meetings of the church the highest function is to prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24-25, 31, 39:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Prophesying is speaking the Lord with the Lord&rsquo;s word under His inspiration.</li>
		<li>Prophesying is to speak to men building up for the church (this concerns the Body of Christ), encouragement for the believers (this concerns our goal, which is the building up of the Body of Christ), and consolation for the saints&rsquo; welfare (this concerns our personal welfare related to our goal)&mdash;1 Cor. 14:3.</li>
		<li>Prophesying is to convict people, to judge people, exposing the secrets of peoples&rsquo; hearts&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:24-25.</li>
		<li>Prophesying is that all the attendants may learn&mdash;l Cor. 14:31:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>For others to learn through our prophesying we have to learn something ourselves.</li>
			<li>Without learning we may speak many things, yet what we speak may only be common and ordinary talk.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Prophesying is the dispensing of the riches of Christ into God&rsquo;s people for the building up of the church, which is the organism of the processed Triune God, in the way of life&mdash;1 Cor. 14:4-5.</li>
		<li>A meeting in which all are prophesying is one that is full of nourishing, cherishing, adjusting, and correcting; furthermore, the saints are built up, supplied, furnished, and equipped.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The significance of prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and even to speak the Lord, to minister, to dispense the Lord, into others; in the sense of the divine dispensing, the entire Bible consummates in all prophesying&mdash;vv. 3, 24-25, 31.</li>
	<li>The characteristic of prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is to minister Christ for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ in the larger meetings of the church; prophesying is the particular gift for the building up of the church&mdash;vv. 3-5, 12, 24, 26.</li>
	<li>Prophesying is excelling in revealing God&rsquo;s heart, God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s way, and God&rsquo;s economy to His people.</li>
	<li>Prophesying is excelling in convicting people, exposing people&rsquo;s real condition, and showing people their spiritual need.</li>
	<li>Prophesying is excelling in speaking forth Christ to minister and dispense Christ to people for their nourishment.</li>
	<li>Prophesying is excelling in building up the church in the organic way by the dispensing, the distributing, of the riches of Christ into the saints that the church may be built up as the organism of the processed Triune God for His fullness, His expression.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;For you <em>can all</em> prophesy one by one, that all may learn...&rdquo;&mdash;l Cor. 14:31a.:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All prophesying one by one reveals the universality of prophesying&mdash;cf. Num. 11:29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Old Testament there were both male and female prophets&mdash;Exo. 15:20; Judg. 4:4; 2 Kings 22:14.</li>
		<li>According to the New Testament, sisters as well as brothers can prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 11:5; Acts 2:17-18; 21:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through their natural birth all receive certain abilities:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All can play the piano, possessing the innate ability by birth, but each one needs to be under the proper instruction of a tutor and he must practice according to that instruction.</li>
		<li>All can also write an essay, but each one needs perfecting through growth, proper instruction, and practice.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As long as we can speak a natural language, we can also prophesy, which is to speak the divine language:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Even if we desire to prophesy, we will not be able to without learning through proper instruction.</li>
		<li>We have to be faithful to learn to prophesy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We have to be instructed, and we have to practice according to what we have been instructed.</li>
	<li>Every saint can develop his speaking ability, that is, to prophesy, for building the church through the dispensing of the riches of Christ into others:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By the perfecting work of the prophets&mdash;Eph. 4:11-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Functioning as a joint with the rich supply, not as a mere Bible teacher speaking right and wrong.</li>
			<li>But as one ministering the life supply as the nourishment for the growth in life&mdash;the care for the organic Body in the organic way.</li>
			<li>With the living teaching to instruct, perfect, equip, and furnish all the saints that they may do the work of the New Testament ministry to speak the Lord into people for the building up of the Body of Christ in an organic way.</li>
			<li>The prophets should also visit all the members of the church to perfect them:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Sometimes they may instruct the saints in a small group, and sometimes they may &ldquo;tutor&rdquo; certain saints, that is, help one saint at a time in the practice of prophesying.</li>
				<li>2) They also speak with the saints concerning contacting the Lord in the word daily, being revived every morning, and living a victorious, overcoming life every day to lay a foundation for their prophesying.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>A prophet who is burdened to perfect the saints must also speak in the meeting to spontaneously set up a model.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>By the saints being willing and ready to be perfected unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord desires all the saints to be perfected, but the Lord is calling for overcomers (Rev. 2 and 3); His call for the overcomers indicates that not all the saints will be perfected.</li>
			<li>The ones who are willing and ready to be perfected will be the overcomers.</li>
			<li>We should all pray, &ldquo;Lord, make me willing and ready to be perfected. I will receive the perfection from the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. I am not content with my present situation.&rdquo;</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>By the perfected saints learning and exercise&mdash; Eph. 4:16; 1 Cor. 14:26, 31:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Operating as a part according to its measure in coordination with the joints of the rich supply.</li>
			<li>To cause the growth of the Body.</li>
			<li>Unto the building up of itself (the Body) in love.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>All the believers have the capacity to prophesy and have the obligation to prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:31a, 3-5, 24-25, 31b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The capacity being in the divine life, which the believers possess and enjoy and which needs to increase within them that the capacity may be developed unto their ability.</li>
		<li>The obligation being the fulfillment of their spiritual service, in which they are indebted to God&rsquo;s salvation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We can develop our prophesying capacity unto our ability through:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The experience of the Triune God.</li>
	<li>Being equipped in the Word.</li>
	<li>The growth in life.</li>
	<li>Praying unceasingly.</li>
	<li>Living and walking in the spirit.</li>
	<li>Preparing a living prophecy for the meetings.</li>
	<li>Practicing to speak the prophecy prepared.</li>
	<li>Speaking the particular word of prophecy in the meetings of the church.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Within two months by being perfected through revelation, learning, training, and exercise, we can all prophesy one by one when the church comes together.</li>

	<li>All the attendants in the church meetings can and should speak in prophecy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:31, 29-30, 6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The believers <em>can all</em> prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:31&mdash; &ldquo;You <em>can all</em> prophesy one by one....&rdquo;:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>That all may learn.</li>
			<li>That all may be encouraged.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The believers <em>should all</em> prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:3, 24-25&mdash;&ldquo;<em>If all</em> prophesy...&rdquo;:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>For building up.</li>
			<li>For encouragement.</li>

			<li>That the unbelieving and unlearned may worship God, reporting that God is really among the saints who are meeting together.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Having seen by revelation the God-ordained way of all prophesying in the meetings of the church, the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14 highly recommended it.:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Earnestly desire the greater gifts&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 12:31.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 1.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;He who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation [lit.]&rdquo;&mdash;v. 3.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;He who prophesies builds up the church&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;I desire that you all...may prophesy: ...greater is he who prophesies...that the church may receive building up&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits [lit.], seek that you may excel to the building up of the church&rdquo;&mdash; v. 12.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;If all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all; the secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you&rdquo;&mdash;vv. 24-25.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged&rdquo;&mdash;v. 31.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 39a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul also charged all the saints to prophesy in the meetings of the church:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul used certain verbs in this chapter to encourage the saints to prophesy:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Pursue&mdash;v. 1.</li>
		<li>Desire&mdash;vv. 1, 39.</li>
		<li>Seek&mdash;v. 12.</li>
		<li>Excel&mdash;v. 12.</li>
		<li>Learn&mdash;v. 31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul, as an example to the Corinthians, aspired to speak words of profit, i.e. to speak to the church...in prophecy&mdash;v. 6.</li>
	<li>Paul, likewise, encouraged the saints to excel by speaking words of profit for building up, i.e. to come together having a prophecy to speak&mdash; vv. 3-5, 12, 26, 31.</li>
	<li>Paul promoted all prophesying:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Now I desire that you all...may prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;You can <em>all</em> prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 31.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;If <em>all</em> prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 24.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;He is convicted by <em>all</em>&rdquo;&mdash;v. 24.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;He is judged by <em>all</em>&rdquo;&mdash;v. 24.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;<em>Each one</em> has&rdquo;&mdash;v. 26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul equated being a prophet with being spiritual&mdash;v. 37.</li>
	<li>Paul indicated in this chapter that the saints in Corinth had to be limited in their speaking in tongues and increased in their speaking for the Lord, i.e. prophesying:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Speaking in tongues, even if it is genuine and proper, only edifies the speaker himself.</li>
		<li>Prophesying builds up the church.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Principles for prophesying:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Your speaking should be short; do not speak too much:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The more you speak, the dimmer the light may become.</li>
		<li>The more you speak, the more the saints may get confused.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should use the time economically:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To speak a short, clear, profitable word.</li>
		<li>To leave time for others to prophesy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should practice speaking not longer than three minutes:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If you speak for less than one minute, you should have a main point.</li>
		<li>If you speak for more than one minute, you should have a line of development.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should be systematic:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Do not keep speaking and speaking without a main point or a specific and clear line of development.</li>
		<li>Do not go far away from your topic; learn to follow a particular line.</li>
		<li>Do not speak in a scattered manner with unrelated points.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should strike the crucial points clearly.</li>
	<li>You should not repeat the points you have already spoken:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Only strike the central points.</li>
		<li>Do not explain too much.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should be confident in what you are speaking.</li>
	<li>You should speak with authority:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Having the Word.</li>
		<li>Having the Spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should exercise to have the influencing power; exercise to have the impact that can move others:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is related to your spirit and your word.</li>
		<li>Every sentence you speak must have the proper expression and be uttered with an exercised and released spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>You should let the people see the light and get the life supply:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Release the truth.</li>
		<li>Dispense the life.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The short prophecies of not more than three minutes are most appropriate for district meetings, for meetings of the whole church, and for small group meetings.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>Learning and being perfected to organically prophesy (to speak the Lord into others) with the constituting elements of prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 14:4b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>By redeeming our time and spending our energy to be saturated and soaked with the holy Word to be equipped to prophesy&mdash;2 Tim. 3:16-17; Ezek. 3:4:

			<li>Finding God&rsquo;s words and eating them for them to become the joy and rejoicing of our heart&mdash;Jer. 15:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Studying the Word by using the best help to open it, expound it, and release its unsearchable riches&mdash;the Life-study Messages and Recovery Version footnotes&mdash;Luke 24:27, 31-32, 44-45; Acts 8:30-35.</li>

	<li>By being ready in the spirit to receive the instant inspiration of the Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">

	<li>By having a clear view with the insight to see through all things in all situations through the enlightening of the divine light:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Receiving revelation <em>only</em> in our spirit&mdash;Eph. 1:17: Rev. 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10.</li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Prophesying being a miraculous normality:

OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:31, 24-25, 14-16, 32, 23a, 26, 19, 1, 39, 12, 33; 1 Pet. 4:11; John 21:15; 2 Cor. 5:14-15; 4:16; 1 John 1:7, 9; Rev. 2:7; 1 Thes. 5:17; 1 John 1:2-3, 6; Gal. 5:16; Phil. 1:19-21; Eph. 5:18; Acts 4:31; 1 Tim. 2:4; Col. 3:16; Phil. 3:8-10; Col. 1:28-29; 1 Cor. 14:26</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="21">
<li>Prophesying is divine speaking, God&rsquo;s oracle:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>One who prophesies or one who is a prophet (1 Cor. 14:31, 29-30, 37) is one who receives revelations of the mysteries concerning Christ and the church (Eph. 3:5) and then speaks for God, speaks forth God, and even speaks God, dispenses God, into others, having God&rsquo;s oracle (1 Pet. 4:11).</li>
	<li>In both the Old Testament and the New Testament prophesying denotes the divine speaking, the divine oracle.</li>
	<li>Prophesying is not ordinary words spoken in a natural way but rather a speaking in the element of God&rsquo;s divinity:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To prophesy we must speak with the divine element.</li>
		<li>Without the divine element, our speaking is not prophesying; instead it is only empty talk without God&rsquo;s speaking, without reality, and without any divine revelation or ministry of Christ.</li>
		<li>The more of the divine element there is in our speaking, the more our speaking is prophesying.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To have God&rsquo;s oracle we must possess the element, essence, and substance of the Triune God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must be filled with the Spirit.</li>
		<li>We must be soaked with the Word.</li>
		<li>We must experience the divine life.</li>
		<li>We must pray ourselves into the Spirit all the time.</li>
		<li>We must walk in the Spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>All can have the oracle of God&mdash;1 Cor. 14:31; 1 Pet. 4:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Prophesying is speaking with God&rsquo;s oracle, God&rsquo;s divine speaking.</li>
		<li>Each one must be in the Spirit, having an exercised and released spirit (1 Cor. 14:14-16, 32) &mdash;where God&rsquo;s oracle is&mdash;to afford a way for God to speak.</li>
		<li>Each one must have a clear, sober, mind (1 Cor. 14:15, 19)&mdash;to understand and remember the things revealed to us by God&mdash;to render the human cooperation to the divine oracle.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When all prophesy, having God&rsquo;s oracle, a new one in the meeting is convicted by all and judged by all, the secrets of his heart become manifest, and he worships God, reporting that God is really among the saints&mdash;1 Cor. 14:24-25.</li>
	<li>We must speak in a divine way with the divine element by the divine life.</li>
	<li>In our prophesying, the divine speaking, we minister Christ into others; we dispense the very Christ we have received, experienced, and enjoyed to others.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To prophesy in the meetings of the church, we must care for our whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A presented body&mdash;to come together&mdash;1 Cor. 14:23a, 26.</li>
	<li>A sober, clear mind&mdash;to pray, sing, and speak&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:15, 19.</li>
	<li>An emotion&mdash;that desires earnestly to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:1, 39) and that is zealous to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:12).</li>
	<li>A will&mdash;that chooses to prophesy in a timely way&mdash; when to begin and when to cease&mdash;1 Cor. 14:32-33.</li>
	<li>An exercised spirit&mdash;to pray, sing, bless, and prophesy&mdash;1 Cor. 14:14-16, 31-32.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To prophesy in the meetings of the church, we must live a proper, normal Christian life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Loving the Lord&mdash;John 21:15, 17; Rev. 2:4; Eph. 6:24.</li>
	<li>Devoting ourselves to the Lord in His love&mdash;2 Cor. 5:14-15.</li>
	<li>Being revived every morning by enjoying the Lord in the Word to have a new start each day&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16; Lam. 3:22-23; Prov. 4:18; Jer. 15:16; Psa 119:147-148.</li>
	<li>Being enlightened and thoroughly dealing with our sins by confessing&mdash;1 John 1:7, 9.</li>
	<li>Living a victorious, overcoming life daily&mdash;Rev. 2:7; Rom. 10:12b.</li>
	<li>Praying unceasingly by calling on the Lord continually&mdash;1 Thes. 5:17; 2 Tim. 2:22.</li>
	<li>Abiding in fellowship with the Lord to partake of the divine life and to walk in the divine light&mdash; 1 Cor. 1:9; 1 John 1:2-3, 6-7.</li>
	<li>Walking by and according to our spirit mingled with the Spirit&mdash;Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4.</li>
	<li>Living Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21; Gal. 2:20.</li>
	<li>Being filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly&mdash;Acts 13:52; Eph. 5:18; Acts 4:31, 8; 13:9.</li>
	<li>Learning and gaining a full knowledge of the truth and letting the word of Christ dwell in us richly, thus keeping a rich storage of the Lord&rsquo;s word&mdash;1 Tim. 2:4; Col. 3:16; John 15:7; 1 John 2:14.</li>
	<li>Accumulating the experiences of Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:8-10, 12-14.</li>
	<li>Speaking Christ to all kinds of people at all times&mdash;Col. 1:28-29; 2 Tim. 4:2.</li>
	<li>Functioning in all kinds of meetings in mutuality:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By praying&mdash;1 Cor. 14:14-15; Acts 2:42; 12:5, 12, 17.</li>
		<li>By speaking and singing the hymns&mdash;Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:15, 26.</li>

<h1 class="title">PROPHESYING<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:23a, 26, 31-32</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="24">
<li>The practice of prophesying:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Preparation for our speaking in the church meetings is needed to prophesy properly and adequately:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>From our revelation gained from the Word of God and our experience of the Triune God during the week, compose a prophecy of no more than three minutes to speak when the church comes together:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>By enjoying the Lord through contacting Him in a portion of the Word every morning:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Choose a portion of the Word consisting of ten or fewer verses, covering one chapter of a book a week.</li>
				<li>2) Among these few verses there may be two or three verses which we especially enjoy, and we can concentrate on these.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>By writing down a short note of our spiritual inspiration, enlightenment, and enjoyment of the Lord each morning as a reminder of what we received from the Lord:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) These do not need to be long notes.</li>
				<li>2) Short notes with certain points as reminders are adequate.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>By putting all the notes, the &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; of our inspirations of the past six mornings, together for a total inspiration on the last day of the week and composing a prophecy of no more than three minutes to speak in the church meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Our speaking should not be too long or too short.</li>
				<li>2) If our speaking is too short our prophecy will not be so rich in content.</li>
				<li>3) Limiting our speaking to three minutes will help everyone to preserve the time for many saints to speak in the meeting.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>By having some &ldquo;tutors&rdquo; as coaches or instructors, tutoring us on how to compose a prophecy concerning its length, form, and content:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Those who know how to do this adequately can go out to visit the saints, the new ones and those willing and ready to be perfected in their prophesying, to look at their composition.</li>
				<li>2) Those tutoring the saints can improve the composition and adjust it to help them learn more.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Practice speaking the prophecy we have prepared in our home:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Checking to see whether it is three minutes or more.</li>
			<li>If it is too long, we can shorten it.</li>
			<li>If it is too short, we may feel to lengthen it.</li>
			<li>In this way we will have a proper prophecy prepared in writing.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>On the next day, the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we will go to the church meeting having something:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This will fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26, which says that when we come together, &ldquo;each one has.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>&ldquo;Each one has&rdquo; does not mean that each one functions in the meeting:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Even if we may not have time to function in the meeting, we will still be exercised and prepared to function.</li>
				<li>2) Whether we function in the meeting or not, we still have something.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Before coming to the meeting we should prepare ourselves for the meeting with things like these [in 1 Cor. 14:26] from the Lord and of the Lord, either through our experience of Him or through our enjoyment of His Word and fellowship with Him in prayer.</li>
			<li>Everyone has something to speak in the meeting, and when we come together in the meeting we also should come with a living and ready spirit.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>After coming into the meeting we need not wait, and should not wait, for inspiration; we should exercise our spirit and use our trained mind to function in presenting what we have been prepared with to the Lord for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their benefit&mdash;enlightening, nourishing, and building up:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This is just like the feast of tabernacles in ancient times: the children of Israel brought the produce of the good land, which they reaped from their labor on the land, to the feast and offered it to the Lord for His enjoyment and for mutual participation in fellowship with the Lord and with one another.</li>
			<li>We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting to offer.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Thus, the church meeting will be an exhibition of Christ in His riches and a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants with one another before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.</li>
		<li>When functioning in the meeting, we should care for the sequence of our speaking:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Those who realize they should not speak first will wait for the appropriate time to speak their prepared prophecy.</li>
			<li>When twenty saints speak in this way, it is like one person speaking a composed message; the contents are rich and they are arranged in a very good sequence.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the meeting, when the opportune time comes, we will speak, not read, our prophecy, and when we prophesy, we may add something to make our prophecy richer and more living:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We should always be ready in our spirit as we speak to receive the instant inspiration of the Spirit; if we are living a revived and overcoming life and are one with the Lord, we will always be ready to receive instant inspiration.</li>
			<li>We also need to have the spiritual insight into all matters through the enlightening of the divine light.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>According to our experience, it is better to have about fifty, or at the most seventy in the meeting when the whole church comes together or in a district meeting of the church:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>When the church meeting reaches eighty, we should divide into two meetings.</li>
			<li>If there are fifty, about one-third of the attendants can speak in one hour.</li>
			<li>Twenty speakers can occupy three minutes each, speaking for exactly one hour.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Preparation of our whole being is also needed for each church meeting in order to meet according to the standard of the New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must be revived every morning.</li>
		<li>We must live an overcoming life every day.</li>
		<li>(If we have all the light, all the revelation and all the truth, without revival and an overcoming living, everything is vain talk).</li>
		<li>We must abide in fellowship with the Lord daily.</li>
		<li>We must be a praying person, having a praying spirit and filled with a desire and an aspiration to pray.</li>
		<li>We must deal with our sins continually.</li>
		<li>We must be constantly filled with the Spirit.</li>
		<li>We must spend some time to pray for at least five to ten minutes immediately before attending the meeting to get our spirit prepared:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>If we have time we can pray for fifteen or twenty minutes, but we should not pray too long.</li>
			<li>A longer prayer can exhaust our spirit for the meeting.</li>
			<li>Confess your sins and enjoy the filling of the Spirit.</li>
			<li>After praying and before going to the meeting, we should exercise to avoid any discord with another person, and we should do our best not to receive phone calls or open any mail; many times these things are used by the enemy to deaden our spirit and distract us just before the meeting.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Start the meeting from your home, not when you come together with the saints:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name.</li>
			<li>Praying.</li>
			<li>Singing.</li>
			<li>Praising.</li>
			<li>Speaking.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Do not come to the meetings in a loose way:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Come to &ldquo;play in the game.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>To come in a loose way will deaden the meeting.</li>
			<li>Come to the front as fighting soldiers to conquer the enemy and as a prepared athlete to win the game.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Come to the meeting with the decision and anticipation that you will speak:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>At a feast the main thing is to eat.</li>
			<li>In a meeting the main thing is to speak.</li>
			<li>Go to the meeting to speak!</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The subject, goal, and purpose of the church meetings:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We do not need to have a definite subject in our meeting&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Our church meetings should be a feast of the riches of Christ.</li>
			<li>A feast is full of many different kinds of food.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The goal of our meeting is to exhibit Christ.</li>
		<li>The purpose of our meeting is to build up the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Further principles for prophesying in the church meetings (see XV):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By taking Christ as the center and element of our speaking.</li>
		<li>By endeavoring to speak everything with a verse or portion of the Scripture as its base.</li>
		<li>By looking to the Lord for instant and fresh enlightenment, vision, and utterance.</li>

<h1 class="title">PROPHESYING<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="25">
<li>A concluding charge concerning our prophesying according to God&rsquo;s standard for the building up of the church:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The six days of the week spent with the Lord in His Word each morning to richly enjoy Christ and to receive His enlightenment gives us the basic content for our prophesying:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Compile the top points at the end of the week from your daily enjoyment, enlightenment, and inspiration.</li>
		<li>Compose a short message as a prophecy, using the points you have compiled.</li>
		<li>Practice speaking that message.</li>
		<li>Prophesy in the meetings of the church using the words of your preparation and practice.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we prophesy we must have the instant inspiration of the Spirit; otherwise, our speaking will be mechanical:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Prophesying is not a speaking that is according to the letter but a speaking that is filled with the instant inspiration and the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</li>
		<li>Our prophesying is not to read what we have composed but at the opportune time to speak what we have composed in a living way.</li>
		<li>Our prophesying should not be merely something we have prepared and are speaking to the saints out of our memory; we must follow the feeling we had in fellowship with the Lord and the instant leading of the Spirit as we speak:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>What we speak may not be altogether according to what we have prepared beforehand; rather, as we are speaking a further seeing with new utterance comes, causing our speaking to be fresh and powerful:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Watchman Nee said that we cannot be a good speaker if we do not have the instant utterance.</li>
				<li>2) Andrew Murray said that a powerful and unlimited speaker always has some instant utterance, something new.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>If we only speak what we have prepared as an old foundation, this will not be adequate; every good speaker must look to the Lord for some fresh utterance and some fresh new light.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>When we speak, we must exercise not to use old terminology, but we must look to the Lord while we are speaking that He would give us the timely utterance with the instant view, the instant seeing, the instant inspiration; this will strengthen the spiritual nature of our prophesying.</li>
		<li>Our prophesying should not be mere doctrine gained from a Bible study, but something of a spiritual vision.</li>
		<li>Our prophesying must be organic, that is, living and fresh; otherwise, we may only build up an outward method with a correct practice.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Four additional vital points that must be cared for if we would be able to prophesy properly and adequately:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must love the Lord, have fellowship with the Lord, live in the presence of the Lord, be joined to the Lord, and be one with the Lord.</li>
		<li>We must labor to learn the truth by studying the Bible and books that expound the Bible, such as, the Life-studies, Recovery Version footnotes, <em>Life Lessons,</em> and <em>Truth Lessons,</em> that we might be saturated and constituted with the Word of God.</li>
		<li>We must have a living spirit and walk according to spirit.</li>
		<li>We must have a heavenly view, a broadened view, a clear view that knows Christ and knows the church, not having our own opinions and viewpoints but rather God&rsquo;s viewpoint concerning His interest on the earth, His Body, the church, the local churches, the individual saints, ourselves, the world situation, the sinners condition, and God&rsquo;s economy; this heavenly view is gained through God&rsquo;s light, His Word, and the experience of Christ as life and the Spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Go to practice prophesying, learn to prophesy, and then perfect others to do the same.</li>
