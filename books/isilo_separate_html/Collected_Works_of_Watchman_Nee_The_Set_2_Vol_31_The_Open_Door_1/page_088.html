Therefore, we hope you will do your best to send the news to us. Because the postal service is often blocked, we think it would be best if you could send your letters by express mail or air mail.</p><p>(2) Put a date on your letters. Without a date, we do not know when the news happened. Sometimes we cannot read the postmark.</p><p>(3) Write the address clearly and completely. If you are in a different province, write the province.</p><p>(4) When a mailing address changes, notify us immediately (if possible), so that we will still know where you are and not mail things to the wrong place.</p><p>(5) We edit this publication wherever we are, and we print and publish it in Hankow. Whoever wants this publication should subscribe to it by writing directly to Hankow. News of the work and the churches should also be sent directly to the Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><p>(6) Please pray much for this publication.</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>(1) This publication is temporarily being published in Hankow. Therefore, any news of the work and the churches, subscription order forms, and requests for information should all be sent directly to the Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</p><p>(2) There is a branch store of the Gospel Book Room in Hankow. Any locality near Hankow that wants to buy publications from our book room can buy them directly from Hankow. Those who live in Hankow should come to Gospel Court, Hsiao Tung 1 Alley. If Hankow does not have a certain book, Shanghai will send it by mail. However, we ask you to forgive us for the time it takes to mail.</p><p>(3) If anyone wants gospel tracts or wants us to print gospel tracts, please contact the Shanghai Gospel Book Room directly, P. O. Box 323, Shanghai. If anyone wants to request the brothers in Hankow to contact Shanghai, please write to them at Gospel Court, Hsiao Tung 1 Alley and ask the Hankow brothers to do it.</p><p>(4) Because the mail is often delayed (printed materials are even slower), one or two copies of this publication will be sent by the fastest method to all the localities. We will then send a large number to the responsible brothers of each locality and ask them to distribute the publication to each brother and sister. Then we will send them according to our subscription list. Therefore, if the brothers and sisters in each locality have not sent in a subscription form yet, please get your copy from the responsible brothers in your locality.</p><p>(5) All the letters for The Christian that are received in Hankow will be forwarded to the Shanghai Gospel Book Room to be recorded and answered. We hope that soon the mail will not be so much trouble and that the publication can be resumed.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_087.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_089.html">Next</a> </body></html>
