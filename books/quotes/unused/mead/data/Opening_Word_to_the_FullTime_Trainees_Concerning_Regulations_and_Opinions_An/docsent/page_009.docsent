   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When I was young, I read a story about a father and a boy with a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When they went through one village, neither of them rode on the donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people in that village criticized them by saying, "Why doesn't one of them ride on the donkey?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then the father told the son to ride on the donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When they passed through the second village, somebody criticized them by saying, "This little boy is no good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His father is so old, but he rides and his father walks."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When they heard this criticism, the father decided to ride on the donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then they passed through the third village, and some there criticized the father for riding on the donkey and making his son walk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, due to all this criticism, they got rid of the donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That meant they got rid of the item for people to criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All such criticisms are opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to admit that we are absolutely like this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I did not have the mercy based upon what the Lord has been teaching me through the years, my opinions might be much more than yours.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the guests who stay in others' homes have opinions about the way things are there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have learned the lesson by the Lord's mercy that when I am someone's guest, I would go only to the place which my host assigned to me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I would eat whatever is set before me without any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Could you learn not to express any opinion in any kind of situation?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you learn this lesson, you will be useful in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both opinions and oldness are big enemies to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For us to be useful in the Lord's hand we must deal with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have been reading the Bible for many years, and I have expounded the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But whenever I come to a portion of the Word, I do not consider that I know that much, because I want to see more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I could have another series of Life-studies on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, these Life-studies would be new and different.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our understanding of the Word should not be set or settled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must always keep ourselves so young, new, and fresh with a learning and open spirit when we come to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The technology in the world is always improving, but much of the time we remain the same in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we stay in our oldness, the Lord cannot move on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must learn these two things never to be old and not to have any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I assure you that if you would not be old, revelation will come to you every day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Oldness covers your view and causes you to be opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It covers your inner eyes to prevent you from seeing something new of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The trouble with today's Christianity is oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They say they keep the truth, but actually they are keeping their oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They would not have any kind of adjustment according to the revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter and Apollos both remained in their oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To remain in their oldness was for them to be natural.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your oldness will kill you, and your opinion will bury you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Look at the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Out of one hundred, it is difficult to find five who are not old and who are without opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this training you have to practice what I have told you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First, we saw that life grows by regulation toward maturity and function.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we saw that oldness is versus revelation and opinion is versus obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are an opinionated person, you cannot obey anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is not a message to stir you up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a message that would put you down in your oldness and in your opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These two things are the prominent troubles in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While the Lord was going on in His move with Peter, the Lord encountered trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord wanted to go on from the Jews to the Gentiles, to the ones who were unclean in the eyes of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He wanted Peter to contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For Peter to eat the unclean things was for him to contact the Gentiles, but Peter had his old concept.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The apostle Paul, however, was bold to go to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He did not just eat with them but he went to the Gentiles, city after city, to set up churches among them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He took the vision and dropped the oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was altogether new.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before he met the Lord on the road to Damascus, he was very stubborn, but his revelation caused him to drop his oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul was more stubborn than Peter, but Peter did not drop his oldness thoroughly and absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We know this because of what Paul told us in Galatians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Peter shrank back from eating with the Gentile believers out of fear of those of the circumcision vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This shows that Peter was not absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although Paul was younger than Peter, he rebuked Peter to his face for his hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is hard to see any signs in the New Testament that Paul was opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet we see two persons related to him who were very opinionated Barnabas and Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the one hand, he had trouble with Barnabas's opinion; on the other hand, he had trouble with Apollos's opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>So these two dear brothers were through with working together with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Aquila was different.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Timothy was also different.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When Paul asked Timothy to remain somewhere, he remained 1 Tim 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When Paul asked Timothy to come to him, he came 2 Tim 4:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Apollos was a good brother who knew the Bible, but when Paul urged him to go to Corinth, he would not go.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He did not want to go at Paul's desire, but at his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today in the ministry we have the same trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The full-time training is to train you to take the regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That means that you are being trained to drop the oldness and you are learning not to have any opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You have to get out of your oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Also, as long as the church and the ministry are going on toward the main goal, you have to forget your opinions.</S>
