In the New Testament, there are many teachings concerning the building up of the church, which is the Body of Christ
Verse 16 in particular is a crucial verse in the New Testament concerning the Lord's desire to build up His Body
Each part is organically related to the others in life, and each part participates in the one circulation of the same blood
If this is all that we see concerning the church, we may be led to believe that the church is a human organization like other social bodies
The Body of Christ, the organism of the resurrected and ascended Christ, is the organism of the One who fills all in all
We may consider the church to be merely the assembly of the called out ones, the congregation, or an organization of saved human beings
It is difficult to comprehend the Body of Christ, but God in creation made our human body as a figure of the Body
The building up of the Body of Christ is through the gifts produced by the Head of the Body in His resurrection
These gifted persons were produced not by a seminary or a Bible institute but by the Head of the Body in His resurrection
He has brought you to the heavens and presented you to His Father to please the Father, and the Father has returned you to Christ
By this process you, who were a sinner and a captive of Satan, became not only a member of Christ but also a gift
While we have it, we may not feel that it is useful, but if we lost it, we would feel that we lacked something
We should act, move, and do things in the church life organically in the resurrection of Christ, not in our natural life
If we do things in the church life by our natural life and strength, we are moving and acting in an organizational way
To clean the meeting hall in our natural life according to an outward arrangement is to act in an organizational way
They will say 'Hallelujah' organically, in the way that comes out of life, not out of arrangement or organization
Just as we love and care for every member of our physical body, the Lord loves and cares for every member of His Body, the church
Ephesians 5:29 says, 'For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church'
In our teaching to the churches and the saints there must be an organic element which can be taken in as nourishment
After listening to this teaching, we will be nourished, and this nourishment will result in the growth in life
Apostles are ones who preach the gospel to save sinners, bring them together to establish a church, and then appoint elders
We may think that after the apostles appoint the elders, they should leave and have nothing more to do with the church
How could the apostles perfect the saints if they had nothing more to do with the church and the elders that they had established?
After preaching elsewhere, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch and established elders in every church
Even the Epistles to Timothy and Titus were written in the principle of helping those who had been established by the apostles
In the same way, the apostles must stay with a church, first to train the elders and then, with the elders, to perfect the saints
Ephesians 4:11-12 implies that the perfecting by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers is particular
There may be a certain amount of the perfecting by the elders as the shepherds and teachers, but only in part and not in a particular way
In the same way, in the church life we need the perfecting by the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers
Because Ephesians 4:11-16 is the word of the Lord in the Bible, it will not only be touched but also fulfilled
In 1 Corinthians 14 the word prophesy is used not mainly in the sense of predicting but rather with the meaning of speaking forth
We do have certain gifted persons who speak to us, but speaking forth the Lord has not become a custom among us
When we consider the meetings in mutuality according to 1 Corinthians 14, we usually stress that everyone has to speak in the meetings
When we come together for a church meeting, there should be a number of the saints who can speak Christ and speak forth Christ
To speak Christ and speak forth Christ is to dispense Christ into the needy saints that they can be nourished and have the growth in life
All those dear saints had a heart to preach, but they were not trained, or perfected, in how to preach the gospel
A local church may be likened to a teachers' college, and the gifted persons are like professors teaching different courses
In order to help us understand the perfecting of the saints, we need to look at the type of the priesthood in the Old Testament
As the New Testament priests, we should learn how to display Christ as the showbread to all of God's worshippers
We have to help the saved ones by showing them how to enter into the Holy Place to enjoy Christ as their life supply
We have to help the saints to realize and enjoy Christ as their divine light, shining within them with the sevenfold Spirit
As the New Testament priests, we must learn to fellowship with God in prayer, and we must be able to perfect the saints to do the same thing
The priesthood perfects the saints to present Christ as the offerings, the sacrifices, at the brass altar, the cross
It also perfects the saints to present Christ to God at the golden incense altar as the allinclusive incense that they may converse with God
The saints need to be perfected to fellowship with God in a conversational way to enjoy His presence, to enjoy the Triune God Himself
We need to be perfected to take care of these four major items of the priesthood, and we must perfect others to do the same thing
The New Testament uses the word 'priesthood' to refer to the priestly office and to the priestly body, the corporate body of priests
In the Lord's recovery, we are short of the services of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Paul included himself and all the serving apostles and gifted ones in saying that we all have to go on to arrive
The Lord desires all the saints to be perfected , but the Bible shows us that the Lord is calling for overcomers
In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord is sounding the trumpet for overcomers
According to Revelation 17:14 the army of overcomers that follow the Lamb are 'called and chosen and faithful'
The choosing of the Father in eternity past was for salvation, but the choosing in Revelation 17 at the end of this age is for overcoming
Thank God that we have been chosen by Him in eternity for salvation, but now we are under the test to be approved
These ready to fight chosen overcomers will be the bride in Revelation 19 to attend the wedding feast of the Lamb
Everyone who is contented with the present situation of the church life is not ready to be perfected, to go on with the Lord
During this period of time, we may have heard many messages, yet our situation is not up to a level with which we can be satisfied
What a privilege, what a mercy, and what an all-sufficient grace that we are now in the one organism of the Triune God!
We have to be perfected so that the entire Body of Christ functions in the same way that the gifted members do
In a local church, some can do the apostles' work to preach the gospel, teach the truth, establish churches, and appoint elders
God's intention is to perfect every saint to do what the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers do
Some will be perfected to do the prophets' work to speak God, speak for God, and speak forth God, ministering Christ to all the people
The saints in a local church must be perfected to do the same work that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers do
The saints are perfected by the perfecting gifts with the life supply as the nourishment for the growth in life
The perfecting of the saints is in view of the work of the ministry, which is the unique ministry in the New Testament
Paul's stress was not on the building up of the church as a congregation but on the building up of the Body as an organism
The saints are perfected unto the work of the ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ as an organism
The British Brethren who were raised up in the early part of the nineteenth century were greatly used by the Lord
Brother Nee told them that they would be welcome, but he asked them to please not bring with them anything of what they represented
Lang in his book The Churches of God condemned what Darby did, saying that Darby was trying to make the churches a federation
There is only one circulation of blood in our physical body, and the members are all organically related to one another
All the members of the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God, enjoy the same life and are organically related to one another
Should he have the attitude that because he is a member of the church in New York, he is not a member of the church in Taipei?
If we go to Japan and meet with the saints there, we are one with them because we are members of the unique, universal Body of Christ
All the members of the Body of Christ who do the work of the ministry participate in the unique ministry of God's New Testament economy
The unique ministry of the Old Testament was the ministry of death because that was the ministry of the law which condemns and kills us
The work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ is directly by the perfected saints in the growth in life
We are under the process of building and we are on the way of building until we arrive at the practical oneness
The Old Testament ministry was a ministry of the law, whereas the New Testament ministry is the ministry of the faith
As the law is the center and reality of the Old Testament, so the faith is the center and reality of the New Testament
The New Testament begins with the incarnation of Christ and continues with His death, resurrection, and second coming
His death and resurrection with His second coming issue in the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate consummation of the church
When we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of this all-inclusive person, we will not care for minor things
In Romans 14 Paul was very general in his attitude toward doctrinal matters that did not concern the faith or Christ's all-inclusive person
Some Christians receive other believers on the basis of what they believe concerning the Lord's second coming and the rapture
We have to learn the aspects of Christ's person in His death on the cross and the things that He terminated and took away on the cross
We have to know Christ as the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, the complete God and the perfect, tripartite man
His chosen and redeemed ones are regenerated, they are being transformed, and eventually they will be glorified
We are growing up in full measure through the direct building of all the saints perfected in the growth of life by the gifts
These rescued captives, through the process of Christ's full redemption, have been constituted into persons who are gifts
The Father returned these gifts to Christ, who then gave them to His Body to perfect the saints for its building up
In the real practice of the building of the church, Christ as the Head of the Body does not do the direct building work
To perfect the saints is to build them up, to equip them, and to furnish them with whatever they need for their work
If there are some saints meeting together as a local church, there must be some among them who are the Christ-given gifts
Not only should they function in these areas, but they should also spend their time and energy to perfect the saints
There have also been many councils throughout church history that have resulted in many creeds, or statements of belief
In Galatians Paul tells us that the law was everything in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament the faith has come to replace the law
We Christians who are seeking after the Lord should live a life in which we have a new revival, a new sunrise, every day
Paul told the Corinthians that he did not give them the solid food for nourishment because they were still babes, infants, in Christ
Some think that because they are not a pastor, preacher, or elder, they have no position or right to baptize people
The baptisms of the early believers were without regulations and rituals, but they did what was convenient according to where they were
Galatians 6:1 says that if a brother is overtaken in some offense, we who are spiritual should recover him in a meek spirit
The first chapter of Philippians talks about the bountiful supply of the Spirit for magnifying and living Christ
We may feel that these teachings happen only occasionally, but in actuality they take place according to a satanic system
Satan has systematized the crafty, dividing teachings, causing errors that damage the practical oneness of the Body life
The result of Paul's opinion in 1 Corinthians 7 was the edification of the saints and the building up of the church
We will preserve ourselves from being destroyed if we check whether someone's teaching or talk kills us, deadens us, or makes us alive
Ephesians 4:15 says that we have to grow up into Him in all things, that is, in every aspect of our daily life
Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul-mind, emotion, and will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit
We have to let Christ spread from our spirit to our mind, emotion, and will so that He can take over, possess, and occupy our heart
If this person only occupies the living room and every other room in the house is locked, he is not yet settled down in his house
Christ needs to make His home in our hearts in all the practical aspects of our daily life so that we can grow up into Him in all things
If Christ were in our mind, emotion, and will, we might not even go shopping for the things that we were considering to buy
We need to allow Christ to take over our feeling in our emotion, our thinking in our mind, and our deciding in our will
At this juncture the very Christ who is living in our spirit desires earnestly to get into our mind, to control our thinking
Sometimes the Lord will say that this brother only did something wrong in our eyes; then He will show us that we were more wrong than he was
If we do not cooperate with the Lord in this matter to allow Him to make His home in our hearts, we are not growing into Christ
Only Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, and the church, the organism of the Triune God, are the true things on this earth
To grow up into Him in all things means that we grow up into Him in every way and in every aspect of our daily walk
When we are not letting Christ increase in us, we are not taking Him as our Head by subjecting ourselves to Him
When the apostle Paul wrote Ephesians 4:16, he did not have the local or universal aspects of the church in mind
In Ephesians 4:16 'all the Body' includes Peter, James, John, Paul, Barnabas, Ignatius, Martin Luther, and all of us
All of God's chosen and redeemed ones in the past, in the present, and in the future are referred to by Paul when he says 'all the Body'
After the Lord unveiled the Father's house, the vine tree with the branches, and the newborn child, He prayed for all of us to be one
For the house of the Father, for the vine tree with all its branches, and for the newborn child, there is the need of oneness
We may declare or even sing that we are all in one accord, but is there the one accord among us today in the recovery?
As long as the saints are not being perfected by the gifted persons, we are not on the way to arrive at the oneness
If we are the gifts-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers-we must learn how to perfect the saints by feeding them
We need to forget about the past and go on together with the Lord and in the Lord according to the tree of life
Because we are so closely related to one another in the church life, there is always friction among the saints
Sooner or later all Gods chosen ones Gods redeemed ones will arrive at the point where they all have grown up into the Head in all things
Let us forget about good or evil, right or wrong, and yes or no, and only care for Christ as our life and our life supply
With the Head as the source, all the Body issues the life supply to all the members for the building up of the Body
When a member of our physical body gets hurt, the rest of our body supports that wounded part with the life supply
If a member of the Body is weakened or hurt, we should not talk about this member, criticize him, or condemn him
The life supply that we dispense to others depends upon how much of the life supply that we ourselves have received from the Head
The joints of the Body of Christ are joined closely together, and all the parts of the Body are interwoven together
For the joints to be joined closely together is for them to be articulated and fitted closely together in harmony
Every piece of stone in a stone building has been interwoven together, knit together, by being compacted together in a solid way
In the Body of Christ, we are being knit together, being compacted together solidly, through the growth in life
The more that we rebuke others, condemn others, reason with others, or argue with others, the more wounds there are
The Body is fitted and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part
By this rich supply of Christ, all the members of the Body will get the nourishment with which they will grow in life
We need to meet according to what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 so that each one part may be perfected and developed in his function
If our physical body takes in the proper nourishment and functions in a healthy way, it will cause our body to grow in life
He will perfect His church to serve, to act, to enjoy Him, and to meet together absolutely according to the Scripture
We need to meet according to what is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 for the building up of the Body of Christ
In John 15 the Lord reveals that the branches need to love one another to express the divine life in fruit-bearing
We must be one in the Triune God and we must love one another with the divine love for the building up of the Body of Christ
