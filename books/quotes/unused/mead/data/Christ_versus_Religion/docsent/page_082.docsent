   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RIGHT BUT DEAD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the history of the Lord's recovery, the Lord moved on from Thyatira to Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sardis was a partial recovery from Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But according to the Word of the Lord it was only a short time after Sardis appeared that she became a kind of dead religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What was wrong with Sardis?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was not much wrong; the only problem was that she was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord said to her, "Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead," and, "Strengthen the things...that are ready to die."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In nearly everything, Sardis was in a state of deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From church history we see how the church through Martin Luther experienced a certain amount of recovery, but everything soon became dead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To have anything right in a dead way is a kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are sound, fundamental, and scriptural, but dead, we have simply fallen into a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you speak about justification by faith, it is good and right, but if you speak in a dead way, that also is a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have met a good number of so-called Lutheran believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lutheran Church, we know, stands strongly for Luther's teaching concerning justification by faith, and these followers spoke much with me regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were one hundred percent right, but only in doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They could speak much about justification by faith, but I eventually discovered that they were not justified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were absolutely correct doctrinally speaking, but they had no experience of what they spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is just a kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Religious people hold certain religious teachings without any life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Take this principle and check with various groups in Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You will find that with nearly all of them the principle is the same they hold the teachings, but there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, I fear that if we are not on the alert, we may hold the right teachings concerning Christ as the life-giving Spirit and yet not have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may even have the correct teachings concerning such a matter as this, but without the life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This also is a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything we teach, everything we minister, everything we stand for, must be full of life; otherwise, we are perpetuating the history of Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the religion of Sardis?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is to hold something so right, so fundamental, and so scriptural, yet without life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even the matter of the church life and the church ground can be held merely as a right doctrine, stripped of life and impact.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Anything that is scriptural and even spiritual, yet without life, becomes religion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord cannot tolerate those who are "deadly right."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the fourth step.</S>
