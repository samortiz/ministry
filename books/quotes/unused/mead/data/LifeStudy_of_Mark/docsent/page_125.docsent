   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BROUGHT INTO THE DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No doubt, this woman had been brought into the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Burial, of course, is between death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She poured out her best upon the Lord as her all-inclusive replacement, and she did this for His burial.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that she took His death in order to have the full enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we had only the Gospel of Mark, we would not be able to have an adequate understanding of what it means to be brought into the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Acts and in Paul s Epistles we see the development of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are in Christ s death and resurrection, we can enjoy Him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can be like the woman in Mark 14, who entered into the Lord s death and resurrection and thereby enjoyed Him as her full replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Within her there was no ground for anything or anyone other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Within her there was no room for Moses or Elijah or the temple, and there was no ground for herself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She had been replaced by this lovable One.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This woman had been fully prepared to take the Lord as her replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She had passed through all the steps of the process with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whereas we may say that Peter was somewhat coarse, she was thorough and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason, she was certainly brought into the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She realized that the Lord would be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But this thought concerning the Lord s death did not get into Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because she took in the Lord s word regarding His death, she also seized the opportunity to anoint Him for burial.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this one step she took the Lord s death and was working for His burial.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was the good work she did upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then a few days later she was among those who entered into the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, she was a forerunner, one of the first to enjoy the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By means of the Lord s preparation, she entered into His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>CHRIST AS OUR REPLACEMENT IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen that in chapter thirteen the Lord was preparing His disciples for His death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He continued this preparation in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord s preparation began with His unveiling to the disciples how God s economy will produce a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The birth of this new man requires the suffering of birth pangs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Mark 14 the Lord continued to prepare the disciples by enjoying their love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Entering into a home composed of cleansed lepers, He enjoyed the feast and also the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The feast was a matter of inner satisfaction, and the anointing was a matter of pouring out upon the Lord something with a sweet savor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, in Simon s house in Bethany the Lord was both satisfied and anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was anointed not by God, but by one of those who loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Simon s home in Bethany, the Lord was the replacement for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who loved Him did not have anything or anyone apart from Him within them or around them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They had only this wonderful Person, who was everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have pointed out that in 14:1-11 we have a miniature of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In particular, we have a miniature of the experience of taking Christ as the all-inclusive replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, in the church life as depicted by this miniature, we have Christ as our replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We in the church life are lepers who have been cleansed by Him, and in our hearts there is room only for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Within us, around us, and with us there is nothing but the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We take Him as everything through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the beginning of this message we pointed out that in 14:1-11 we have the merging of the conspiracy of the opposers, the love of the Lord s followers, and the plot of Judas to betray Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning Judas plot, 14:10 and 11 say, And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests that he might deliver Him up to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And hearing this, they rejoiced and promised to give him money.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And he sought how he might opportunely deliver Him up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The money promised to Judas was thirty pieces of silver Matt 26:15 , the value of a slave Exo 21:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While one of the Slave-Savior s followers expressed her love to Him to the uttermost, another was about to betray Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One treasured Him, and at the same time another was preparing to deliver Him up.</S>
