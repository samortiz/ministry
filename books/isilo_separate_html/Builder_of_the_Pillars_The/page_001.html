OF THE PILLARS</h1>
<p>The most striking feature of the exterior of the temple built by Solomon was the two pillars (1 Kings 7:15-22). Much of what is found in the Old Testament, such as the tabernacle and the temple, is a shadow, a type. We need to know the fulfillment of all these types. Whereas the pillars in 1 Kings 7 refer to the building of the temple of God in the Old Testament, the pillars in Galatians 2:9 refer to the building of God&rsquo;s house in the New Testament, and the pillar in Revelation 3:12 refers to the New Jerusalem in the coming kingdom and in eternity. The building of God&rsquo;s house is altogether dependent on the pillars. Young people, my burden is that you realize that your responsibility is tremendous. Today we all have the golden opportunity to be perfected and to be made pillars. I believe that after a few years many of you will become pillars.</p>
<p>The pillars of the temple in the Old Testament were built by Solomon through Hiram, &ldquo;a bronze worker&rdquo; who was &ldquo;full of wisdom and understanding and skill to do all kinds of work in bronze&rdquo; (1 Kings 7:14). Solomon was a type of Christ, and Hiram was a type of the gifted person in the New Testament. That the pillars were not built by Solomon directly but by Solomon through Hiram indicates that today Christ does not build up the pillars directly but through the gifted persons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">* * *</p>
<p>Here we shall consider Hiram, the builder of the pillars (1 Kings 7:13-15; 2 Chron. 2:13-14). In 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles the Bible has much to say about Hiram. Although David and Solomon both prepared skillful men for the building of the temple, Hiram is the only one of these skillful builders mentioned by name. The Bible not only mentions Hiram&rsquo;s name, but also gives his background in a detailed and meaningful way, telling us of his mother and father and of Hiram himself. As we study the Bible, we must realize that it has no wasted words. Everything it stresses or repeats is meaningful. Instead of considering some verse as mere repetition, we must find the significance in each repetition.</p>
<p>When I spent much time studying the two pillars in 1 Kings 7 nearly fifty years ago, I did not see any light. I only saw that the names of the two pillars were Jachin, meaning, &ldquo;He shall establish,&rdquo; and Boaz, meaning, &ldquo;In it is strength.&rdquo; But as we have been considering Jacob&rsquo;s dream and his experience at Bethel, I began to study these two pillars again. This time a great deal of light, like the fourth-day light (Gen. 1:14-19), shined upon me. In my study of the pillars I found that many verses mention Hiram, the builder of the pillars. I knew by the speaking of the Spirit within that I had to pay attention to this. While I was considering the pillars, light also came concerning Hiram&rsquo;s mother and father, neither of whom is named in the Scriptures. I was especially bothered by the fact that, according to the Hebrew text, 1 Kings 7:14 says that Hiram was of the tribe of Naphtali. As I considered all these things further, I realized that I needed one complete message to discharge my burden on the builder of the pillars.</p>
<p>When you hear about the builder of the pillars, you may say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I could ever be a builder. As long as God&rsquo;s mercy and grace would make me a pillar, I would be more than satisfied.&rdquo; But do not be so limited. God&rsquo;s grace is unlimited. It can not only make you a pillar, but even a builder of pillars. Although I am not saying that all of us will be pillars or builders of pillars, I believe that in the coming years many, even some sisters, will become pillars. If you do not believe this word now, I would ask you to wait for several years. Then you will see many pillars raised up in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. When that time comes, I will be happy. Furthermore, I believe that a good number of us will also become Hirams, the builders of pillars. God needs these Hirams. Only one temple was built in Solomon&rsquo;s time, but today many local churches need to be built. How many Hirams will be required for this work! Every local church needs at least one Hiram. Whenever there is a Hiram in a local church, that church is in glory. Thank the Lord that He has raised up a number of Hirams in the past. But I believe that in the future the Lord will perfect many more Hirams.</p><br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
