   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CALLED ONE A. Having Been Dealt With</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Prepared for Forty Years</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God spent another forty years to bring this capable yet disappointed man to the end. It is not an easy matter to terminate such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It took forty years of discipline to make Moses realize that he was not qualified to deliver God s people out of Egypt and to bring them into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During his first few years in the wilderness, Moses might have complained about his fellow Hebrew who refused to recognize him as the deliverer of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moses might have said, How blind he was!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He didn t realize that I was the one to deliver them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of him, I was forced to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one among the children of Israel can do what I could have done.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But now everything is ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that as year after year went by, Moses attitude began to change; eventually he no longer blamed others for his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is easy to educate a person, but it is very difficult to terminate him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But after those years in the wilderness, Moses was fully terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When God appeared to him in the burning thorn-bush, Moses considered himself good for nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, at that very juncture, when Moses thought that he was finished, God came in to call him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God dealt with Moses and prepared him over a span of forty years Acts 7:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know that Moses was dealt with just by the fact that he had to live in the wilderness after having been raised in the royal palace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose someone raised in the United States is suddenly forced to live in a very backward country.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Day by day that person will have the feeling that he is being dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses, no doubt, had this feeling in the wilderness as he worked as a shepherd to care for a flock that did not even belong to him, but belonged to his father-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through such a dealing, Moses was gradually prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. Having Lost Confidence in Himself</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After those years in the wilderness, Moses lost all confidence in himself 3:11; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God called him, Moses said, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why then does Stephen in Acts 7:22 say that Moses was powerful in his words and deeds ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Moses was forty, he was mighty in words and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that he was eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after another forty years he lost confidence in himself; he regarded himself as one who was slow of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The record in Exodus 4 and the one in Acts 7 are both true.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The record in Acts 7 applies to Moses at the age of forty, whereas the record in Exodus 4 applies to him at the age of eighty, after he had been dealt with and after his natural ability had been stripped away.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Few Christians really know God s way of dealing with people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have met a good number of saints who were extremely confident that they had received a burden from God to do a certain work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, without exception, as soon as they began to do something, God intervened to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever we are so assured that we are called and burdened, we should expect God s dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may expect others to stand with us, but they oppose us instead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Disappointed by this rejection, we may decide to drop the burden altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we cannot drop any burden that truly comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you can drop a burden this indicates that it was not of God in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever we have been burdened by the Lord, we cannot lay aside that burden, no matter how much others may oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although we may be extremely disappointed, the burden remains with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sooner or later, it rises up within us again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No doubt, when Moses was forty years of age a burden came to him from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am convinced that Moses parents, especially his mother, had consecrated him to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No doubt Moses willingly accepted God s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, because he was so confident that he had the ability and the power to carry out this burden, God arranged for him to be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moses must have been deeply disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Year after year, God worked on Moses, not to eliminate the burden, but to terminate Moses natural ability and to cause him to have no confidence in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our problem is this: If we have a burden from the Lord, we tend to use our natural strength to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But if our natural strength is dealt with, then we tend to cast aside the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not separate God s burden from our natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We like to marry these two things, but God wants to divorce them, to keep the burden and to set aside our natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, God took forty years to deal with Moses natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In principle, He will do the same thing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When God called Moses, Moses said that he was slow of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It seems that Moses was saying, Lord, now that You have dealt with my ability, I no longer accept Your burden.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I want to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I am not the right person to be sent to Pharaoh to deliver the children of Israel out of his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am slow of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How can I speak to Pharaoh?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In speaking this way to the Lord, apparently Moses was sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God, however, was angry with him 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This indicates that on Moses side there was some problem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God wanted to hire Moses, but Moses refused to accept the job.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As Moses was bargaining with the Lord, God knew what was in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Inwardly Moses might have been saying, Lord, forty years ago I tried my best to rescue the children of Israel, but You didn t allow me to succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I was rejected, and I had to flee to this wilderness, where I have been suffering for forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have forgotten everything I learned in the royal palace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have become nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now You say that You want me to go to Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When I was qualified, You fired me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But now that I am disqualified and incapable, You want to hire me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Secretly, Moses might have been blaming the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This might have been the reason God was not happy with him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Both in Moses and in God there was something that was not expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Within Himself the Lord might have been saying, Moses, I don t need you to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Don t you see the thorn-bush there?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is burning, but it is not consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I want you simply to manifest Me. Moses, don t reject the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Receive it, but don t use your ability and strength to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Because you consider yourself ready for death, I can now use you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Moses, don t reject Me. I do not intend to use you according to your natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I want to use you in My way, as a thorn-bush that is burning without being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not easy to do something for God without using our own strength or ability.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Throughout the years I have been learning this very lesson, mainly through sufferings and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Often people have the attitude that if they are asked to do something, they should be able to do it their own way without interference or advice from others.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Even elders in the church may have this attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our feeling may be, If you want me to do this, then please stay away and let me do it.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, when God calls us to do something, He wants us to do it, but not by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When He calls us, it seems that God says, Yes, I want you to do this, but I want you to do it by Me, not by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Our problem often is that if we cannot do a certain thing by ourselves, then we refuse to do it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This attitude has been a great hindrance to the work of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Many saints know that we need the church life, but, because they are disappointed, they are reluctant to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They are like the disappointed Moses in the wilderness who was dealt with by God until he lost his confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, he was still willing to take up the Lord s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Moses was burdened by God before he was forty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Nevertheless, Moses had to learn to cooperate with God without using his natural ability and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>God s call could not come until Moses had lost all his confidence in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In principle God deals with us in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When we no longer trust ourselves, He comes in to call us.</S>
