   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING CHRIST ABIDING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To live in the Divine Trinity is to abide in Christ, and to live with the Divine Trinity is to have Christ abide in us John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we abide in Christ, Christ abides in us, and His abiding is His presence with us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When He abides in us, we have His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have Him with us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Having the Words of Christ Abiding in Us</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>for the Bearing of Remaining Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To have Christ abiding in us is to have the words of Christ abiding in us for the bearing of remaining fruit John 15:7-8, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 15:7 the Lord said, "If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This kind of asking is related to fruit-bearing v. 8 and surely will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are to be those who go forth to preach the gospel, we must be those who love the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be those who have the living word, the word of life, abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are not such persons, our preaching of the gospel will not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The living word of Christ stirs us up to go forth and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word of Christ abiding in us brings us the enjoyment of all that the Triune God is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This encourages us, stirs us up, burdens us, and charges us to go forth to preach the gospel to people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not have the word of Christ abiding in us, we may go out to reach people, but what we do will be in a poor way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The content and the issue of what we do will be vain, empty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are going to do a rich work, a work full of the riches of the Triune God, we must have the word of Christ abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then when we talk to people, we will not talk to them with our own opinion, our own thought, our own word, our own expression, or our own utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We will talk to people with the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why Paul charges us in Colossians 3:16 to let the word of Christ abide in us richly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to have a storage of the word of Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then what we speak will be the word of Christ, which expresses the very riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To have the word of Christ abide in us is a rich enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Having the Spirit of Reality Abiding in Us</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To have Christ abiding in us is to have the Spirit of reality abiding in us John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 14 16 is a long message given by the Lord just before He was betrayed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter fifteen the Lord mentions His words abiding in us, and in chapter fourteen He speaks of the Spirit of reality abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, the words of Christ and the Spirit of reality are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 6:63 the Lord told us that the words which He has spoken are spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's word and God the Spirit are both God's breath.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When this breath gets into us and remains in us, this breath is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When this breath comes out of us through our speaking, it becomes the word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we breathe in the word of the Bible, the word becomes the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We contact our Triune God through the Spirit and in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We enjoy Him through the Spirit in our spirit and in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as we have His words abiding in us, this issues in the Spirit abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more His words abide in us, the more the Spirit abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These are two aspects of the breath of our Triune God.</S>
