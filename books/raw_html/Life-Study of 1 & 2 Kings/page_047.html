<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE REIGN OF AHAB OVER ISRAEL</H2><P>In 16:28b&#151;22:40a we see the reign of Ahab over Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Reigning over Israel for Twenty-two Years</H2><P>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab began to reign over Israel, and he reigned in Samaria for twenty-two years (16:28b-29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Doing What Was Evil in the Sight of Jehovah<br>More than All Who Were before Him</H2><P>Ahab did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah more than all who were before him (vv. 30-33). He considered it a light thing to walk in the sins of Jeroboam (v. 31a). He took Jezebel, the daughter of the king of the Sidonians, as his wife. Then he went and served Baal and worshipped him, raising up an altar to Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria (vv. 31b-32). Furthermore, he made the Asherah and did more to provoke Jehovah to anger than all the kings of Israel preceding him (v. 33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In His Days the Rebuilding of Jericho<br>Bringing In the Curse to Them<br>as Joshua Had Prophesied</H2><P>In the days of Ahab, Jericho was rebuilt, and this brought in the curse to them as Joshua had prophesied (v. 34; Josh. 6:26).</P>
