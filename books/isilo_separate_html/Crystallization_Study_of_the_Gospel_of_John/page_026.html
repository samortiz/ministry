The All-terminating, All-redeeming,<br>Life-releasing, and New-man-creating Death</H2><P>Christ's death was all-terminating, all-redeeming, life-releasing, and new-man-creating. In His death He terminated all the old things and redeemed all of God's creation. He also released His divine life and created the new man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Passing through Death on the Cross</H2><P>Christ as the embodiment of God and through the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14) passed through the death on the cross. Because the One who passed through death was the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9), the Triune God was passing through the death on the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Terminating All the Negative Things<br>in the Whole Universe</H2><P>By, in, and through this death He terminated all the negative things in the whole universe. These negative things are Satan, the devil, the enemy of God (Heb. 2:14); sin (Rom. 8:3; John 1:29); the flesh of fallen man (Gal. 5:24); the world, the cosmos, the evil system of Satan (John 12:31); the old creation, represented by the old man (Rom. 6:6); and the separating ordinances of the law (Eph. 2:15). Not only the Jews but also all the nations have their ordinances. Ordinances are the forms or ways of living and worship, which create enmity and division. All the ordinances have been crucified on the cross. Christ has crossed out all the ordinances. In 1938 I was invited to visit a group of Japanese believers in Manchuria. When I visited them, I dropped my ordinances by taking off my shoes and kneeling down on the tatami to talk to them about Christ. To practice the proper church life, all ordinances should be repudiated and dropped.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Accomplishing Redemption</H2><P>In His death Christ redeemed judicially fallen mankind and all things created by God (Col. 1:20; Heb. 2:9). Colossians 1:20 reveals that all things created by God both in the heavens and on the earth needed to be reconciled to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Releasing His Divine Life</H2><P>Christ redeemed all things judicially, according to God's righteous requirement. Then He released organically His divine life held in His human shell as that of a grain of wheat (John 12:24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Creating the One New Man</H2><P>Through His death Christ created in Himself as the sphere, as the realm, and as the element the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man (Eph. 2:15).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
