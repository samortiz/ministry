<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 Cor. 12:3</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>There is a lord of all things
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Everything has its lord.</li>
	<li>Who is the Lord of this great universe and the things therein?</li>
	<li>Who is your lord? Neither your parents, your husband, nor your wife is your lord. If you think they are, who will you belong to once they die? You will be a man without a lord.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The creator of all things
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The universe and all creation has its creator.</li>
	<li>Man also has a creator.</li>
	<li>The one who created all is the Lord of all. Since all things were created by Him, all things belong to Him. He is the Lord of all.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The ruler of all things
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>There is a ruler in creation.</li>
	<li>There is a ruler over man and within man&rsquo;s heart.</li>
	<li>This ruler is the Lord.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The redeemer of all things
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man needs redemption because he has sinned.</li>
	<li>The whole creation also needs redemption because it was corrupted through man&rsquo;s sin. This is clearly seen in the Bible.</li>
	<li>The redeemer of all is the Lord of all.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jesus is Lord
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus is the creator and the Lord of all.</li>
	<li>Jesus is the ruler of creation; as ruler, He is the Lord of all.</li>
	<li>Jesus is the redeemer of all creation; as the redeemer, He is the Lord of all.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to receive Jesus as Lord
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are created, ruled, and redeemed by Him.</li>
	<li>Repent, confess your sins, and receive Him as your Savior.</li>
	<li>Acknowledge that all that you are and have belong to Him, and that He is your Lord.</li>
	</ol></li>
