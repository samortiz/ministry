Messages Ten through Fifteen were given in a training to the church in Anaheim from September 21 through October 26, 1992
The word that we released has been more than clear, stressing that the group meeting is the crucial matter in the Lord's ordained way
We heard and received the word, and we even prayed much concerning this matter, but where is the definite building up of the groups?
Satan has deceived us, just as the serpent deceived Eve, through the practice of Christianity to pay attention to big meetings
The Greek phrase translated 'from house to house' implies that wherever there is a home of a Christian, there should be a meeting
Without the groups it will be difficult for them to remain, but if we have the groups, everything we do with them will be a success
We may still have some increase but the rate of increase will probably not be high and the atmosphere in our meetings also will not be high
The increase in those localities was reduced because they had only the big meetings without the proper group meetings
We must find the remedy for our imperfect situation in gaining the Caucasians in a country such as the United States
Because this is the United States, the majority of the saints in the churches in this country should be Caucasian
All the Caucasian brothers and sisters need to be burdened and consider so that they may be enabled by the Lord to find a way
If door knocking does not work, how could the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses have had a considerable success in door knocking?
According to statistics, in the past century the rate of increase has been highest among these two heretical groups
They may decide that they do not like our kind of church and may then seek to find a church among the Caucasians
In our consideration concerning the way to form the groups, we must pay our attention mainly to the Caucasians
Our deficiency in gaining the Caucasians in the past might be because we grouped saints from other races with the Caucasians
In forming the groups, it may not be wise to group the Chinese-speaking and the Spanish-speaking saints with the Caucasian saints
Realizing our situation, our environment, and the condition of our work, we should pray, 'Lord, we do not have the wisdom
One thing we do know: it is very difficult for us to gain the Caucasians, and it is even more difficult for us to retain them
According to my observation, they do not feel that there is anything that interests them enough to cause them to stay
They have not arrived at the stage where they seek the Lord according to the deeper truth that we have released
To speak of grouping the saints together is easy, but to find the proper way to form the groups and to carry them on is difficult
According to the Greek, this phrase means that the believers met by houses, taking the house as the basic unit for their meeting
Without the members brought in through the group meetings, we could not have the coming together of the whole church
There are many common and ordinary things that we do not know how to do simply because we never did those things
To form the groups in the new way there is no need to touch any of the existing church meetings or group meetings
Both the way of prayer and the way of arrangement are needed in order to have the proper forming of the groups
If you had been practicing the proper grouping, within one hour after one of the group members became ill, you would have known it
After opening to one another concerning our present situation, we should pray for one another and care for and help one another
Because we do not open ourselves to one another and do not have the mutual care for one another, we have lost our impact
When you go out to knock on doors, even the unbelievers can sense that between the two or three of you there are some problems
With such oneness and impact, surely the unbelievers will make the decision within themselves that they would like to join themselves to you
Perhaps they will not understand clearly what you preach to them, but after you leave they may say to one another, 'These people are sincere
Based on our former practice in Taipei, we learned that our way of baptizing people quickly should be reconsidered
After praying in seeking the Lord's leading to form your group, you need to pray much concerning whom you should visit for the gospel
Thank You that You have exposed us, that You have shown us our shortage, and that You have shown us what You need
Lord, we thank You for all these things, yet we are still ignorant concerning the proper experience of the group meetings
Lord, cover us from all these things that we may have a clear, pure, and even purified fellowship so that You can show us Your way
The New Testament shows us clearly that in the beginning of the church life the meetings were first in the homes
The record in the New Testament does not make the group meetings as definite as what is being revealed to us today
The reason for this may be that the divine revelation is always released after the experiences of God's people
If the message was good, the meeting would be a success; if the message was not good, the meeting would be a failure
According to our history, whenever a church reached an attendance of one hundred, the rate of increase became reduced
We began to trust in the big meetings and began to do everything to support, maintain, enrich, and uplift the big meetings
When we first went to the island of Taiwan from mainland China, the number of saints throughout the island was from three to five hundred
After the turmoil, in approximately 1958, the practice of group meetings nearly ceased, and the rate of increase was much reduced
In addition to the regular meetings of the church, there is the need for some to pick up the burden and form new groups
The first thing the two of you must do in your group meeting is to get yourselves closely joined in spirit and in your environment
You must know each companion's age, the name of his wife, the number and ages of his children, the schools the children attend, and so forth
The second step is to pray together and fellowship together in order to know each other in a thorough and intimate way
At most, two or three from your group should go, but in order to find out who should go, you need to study your candidates and pray
In your first visit with someone who has been recommended to you, do not stay very long; the shorter the visit, the better
In that special meeting, the first thing to do is to give them a short message concerning baptism and baptize the new ones
Because they are baptized in a baptistry with a number of people surrounding them, they will feel very stately
After this you can have the Lord's table with all the baptized ones and fellowship with them about the Lord's table
In the practice of the group meetings, as much as possible the Caucasian saints should not be grouped together with the Chinese saints
Eventually, such a special meeting for baptism and the practice of the Lord's table with the new ones should be conducted every week
In a place where there is only one baptistry, the different meetings by the different groups could be scheduled for different times
All the brothers who formed the group initially can teach and shepherd, but we cannot expect that the new ones will be able to go very fast
In the long run there will be a great need, but at the present time we must take the initial step to form the groups in a simple way
In the new start with the group meetings, the remaining aspects of the church's present practice can remain the same
We desire to follow You to perform the Father's plan, God's economy, and to take care of the growth in life, to have the real spirituality
The Lord has shown us many things, and He has brought us into many situations and through many different kinds of experiences
We not only have such a background, but now in the recovery there are more than twelve hundred churches around the globe
We cannot go on to take the new way as we have seen it, and yet forget our background and our present situation
From the very beginning we were led by the Lord in this way, and we have never deviated from this kind of seeking
The denominations depend on their activities, and the Pentecostals depend on their superstitious trust in the Holy Spirit
You need to pray for a few days, perhaps even for one or two weeks, waiting on the Lord to give you a proper partner
Before you go to visit the first acquaintance, you may need to study his situation for a considerable length of time
They study others' markets, prices, and merchandise so that they can find a way to attract buyers and make a profit
According to the parable given there by the Lord , we need to use the 'capital' that He has given us to gain a profit for Him
If we labor in this way fifty-two weeks a year, we should easily gain three remaining ones for the Lord in a year
Whether we gain one this year or do not gain one, we can still live; we can still come to the Lord's table to enjoy the Lord
It is not adequate to merely take with you a copy of The Mystery of Human Life and speak the same thing to everyone whom you contact
We need someone to labor in order to write some suitable materials for the group meetings that will nourish the new ones with milk
In order to have the profitable teaching and fellowship in the group meetings, some materials that can serve as a guideline are needed
According to our present situation, we need to consider what would be the best time for us to bring the new ones to the church meetings
Dear Lord, we are in a position of not knowing how to go on in taking care of the increase, the spreading, of Your recovery
It will be very difficult for us to have the proper practice of the group meetings if we have no leadership at all
Some, however, sat in back before they were appointed to be elders, but once they became elders they spontaneously came to the front
Today we are very clear and definitely burdened to have a new beginning in practicing the group meetings to care for these many churches
By using these materials properly we can build up the new ones within one year to do the same things that we do
We have released many points concerning the group meetings, but the saints may still not know how to carry them out
If we allow the saints to form the groups freely, without any training, the groups that are formed may not be proper
After Paul preached the gospel in several cities, he returned to visit the churches and appointed elders there
Although Paul practiced this way, he did not write concerning the appointing of elders and deacons in the early days of his ministry
Paul's practice and teaching indicates the principle of incarnation: the Spirit works, but He works through man
An initial training of the saints is very important because out of it the groups will be produced in a proper way
Those who volunteer for the vital groups should be formed into groups, and then they should be trained and regulated
We should first form ourselves into an acting, working, moving group by getting acquainted, built up, and trained
If the group gains people little by little, it will not be difficult to follow up on and care for the new ones
After becoming two groups, everyone will be able to work because they have already become acquainted and have had practice and training
Perhaps our progress will be slower than this, but we anticipate that this way will be successful if everyone will labor
After forming new groups and going to gain new persons, we need to consider when and how to introduce the new ones to the church meetings
If we do not bring the new ones to the church meeting on the Lord's Day but go ourselves, we will neglect the new ones
For the Caucasian new ones it may be better to have a separate meeting on the Lord's Day besides the regular church meeting
Besides these, we still have other week nights and the Lord's Day afternoon and evening for the group way of meeting and serving
When they come into the church meetings they will not be surprised, because they will have already come into the proper meeting life
In order to have the Lord's table in the group meetings, we need to teach the new ones concerning the Lord's table
It may be better not to bring the new ones to the church meeting until we have had the Lord's table with them in the group meetings
They may attend both the church meetings and the group meetings, or they may have the capacity to attend only the group meetings
To meet and be baptized on the Lord's Day in the meeting hall will be more proper in the eyes of many of the new ones
They may be disappointed if the Lord's Day meeting is not in a proper place or if it is moved from place to place
Lord, do cleanse us again with Your precious blood that we may have a clear conscience with a crystal clear spirit in our fellowship
We do need Your leading that we may know what we should do in all the churches in Your recovery concerning this matter
In our speaking concerning the vital groups, we do not need to use terms such as 'the old way' or 'the new way'
In forming and practicing the groups, the principles should be the same in every church, but the particular steps do not need to be the same
We should form the groups with seven or eight members in each group, and we should also select leaders for each group
We should simply tell the leaders that they should fulfill the responsibility of a leader without assuming the position of a leader
If one has the capacity, the burden, and the commission from the Lord, there may be the need for him to assume the apostleship
The Corinthians questioned Paul's apostleship, and the Judaizers claimed to be apostles in order to annul Paul's apostleship
They simply need to take care of their responsibility and fulfill their duty without having the thought and feeling that they are leaders
Within a year each group should double, at which point they should be divided, one group of sixteen becoming two groups of eight
We should not have just one man teaching; rather, we should practice mutual teaching through mutual inquiry and mutual answering
The matter of bringing the new ones into contact with the church should be carried out according to the situation
We can train all the members of the groups, but we may not be able to train all the members in the church life
All the serving ones must learn to be diligent, doing everything with diligence but not doing anything in haste
According to our present way of doing things, if the recovery were a commercial business, we would not succeed
In the spiritual sense, in the Lord's work we should be like those who are competing in business in order to make a profit
For a long period of time the rate of increase among us has been low, especially among the typical American people
In 1970 approximately three hundred saints migrated out of Los Angeles to several large cities in the United States
We prepared ourselves to meet in the Los Angeles Convention Center, which had a meeting capacity of three thousand
After we moved from Los Angeles to Orange County in 1974, two large Christian organizations in Orange County began to oppose us
For approximately ten years, from 1976 until 1986, it was difficult for us to gain any Caucasians, especially in Orange County
The rate of increase in other parts of the United States has been better, but in Orange County the rate of increase has been very low
Brother Nee once said that if a Christian has never been beside himself, he is not qualified to be a Christian
The Bible tells us that whenever the people of God come together, they should make not merely a joyful voice, but a joyful noise
In John 17 the Lord Jesus said that when His disciples are one in the Triune God the whole world will believe that He was sent by the Father
Often when we go out to visit people by twos and threes, the people whom we visit may realize that there is no oneness among us
If two or three of us go out as one man, the people whom we visit will realize that there is a dynamic power among us
Without our speaking anything, people will be convinced because they see us loving one another in oneness and with one accord
On the whole earth, in every society everyone knows that whenever people group together, there is struggling and fighting
Regardless of how much others oppose us, if we are such people, nothing can prevent us from gaining the proper increase
In some cases if a husband and wife are put in different groups, they will be made alive and they will be more able to help others
In a certain sense, in the church life the husbands and wives are not couples but are individual members of the Body
We need to be coordinated not according to the natural relationship but according to the membership in the Body
At home the husbands and wives are couples, but in the church they are individual members, irrespective of their marital status
In addition, we can have a general English-speaking group, including those from different races who can speak English well
As much as possible it may be better to keep the Caucasians separate and particular to serve the purpose of gaining Caucasians
Nothing in our Christian life can touch our life, open our eyes, and usher us into the reality of what Christ is more than prayer
Out of all those who volunteer to participate in the English-speaking groups, the majority should be Caucasians
Even those who have been in the church life for only a short time cannot avoid the tendency of oldness from the atmosphere in the churches
Based on our past experience, we may feel that we know how to attend a group meeting, but actually, we do not know
In the entire Bible the Lord required many things first of mankind, then of His chosen people, and then of the church
If we would do the same thing that we have been doing for the past fifteen years, surely we will not gain the increase
If we love something and take care of that more than the Lord's interests, when the Lord Jesus comes, we will miss the rapture
They should be very useful for the Lord's purpose, yet many have been annulled not by sin or by lust but by their character
According to recently published statistics, out of two hundred thirty million Americans, one hundred thirty million profess to be Christians
The entire Christianity is drugged, and we too are somewhat drugged by the influence of the surrounding Christianity
We need a new beginning then we can go out to gain the new ones and they will not be defiled by the contagious germs in todays Christianity
The first matter in this training will be to train the vital group members concerning how to pray in the new way to meet the new need
Our way of prayer has become a form; week after week we pray in a habitual way, repeating the same prayers to the Lord
There is no need for us to pray long prayers in which we teach, explain, and expound the Scriptures to the Lord
In praying for the matter of fruit-bearing, some of the saints have prayed, 'Thank You, Lord, You are the vine and we are the branches
We have been spoiled by the condition of the church and have picked up many bad habits, yet we think that these are good
Now we are desperate with the Lord to have a new beginning with a new start by first building up the vital groups
To recover the first love, or the best love, is to give the Lord Jesus the preeminence, the first place, in everything
Although today we are still in the recovery and in the oneness, we need to realize that the oneness among us is not a living oneness
In John 17 the Lord said that if we have this oneness, the people of the world will know that Christ is the One who was sent by the Father
They will realize that with us there is something heavenly, something divine, that the people of the world could never have
The worldly people cannot be one, yet we are one in a living way, so that our oneness is expressed and is realized by others
They were fishermen, but they left their nets, their boat, their job, and their father to follow the Lord Jesus
Eventually, they saw the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension of the Lord, and that kept them more in oneness
By fellowshipping together in the group meetings, all the members will enter into one accord, and in this one accord they can pray
We might have met in the same locality with certain saints for years without knowing their name or the name of their spouse
Among us there is the desperate lack of the exercise of our spirit, the renewing of our mind, and the determination from our will
We have the living Lord, we have the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit, and we have a regenerated spirit
Those in the groups need a time with their group to practice what they have heard the prayer the real revival from within and the fellowship
There are two crucial matters in the New Testament that we all need to pay attention to: the oneness and the one accord
The Lord's prayer in John 17 followed His discourse in John 14-16, in which He released the mystery of the Divine Trinity
In His prayer to the Father, He used the word We , referring to Himself and the Father, with the Spirit also implied
It is easy to define oneness: oneness is the Triune God mingled with all His believers, and this oneness is just the Body of Christ
Eventually, the one accord, or the harmony of inward feeling among the believers, becomes like a melody, like music
According to their concept, denominations are not divisions; they are merely means used by Christians to carry out their work
In their view denominations are like the different kinds of bowls and utensils that people use to eat their food
After listening to such an argument, they may be subdued and agree with the claim that the denominations are not divisive
If we examine our situation, we will have to admit that even now we are not adequate in the matter of one accord
Without the one accord, it is difficult to get people saved, converted, and regenerated by the dynamic salvation of God
Our sickness is not just like a sickness in the outward, physical body; our sickness is like a sickness in the heart within the body
Because of this it is hard for the Lord to answer our prayer especially in the matter of fruitbearing for the increase of the Lords recovery
The grouping of the saints together in the vital groups is to recover us, and to recover us means to heal us, to cure us
That fellowship actually is Christ Himself, because Christ is the element of the fellowship, and He is the sphere of the fellowship
In the vital groups we need to fellowship concerning our status, our spiritual condition, and our present situation in and with the Lord
Our hearts will also be softened toward one another, and we will be able to receive something from one another
The Lord Jesus built up the oneness between Peter, John, James, and all the others who followed Him for three and a half years
It seems that they did not gain anything during those three and a half years; but something was built up within them
The outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost was the greatest thing that ever took place in the entire universe
The Triune God poured Himself out upon these people who were in the oneness and in the fellowship and who had the genuine one accord
The making of dough requires the blending of grains of wheat; but before being blended, the grains need to be ground into fine flour
According to the type of the meal offering in Leviticus 2:1-13, to be blended requires the adding of oil so that the flour will not be dry
If by the Lord's mercy we are able to experience such a blending, we will be absolutely different from what we are today
The reason that we are so easily attracted to the department stores is that within us something corresponds with the department stores
The department store managers have prepared the merchandise in their stores to correspond with our sinful nature
In general, a rough person does not have many peculiarities; the more fine a person is, the more peculiarities he has
After so much confessing we will have no more confidence in ourselves and no more trust in our natural ability
To keep the oneness of the Spirit we need to condemn all the self-exalting views and drop all the divisive opinions
Some of the saints may feel confident that they are more knowledgeable and can do things better than the elders of the church
To keep the oneness of the Body in the one accord, we need to forsake all self-preferences and disregard all personal tastes
Finally, to keep the oneness of the Spirit, we need to follow the Spirit's direction and respect our fellow members' feeling
We must turn to the spirit to follow the direction of the Holy Spirit within us, and we must respect and take care of others' feeling
For the building up of the vital groups, we need to make, with much and thorough prayer, a corporate Nazarite's consecration for the Lord
According to the New Testament principle, all the believers are and should be overcomers , but the majority have become degraded
It is difficult for the entire church to be a corporate overcomer, but individual saints within the churches should be overcomers
Because the church has become degraded it is not what it should be hence there is the need of the overcomers to replace the degraded church
For the building up of the vital groups, we need to pray much and thoroughly for the four steps of the God-ordained way
Instead of practicing the fellowship, we have practiced hypocrisy for years; we have all been hiding ourselves under a mask
Because of this, it is difficult for us to have an intimate and thorough fellowship that results in our being blended together
Because we do not like people to know us, we have become very sensitive, and our being sensitive causes us to be very touchy
From the time the recovery came to the United States the Lord has not been able to carry out the grouping among us
A number of saints came into the recovery in a very strong way and remained with us, but at a certain point they left
We who have remained in the recovery all have the problems of our disposition and character that keep us separate from one another
After coming together in our groups, we should be free to tell the others concerning our inward situation with the Lord
If we continue to hide ourselves and keep a distance from one another, when we go out to visit people, we will not have the impact
When they were together following the Lord as His believers, they were genuine, as seen in the fact that they fought with one another
In Matthew 20, while the Lord Jesus was unveiling His death and resurrection to them , it seems that they did not hear what He was speaking
Some of you pray much in a habitual way in the prayer meetings, but in your prayer it is hard to realize any unveiling or revelation
We must first deal with our natural way and our natural person our natural being which includes our natural prayer and our natural speaking
A few saints among us can be either silent, not doing or saying anything, or when they do function, they can be very expressive
We should not believe that in one prayer the Lord would burden us with that many aspects and with that many items
All the rest, including Nicodemus, were not there for the economical filling of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
Eventually, those who remained in an absolute way for God's purpose after the Lord's earthly ministry were the one hundred twenty
They stayed together, they lived together, they ate together, and they lodged together for ten days, doing nothing but praying
On earth at that time, there was only one group whose prayer touched the heart of God and His throne in the heavens
The church actually was initiated from the first day that the Lord Jesus came out to work at the age of thirty
On the evening of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came to them, breathed into them, and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
The resurrected Christ dwelt in the disciples because He had breathed Himself as the Spirit into them on the day of His resurrection
Now that we have seen that we need to be blended together, we may still not know what to do in order to be blended
Some nice people have set themselves up as a pattern, hoping and expecting that others in the church would be like them
If we are under the Lord's enlightening, we will realize that our thinking, our intention, and our desire are all evil
If we have not been dealt with to such an extent in our contact with the Lord, we can never be blended with others
QUESTION: Is it wrong not to be able to pray in a group if you feel like someone has done something against you?
ANSWER: In this period of time, we should pray only for our blending and for the activities of the vital groups
According to our natural being, we may pray too much and too long, not caring for others but only for our own feeling
We have been building up ourselves for too long, so it is really hard for the Spirit to do anything through us
If we are willing to be corrected and rescued from our habitual ways, this will be a big blessing to the church meetings
The Greek word for one accord is homothumadon, from homo, meaning same, and thumos, meaning mind, will, purpose
According to the God-ordained way, it should be our spirit that is strong to direct our soul, even to control our entire being
Today we desire to be blended, and our being blended will surely produce a one accord in our spirit under the direction of the Spirit
In the book of Acts, we can see that the one hundred twenty practiced the Lord's command to pray in harmony, to pray in one accord
In the evening of the day of resurrection, the Lord came to the disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them
We did not realize anything about this until the day we received the Lord in time as the reality of regeneration
By reading the New Testament we can see the difference between what the disciples were in the Gospels and what they were in Acts
Even though the disciples followed the Lord quite faithfully in His earthly ministry, they were either in the mind or in the flesh
It is very difficult for the brothers and sisters who are used to praying long prayers to have a change to pray in a short way
They explain to the Lord why they need to pray, or they give the Lord directions about how to answer their prayer
Even our attendance in the prayer meeting was very low at one time, and the persons who prayed mostly were dead and dying
The prayers in the prayer meeting have been long prayers full of explaining to the Lord and of giving the Lord descriptions and instructions
The three thousand who were gained on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the prayers of the Spirit with a real burden
Acts 6:4 also tells us that the apostles made the decision to continue steadfastly in prayer and the ministry of the word
In Ephesians 6:18 Paul said that we need to pray at every time in spirit and watch unto this in all perseverance
If we want to continue steadfastly in prayer, we need to schedule and even to budget our time in the way that we would budget our money
If you make a decision beginning from tomorrow to pray at certain times be prepared for things in the environment rising up to frustrate you
Throughout the days of the year, no one knocked on your door at this time except after you made the decision to use this time to pray
Our attitude in our prayer should be that we are now with our King and that we would not be interrupted from having this time with Him
During this time we should consider that we are away from home because we are busy with our King, with our Lord
Acts 1:14 says that the one hundred twenty continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer, 'together with the women
The Lord has blessed us with the laborers, with the material supply, and with the fruitful result in His move in Russia
The second stanza has the word seclusion, the third stanza has the word self-deception, and the fourth stanza has the word pretension
We need to learn to pray without description, without explanation, and slowly and clearly enough so that others can follow us
The Lord said in Matthew 13:33 that the woman took and hid the leaven in the three measures of meal until 'the whole was leavened'
Paul in 1 Corinthians 14 told us clearly that when we are praying to God, we are also praying for other people to understand
Of course, the mothers need to care for their children, but they should not take this as an excuse for always missing the prayer meeting
When Abraham was asked by God to get out of that idolatrous country, he could not leave his father or his nephew
When you play the piano, your whole being, all your muscles and all your cells, have to coordinate to release your spirit
When we say 'Amen' in the meetings, we should always say it with the exercise of the spirit and the release of the Spirit
If we are in the presence of a living person for even a short time, it will be hard for us to avoid being inspired by him
All of us have to rise up to function in a living way in order to annul the system of one man speaking and the rest listening
We need to participate in the outpouring of the Spirit of power as the power from on high and as the dynamic impact
We have to see that the one divine Spirit is of two sides: the inner side and the outer side, the essential side and the economical side
The essential side refers to the indwelling Spirit as our spiritual essence, our spiritual life, and our spiritual person
Based upon this, we can go on to participate in the outpouring of the Spirit of power, who is the economical Spirit for God's economy
Now that we have been regenerated, we need to realize that the Bible charges us to do one unique thing, that is, to pray
Without the prayer, we may have the teaching, the fellowship, and the breaking of bread, but we do not have a conclusion
To our life, to our work, to everything within us, and to everything outside of us, the prayer is the conclusion
Acts 6:4 tells us that the apostles made the decision to continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word
In Ephesians 6:18 the apostle Paul charges us to pray at every time in spirit and watch unto this in all perseverance and petition
Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, the economical Holy Spirit, for the preaching to the rulers and elders of Israel
After beseeching, all the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit for speaking the word of God with boldness
Saul was filled with the Holy Spirit at the beginning of his Christian life to receive his sight and be baptized
The Bible says that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit came into us, Christ came into us, and God the Father came into us
In order to touch this outward aspect, there is the need of a connection, a bridge, and this bridge is our prayer
We should abandon the Pentecostal concept of having to pray for many days with fasting in order to receive the power from on high
On the one hand, we should be the most crazy people, but on the other hand, we should be very formal and proper
We have the Spirit within us, Christ within us, and God the Father within us, but we are not living because we do not pray
As the Body of Christ, we have the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father, and we are mingled with the Divine Trinity
Through our prayer, we will be ready to go to reach people, because we will participate in the power from on high as the dynamic impact
The United States is a country of freedom, but those in the United States military service give up their freedom
To a church meeting, you may come late, and no one will say anything to you, but to a training meeting, you are obligated to come on time
In the training we are willing to give up our freedom so that we can be perfected to be more useful to the Lord
If we would love prayer and consider prayer the way that we consider talking on the telephone, we would have much time to pray
We have to change our concept, the concept of thinking that people can be saved and brought into the church life in a quick way
If you can gain one sinner to the extent that he is fully in the church life as a normal member within two years, this is wonderful
You may think that you are being trained to be 'magicians' who can instantly bring in big results, but this concept is wrong
Spiritually speaking, however, we are short of children because we do not practice the God-ordained way to gain the increase
We have to learn to preach the gospel in a trained way, not in a way that is according to our disposition, character, and peculiar traits
They cannot be good nurses if they work according to their disposition, their character, and their peculiar traits
Many nurses, however, do not make their patients feel happy and pleasant, because of their particular disposition
Because of this training with the vital groups, the church prayer meeting here has been greatly helped and rescued
We may exercise our spirit only when we feel we have to pray or speak something, but we must exercise our spirit at all times
Corinthians 3:18 shows us that as we behold the Lord with an unveiled face, we are being transformed into His image
Our former way of prayer was not the prayer from the new creation but the prayer from the old creation according to the old and natural way
You may have a certain outward appearance as a cloak, but there is no real transformation taking place within you
As the very God, He became a man, and He was a perfect man; but even this perfect man had to pass through death and resurrection
In the church life, a number of us behave and act according to what we are, and what we are is absolutely natural
Transformation implies a kind of metabolism; it is an inward change by the addition of a new element into the very essence of our being
Who is being renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of the One who has passed through death and resurrection?
Gradually, we have drifted into practicing a routine church life, but where is the Spirit and where is the leading of the Lord?
The husbands need such a confession to the Lord of their inner feeling, attitude, expression, tone, and word toward their wives
Transfuse Yourself as the Spirit into my being, my constitution, and pour out Yourself as the Spirit of power upon me'
A mother may lose her temper with her children, but even if she would confess her defeat to the Lord, it is not a good model
We are not fighting against blood and flesh but against the principalities, powers, and rulers in the heavenlies
While a sister is washing the dishes, she can have this list nearby and pray, 'Lord, remember Sister So-and-so; remember Brother So-and-so
We should not think that it is enough to have left the denominations and to be meeting together on the ground of oneness
We are a group of people serving the Lord faithfully, but we are serving and meeting in a mere routine and scheduled way
Regardless, we have to learn how to prepare ourselves and how to prepare our candidates, the objects of our work
We must find a way to get 'warm' doors, doors of people whom we know or who have been recommended to us by others
After we choose our gospel candidates, we have to consider what book or what verses of the Bible we can use with them
We need to receive the fellowship in these messages so that we can be renewed, transformed, and conformed to Christ's image
Spontaneously, we will be persons in the meeting who are releasing the Spirit in our praying, praising, singing, and speaking for the Lord
In order to be living and vital members in the church life, we must practice the five aforementioned items all the time
We need much preparation before we can have the impact in going out to reach people for the increase of the church
Although we may know the truth concerning the four steps of the God-ordained way, we have not properly practiced them
When a child is at the beginning stages of learning how to play the piano, it is difficult for him and he may not be that interested in it
We agree that the group meetings are eighty percent of the church life, but how many are really interested in the group meetings?
We need to pray and ask the Lord which ones we should concentrate on first as candidates for our gospel service
In order to carry out the Lord's burden in the vital groups, we must be renewed persons and we must learn how to serve the Lord in every way
Paul said that he offered to God the sinners saved by his gospel preaching as spiritual sacrifices, as members of Christ
In 1 Peter 2:5 the priesthood is not the priests' service, but the priestly body, and that body surely is the Body of Christ
To tell out God's virtues is the preaching of the gospel of God's salvation in His virtues according to our experiences
To preach the gospel is to tell out the virtues of our Savior, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light
We must be burdened to gain more members for the increase of the Body of Christ and for the accomplishment of God's economy
In Haggai 1:8 Jehovah charges His people by saying, 'Go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house'
We need to bring the ones whom we save into the church life, which is for the building up of the Body of Christ
We are burdened to save sinners so that they can be regenerated and then transformed to be proper materials built up into the Body of Christ
One is the loving concern of the Father for sinners, and the other is the real burden for converting sinners into members of Christ
Even when we do save some, it seems that we are merely winning souls instead of converting sinners into the members of the Body of Christ
God's heart today is for only two things: to save sinners and to accomplish the building up of the Body of Christ
If we do not pray and if we do not pick up this burden, it is meaningless for us to participate in the vital groups
In this section of the meeting, there should be the elements of fellowshipping and interceding, caring, shepherding, and visitation
In the group meetings, we should fellowship freely, sing freely, pray freely, and ask and answer questions freely without formality
We should be 'crazy' in the Spirit, but our craziness should be spontaneous and normal, not a kind of demonstration or performance
Another person may say, 'We were told that we need to be dealt with in our disposition, character, and peculiar traits
Our doing things carelessly is not according to our birth but according to our habit by practice to become a part of our character
To have the mutual fellowship about the significance of dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiar traits can be very profitable
We do not really care whether or not a certain brother comes to the meeting or whether or not a certain sister is sick
One sister may point out that another sister in the group is absent because she is having some particular trouble
If we see brothers who are in need and merely tell them that the Lord will take care of them, that is not love
He thinks that we talk much about God's economy, but that this has nothing to do with our present need in our daily life
Once a brother is loved in some practical care, that impresses him and incites him to think about the Christian life and about God's economy
Paul said that we should consider one another so as to incite one another to love and good works, not abandoning our own assembling together
Hebrews 10:25 says that in the group meetings we should exhort one another, and so much the more as we see the day drawing near
We say that our group should be blended, but our blending has not been completed, because we do not know each other thoroughly
We need to endeavor to put all the things we have covered in this training into our practice in the vital groups
In order to deal with our disposition, character, and peculiarity, we need to see a vision that we have been crucified on the cross
We should pray, 'Lord, thank You that on the cross You have crucified my disposition, my character, and my peculiarity'
We have to learn practically in our daily life to be dealt with very finely in our disposition, character, and peculiarity
Sometimes we might think certain brothers and sisters have made some improvement, but their improvement is questionable
The real improvement must be because of the particular dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiarity
If we do not have some definite and practical experiences in this, we cannot have the real improvement in life
Over ninety percent of our growth in life depends upon the dealing with our disposition, character, and peculiarity
Even in coming to the meeting and finding a seat in the meeting, he does not obey the Spirit, but he obeys his peculiarity
In this message we will touch the matter of mutual teaching in the group meetings by mutual asking and mutual answering
As a new one, he may have a number of questions to ask concerning matters that he does not understand, especially from verses 12-36
At the time we were saved it might have seemed that some chains fell off from us and we were released from sin temporarily
For the long run, every day we are still enslaved to sin, not outside as with chains, but inside with a bondage
The cause of their losing their tempers was not a chain that was upon them outwardly but a power, a slavery, in their constitution
The very life which is Christ Himself has been given into us, and this life shines and becomes light within us
The bondage of our temper is not a chain on our shoulders; it is something in our constitution, in our being, in our fallen nature
When the Triune God as life works within us and when this life shines, this shining frees us from all these negative things
As a young child is learning mathematics, every lesson may seem difficult, but after he completes the lessons, they seem very easy
Christianity had convinced the saints and subdued them to the uttermost, causing them to believe that they could do nothing
The enemy, Satan, has been fighting and attacking from the beginning of the recovery in the United States in 1962
It seems that we understand the doctrines, but when it comes to the matter of teaching, we may think that it is too difficult
Otherwise, when we come together with the new ones, no one will have anything to ask, and no one will have anything to answer
In the previous message we mentioned the matter of dealing with our disposition, our character, and our peculiar traits
In Matthew 16:24 the Lord said, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
They think that the more sentences, phrases, and clauses they speak, the better people will be able to understand them
To be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith'
We need to prepare ourselves by considering how to teach all the subjects that we have picked up in the recovery
If you do not know how to teach these matters, you can look into some of our books in order to prepare yourself
When the groups come together, they should practice this kind of mutual asking, mutual answering, and mutual teaching
To speak in a natural way, to gossip, to murmur, and to complain are all quite easy, but to teach the divine truths is not easy
In the vital groups we need to reach the goal of carrying out the mutual teaching through mutual asking and mutual answering
More than fifty years ago Brother Nee saw the light in 1 Corinthians 14 concerning all the believers prophesying in the church meetings
Brother Nee published two books-The Normal Christian Church Life and Church Affairs -in which he spoke of this matter
Since the end of the Second World War in 1945 very few renowned speakers have been raised up in Christianity especially in the United States
Over this period of time, the attempts of a few spiritual men to bring in a spiritual revival in America have not been successful
In a certain sense, whether the number of saints in the churches of the Lord's recovery is large or small is not very significant
The fact that few will enter through the narrow gate and walk the constricted way does not mean that the Lord Jesus will suffer a defeat
How we need to thank the Lord that today we have a Bible that has been not only translated but also interpreted
Today, if you desire to know Genesis, there is a book called Life-study of Genesis that contains one hundred twenty messages on Genesis
In Jeremiah 15:19 Jehovah told Jeremiah, 'If you bring out the precious from the worthless, / You will be as My mouth'
It was then that Jehovah told Jeremiah, in reference to his speaking, to bring out the precious from the worthless
In Zephaniah 3:9 in His salvation to the Gentiles Jehovah promised to 'change the language of the peoples / Into a pure language'
If you will practice my fellowship for six months, your capacity to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, will be increased
We need to learn to speak loudly slowly clearly and officially in a weighty way that imparts some definite points of the truth to others
To speak something in the meetings is absolutely different from speaking in any other kind of environment or circumstance
In contrast, the speaking of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels was brief, fitting, purified, clean, and without wasted words
Under the Lord's inner restricting, you should learn not to speak unnecessarily to anyone, but just to talk to the Lord
We may not say anything sinful, and we may not criticize anyone; we may want only to relate some information to people
If we will go along with the Lord and cut off our unnecessary talk, the Lord will use our mouth to speak His word
Whether we speak to our spouse, to our children, or to the brothers, we need to learn to speak only what is worthwhile
We need to learn to be 'official'; that is, we should learn not to speak lightly, but carefully, speaking every word in an 'official' way
Immediately we will all need to know how to nourish the newborn spiritual babes that they may be kept and preserved
After a short time, we will all need to bring these babes into our vital groups to perfect them through mutual teaching
At the present time there may be more than twelve hundred local churches on the earth outside of mainland China
In Southern California there are now forty-nine churches, and the total number of saints is approximately three thousand
In general, the rate of increase depends on the way we labor in the gospel, and also on the environment and the people
In Russia, in a short time of approximately one year, two large churches have been raised up, one in Moscow and another in St
We should not be comfortable concerning the present situation of the Lord's recovery, especially regarding the matter of increase
With the exception of Russia the situation everywherein America in Europe and in the Far Eastis about the same with regard to the increase
No doubt the recovery is wonderful, but some aspects of the recovery are not encouraging, especially the matter of increase
Eventually, my going to Taiwan to carry out the God-ordained way to build up the church stirred up much opposition
We need to see that the degradation of Christianity is completely and absolutely due to the absence, the shortage, of the divine revelation
These two messages were entitled The Ministry of the New Testament and The Teaching and the Fellowship of the Apostles
The Body of Christ as the church has been constituted not with by-laws or by a charter, but with Christ Himself as the element of life
The Triune God in eternity came in incarnation to become a sower to sow Himself as the seed into the human heart
It was produced by a kind of constitution with Christ Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God to be the life seed sown into our being
The constitution of the Body of Christ is with life, and the building up of the Body of Christ is by the growth in life
When we have the constitution with life, the growth of Christ in life, and the transformation by life, we are ready to be built up
The last three points we need to see are the ministry of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship of the apostles
In 1969 a brother who used to be among us said that we received only one man's ministry, whereas he desired to receive all ministries
All the proper ministries of all the proper ministers are the one ministry, which is the unique New Testament ministry
Brother Nee was in the line of the eternal plan of God concerning Christ and concerning the church in life with the Spirit
It is not just to teach typology or prophecy but to teach concerning God's New Testament economy so that the Body of Christ can be built up
That meant that after the Lord's death and resurrection, the Spirit of reality would come to the apostles and unveil more to them
The word of God here is concerning the mystery , which is Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
Without Paul's fourteen Epistles, the holy word concerning the divine revelation of this mystery could never have been completed
Who could write a book like Revelation with the seven lampstands, seven Spirits, seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls?
Since we all have seen this, we must be persons who live in the Spirit, walk in the Spirit, and do everything in the Spirit
Degraded Christianity makes things so complicated, but actually the Christian life, the church life, is the simplest life
We may realize that certain persons are too proud, too much in their mind, too philosophical, or too emotional
If you find out a certain person is emotional with a bad temper, you should be very careful not to touch his temper
Always say something, do something, and express something to others in a very natural way, without trying to correct them
While we are praying inwardly, we should simply follow the Lord's leading to speak something in a very natural way
In the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him; thus the two speak together
He read some notes to this young man out of the Recovery Version concerning the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1
When that young man realized that this brother was meeting in a local church in the Lord's recovery, he became critical
He prayed for one person on his list for a long time, and that man was eventually saved after George Muller died
Our neighbors should be considered as our second circle, and our classmates and colleagues as our third circle
The Lord told His disciples that they would be His witnesses in Jerusalem , in Judea , in Samaria , and to the uttermost parts of the earth
Verse 12 says that we are being perfected unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ
Because the saints in Ephesus had received Paul's perfecting, he was able to write the marvelous Epistle of Ephesians to them
Chapter one of Ephesians reveals the dispensing of the Divine Trinity and the transfusing of the ascended Christ
Our marriage union with Christ is in chapter five, and our fighting the spiritual warfare for dealing with God's enemy is in chapter six
Since we are regenerated believers in Christ, our human spirit and the Holy Spirit are mingled together as one spirit
We may not have any telephone calls for a long period of time, but as soon as we begin to pray, the telephone will ring
We need to look to the Lord so that we can free ourselves from all distractions to have solid times of prayer with Him
When we read this list prayerfully, we will have some kind of inner registration of the two or three whom we should labor on now
We need to consider all of our acquaintances, and we need the proper discernment in our consideration of whom we should labor on
We should spend our time to labor on those whom we consider to be promising and not waste our time on others who are not open
We need to consider people's condition, especially spiritually, and then act appropriately to meet their need in the gospel
A person may have a question, and although you may speak many things from the Bible to answer him, he will not receive anything
Within a short time this person will be helped to know what eternal life is, who is eternal life, and how he can receive this life
You also need to know the proper Bible verses, especially those verses which are referred to as 'golden verses'
After we go to contact a person, the following week we should give a report in the group meeting of our experience
We must remember that in our gospel labor we are fishers of men , and human society is like a big ocean full of fish
If a person goes to a store to buy something, and the store does not carry what he wants, he will go away unhappy
Our success in reaching people with the gospel for the increase of the Body of Christ all depends upon our practice
We should not hope that within three months someone will be saved and within another half year another one will be saved
When you share this with him, make sure you refer him to some verses in the Bible which show that we have God's life and nature
Since we are lovers of the Lord Jesus, we must realize that we have much to learn in order to be a proper Christian
While a mother is taking care of her children, she can look for opportunities to open up her Bible and read a verse
To have or to partake of God's divine nature has something to do with escaping the corruption which is in the world by lust
Of course, in your prayer and your petition, whenever you open up your mouth to say something to the Lord, that is a kind of fellowship
The best verse for Christ's redemption is Romans 3:24- 'Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus'
Verse 25 speaks of Christ being the propitiation place, which refers to the lid, the cover, of the ark in the Holy of Holies
We also need to realize that verses 14 through 16 of John 3 show us that Christ was crucified on the cross that we may have eternal life
Romans 95 says Whose are the fathers and out of whom as regards what is according to flesh is the Christ who is over all God blessed forever
They also twist John 1:1 which says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
These questions show us how we need to spend our time to learn the Bible, so that we can meet the need of the new ones
Many of the groups have been coming together to pray earnestly and have been laboring for about seven months, but what has come out of this?
The outward situation among us may not seem that encouraging because we have not yet seen some definite results
We need to consider the Lord's word to us in the Gospels regarding preaching the gospel and gaining the increase
At the end of Luke, the Lord told the disciples to wait at Jerusalem until they would be clothed with power from on high
We may expect such power and instant results in our gospel labor, but we need to go on to see what the Gospel of John says
Without these fish, and even on land, where there were no fish, the Lord prepared fish and bread for His disciples
After Peter's responses to His questions, the Lord charged him to feed His lambs, shepherd His sheep, and feed His sheep
If you look at the vine today, it seems that it is the same as it was yesterday because the season has not yet come for it to bear fruit
Someone may want fruit from the vine right away, but the vine cannot produce this fruit until its season comes through suffering
We should not think that our meeting together for about seven months in the vital groups has been a wasted time
If someone asks you what you are doing in your group, it would be wonderful to hear you say, 'We just cannot live without prayer
We need to pray desperately, 'Lord, we ask You, when the season comes, to give each one of us two people who are remaining fruit
There is no verse in the New Testament which tells us that the closer we are to the Lord's coming, the better the church will be
We still need the church life that can maintain us in the overcoming life, but we should not be satisfied just to be in the church
If you feel that some of your candidates can be brought to the church life in the Lord's Day morning meeting, you may do this
They may have a religious background, but they do not want to go to their denomination because it does not satisfy them
All the time you have to keep them in a feeling that you are ministering to them something really spiritual of Christ
Through the mutual teaching in the groups the new ones are perfected unto the work of the ministry as pointed out in Ephesians 4:12
We had drifted away from the practice of the group meetings to a kind of Sunday morning service with one speaker
We have to realize that a big and top advantage of the group meetings is that they should make everyone function
If the saints who have the burden to be in the vital groups do not move, do not act, in any kind of meeting, the church is finished
We have made it clear that the way to produce the vital groups is that each of us must take the lead to be vital
It is in this prayer life that we pray ourselves into the Spirit-the essential Spirit, the economical Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit
A number of the saints may be weaker and older, and they do not have the capacity to act that much and be in the vital groups
We should not go to contact them first but go to contact the ones whom we feel can be made vital and whom we can bring into our vital groups
In these days we need to go to contact the ones who can be made vital, including certain ones who have backslidden
When we bring two more to join our group and we reach ten saints, we should divide our group into two groups of five each
Someone else may have one contact with this backslidden one, and he may want to go to your group meeting just through that one contact
Previously we said that we need to wait and consider when the time is ripe for us to bring a new one to the group meeting
When a group of five brings a new one in, they should all work on that one to fully recover him, revive him, and make him vital
Perhaps a brother who is being recovered would come to our meeting and ask, 'Why has the church become so dormant'?
We all have to function, and we must be prepared to make mistakes and learn from these mistakes to be perfected
We also need to have a vital group meeting one evening a week in addition to the regular meetings of the church
If we have the burden to recover someone who has not been in the meetings for a long time, we need to pray for him
We should tell the Lord that we do not want to be dormant and that we do not want others in the church to be dormant
If our vital group meetings are full of truth, are living, and if we intimately love one another in the group, this will be a big attraction
Brother Watchman Nee stressed that the priesthood in the New Testament is universal, so he encouraged all the saints to serve, to be priests
The most prevailing way to bring all the saints into function is for them to enter into the group meetings in a living and active way
The church social life in the recovery leads to light, to the deeper and higher truths, and to the divine life
If a new one comes into a group meeting and all the members of the group meeting speak, he will be surprised and attracted
If a new one comes to our group and sees this kind of intimate, open, thorough fellowship and mutual care, he will be inspired
He would say that he has never seen people who are so one and who love, open to, and care for one another so much
Sixteen years after the war, the recovery came, and the recovery was greatly welcomed by this remnant of seeking ones
That was the first stage of the recovery in the United States, and it lasted for about nine years, from 1962 to 1971
In those years, much of the increase came from my visits to many places and people throughout the United States
In order to deal with this opposition and proclaim the truth, we put an article in the newspaper every Saturday for three and a half months
We also repeatedly tried to contact the writers and publishers of the two evil, defamatory books against us, but they rejected us
It was in Albuquerque that we made the decision to appeal to our 'Caesar,' just as Paul did to preserve his ministry
In those early years, nearly everyone among us was a real seeking one who would pay any price to follow the Lord absolutely for His interest
Worldliness, the opposition, and the denominations are three layers of obstacles to the Lord's recovery in the United States
We were raised up to stand on the ground of the church, the genuine ground of oneness, which is a testimony against all the denominations
Worldliness, the opposition, and the denominations are three blockades to gaining the proper increase in the Lord's recovery
In the last five years, beginning in 1987, there has been turmoil caused by certain factious ones who have caused divisions
In spite of this turmoil, the churches in Southern California had an increase of close to thirty percent per year over the last five years
With all of this fellowship as a background, we can see how difficult it is for us to gain the typical, middle-aged Caucasians
If a group of people are meeting together and are a real vital group-living and active-whoever comes in and sees this will be convinced
If we are vital sooner or later in our neighborhood and among our relatives colleagues classmates and friends we will meet some seeking ones
We must learn diligently and practice absolutely to be vital then there is much possibility for us to gain a good number of the seeking ones
We can spend only a certain amount of time to recover the backsliding ones because we have the sinners and the new ones waiting for our help
When we contact a backsliding one, the first thing we have to learn is how to say something definite and to the point
Maybe after six months, someone would be brought back to the Lord through the impression which he received of you
If someone is down or discouraged and listens to the speaking of some who are so vital, he will become vitalized
What we speak may be good, but it will not be effectual if we do not have our spirit exercised with the Holy Spirit expressed
If these ones are filled inwardly with the Spirit and experience the outpouring of the Spirit, they will change and become different persons
Certain quiet and shy ones need to learn to exercise their spirit and their voice so that the Holy Spirit can be expressed
When you pray adequately, spontaneously you will have the infilling of the Spirit and the outpouring of the Spirit
Each week you need to have a group meeting, and you also need to set aside a day or an evening for the purpose of contacting people
We have to believe that what we are doing by the vital groups will not be in vain, because this is a very practical sowing
The accompanying outline gives basic instructions concerning how to take care of each of these categories of people
When you talk to people, spontaneously you will know how to handle them according to what kind of persons they are
Also accompanying this message, on page 253, is an outline entitled How to Produce and Establish a Vital Group in the Church Life
