<h2 class="head1">II. THE ARCHANGEL MICHAEL AND HIS ANGELS WARRING WITH THE DRAGON</h2><p>Why will Michael and the angels not fight the dragon now? The reason is that they are not the legal and qualified executors. They are simply the policemen. We, the man-child, will be the legal and qualified executors. As we have seen, after we have spoken our executing word, the captain and his policemen will fight against the enemy.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Having Contended with the Devil<br />about the Body of Moses</h2><p>The Bible reveals the names of two angels&mdash;Michael and Gabriel. Gabriel is a reporter bringing news to God&rsquo;s people (Dan. 8:16; 9:21-22; Luke 1:19, 26), whereas Michael is a fighter contending for God&rsquo;s people (Dan. 10:13,21; 11:1; 12:1; Jude 9; Rev. 12:7). Jude 9 reveals that Michael the archangel contended with the Devil about the body of Moses. God had a purpose for Moses&rsquo; body. Moses had to be present on the Mount of Transfiguration and, according to chapter eleven, he must return to be one of the two witnesses. Hence, God had to preserve his body. Satan, however, wanted to destroy it. But Michael fought against Satan regarding this.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Having Fought the Princes of Satan<br />for the People of Israel</h2><p>Daniel 10:13, 21 and 11:1 have unveiled that Michael has fought the princes of Satan for the people of Israel. Michael has always been a fighter for the interests of God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Now Fighting the Dragon<br />to Cast Him out of Heaven to Earth</h2><p>Michael has been fighting throughout the centuries. When the man-child is raptured to heaven and gives Michael the word, he will fight once more against the dragon to cast him out of the heavens to the earth. I want to be there to see this take place, to execute the word, and to see Michael act upon it. I hope that many of us will be there.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE DRAGON AND HIS ANGELS WARRING</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Having Not Prevailed</h2><p>Verses 7 and 8 say, &ldquo;And the dragon warred and his angels; and they did not prevail.&rdquo; &ldquo;His angels&rdquo; should be the fallen angels who follow Satan to rebel against God (Matt. 25:41). Satan will never be victorious against Michael and his angels. He will be defeated.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Having No Place Any Longer in Heaven</h2><p>Verse 8 also says of the dragon and his angels that &ldquo;neither was their place found any longer in heaven.&rdquo; Having been defeated, there no longer will be any place for the dragon and his angels in heaven.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being Cast with His Angels<br />out of Heaven to Earth</h2><p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;And the great dragon was cast out, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.&rdquo; We see here that the dragon and his angels will be cast down to the earth. This will take place at the beginning of the fifth trumpet. Revelation 9:1 says, &ldquo;And the fifth angel trumpeted and I saw a star out of heaven fallen to the earth and to him was given the key of the shaft of the abyss.&rdquo; The &ldquo;star&rdquo; in this verse is Satan. After he has fallen from heaven to earth, he will use the key to the abyss to cause the torment of the fifth trumpet. At that time, the shaft of the abyss will be opened and demon-possessed locusts will emerge from it. We have already pointed out that these locusts will torment men for five months. Recall that the fifth trumpet will mark the beginning of the last three and a half years. After Satan, the heavenly star, has been cast down to earth, his time will be very short, only three and a half years.</p>
