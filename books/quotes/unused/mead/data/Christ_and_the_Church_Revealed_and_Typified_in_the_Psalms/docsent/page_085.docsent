   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After passing through the first one hundred and forty-five Psalms, we are now on the peak.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All we have to do now is to shout "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last five Psalms 146, 147, 148, 149, and 150 begin and end in every case with Hallelujah.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>PRAISE FOR THE CITY AND FOR THE LORD'S REIGN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Firstly there is praise in Psalm 146 for God's reigning in Christ through Zion.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regardless of what kind of being I am, though I am weak or strong, I will still sing praises to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 10 the Psalmist gives the reason for his praise: "The Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise ye the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the main point of Psalm 146.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"The Lord shall reign for ever O Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Zion is the city, and the Lord's reigning is for the earth.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 12: "Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It does not say, "Praise the Lord, O saints," or, "Praise thy God, O David."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It says, "Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the city.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 13 and 14: "For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here in the city we have the strengthening, the blessing, the peacemaking, and an abundant supply of the best food.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Psalm 147 is a Psalm of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is really marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>PRAISE FROM THE HEAVENS TO THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Psalm 148 the praise starts from the heavens and transfers to the earth.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let them praise the name of the Lord" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verses 7 and 11 to 14 the praise moves to the earth: "Praise the Lord from the earth Kings of the earth, and all peoples; princes, and all judges of the earth: both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: let them praise the name of the Lord: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now Psalm 8 is fulfilled: O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth.'</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Praise ye the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 14 mentions that the Lord exalts two things: the horn of His people, and the praise of all His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not say that we are too loud in our praising.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we praise, the Lord exalts our praises.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must be even more loud in extolling Him, "for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There are no new points in Psalm 148.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is a Psalm of praise beginning from the heavens and coming to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Psalm 149 is another Psalm concerning the city and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"Praise ye the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Zion is the city, and the King Christ is for the earth.</S>

   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The saints are joyful in glory because now they are in the Kingdom, now they are reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Let them sing aloud upon their beds in the night, not only in the day; in the bedroom, not only in the living room or in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"Let the high praises of God be in their mouth not the low praises , and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the nations, and punishments upon the peoples; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this honor have all his saints.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hallelujah" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At this time the saints are reigning over the earth and executing the judgment of the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Psalm 149 is another Psalm of the city and of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These last five Psalms are all Psalms of praise for the house, the city and the earth, and mostly for the city, because it has come to its ultimate consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Revelation 21 describes the final scene in the entire Bible it is a revelation of the city for the earth, the New Jerusalem and the earth, with all the kings bringing their presents into it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Eventually we just have the city and the earth.</S>
