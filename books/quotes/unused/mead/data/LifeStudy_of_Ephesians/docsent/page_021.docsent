   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REDEMPTION IN GOD S BELOVED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO FULFILL GOD S RIGHTEOUS REQUIREMENT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND TO PLEASE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although God delights in us and has made us the objects of His grace, we still need redemption because He is the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our Father who delights in us is righteous and cannot tolerate unrighteousness, wrongdoings, or offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such things insult His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, His righteousness makes the accomplishment of redemption necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Redemption fulfills God s righteous requirements and pleases God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is not only a God of love; He is also righteous, and anything unrighteous displeases Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Everything related to Him must satisfy the requirements of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the reason that, in order to please God, the beloved Son had to go to the cross to accomplish full redemption for God s chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THROUGH HIS BLOOD SHED ON THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>FOR OUR SINS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Son s redemption is through His blood shed on the cross for our sins 1 Pet 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the Son s death in the flesh on the cross has fulfilled God s righteous requirement, His blood becomes the very instrument for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>REDEMPTION THROUGH HIS BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BEING THE FORGIVENESS OF OUR OFFENSES</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Son s redemption through His blood is the forgiveness of our offenses Matt 26:28; Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Redemption is what Christ has accomplished for our offenses; forgiveness is what Christ accomplished applied to our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Redemption was accomplished on the cross, whereas forgiveness is applied the moment we believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Redemption and forgiveness are actually two ends of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have seen that the forgiveness of offenses is the redemption accomplished through the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, two terms are used because this one thing has two ends: the end of the accomplishment on the cross and the end of the application to us at the time we believed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although redemption was accomplished on the cross when Christ shed His blood, it was not applied to us at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The application did not take place until we believed in Christ and made confession to the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that very moment, the Spirit of God applied to us the redemption Christ had accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, redemption is the accomplishment, and forgiveness is the application.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>V. ACCORDING TO THE RICHES OF HIS GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 7 says that redemption is according to the riches of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to our concept, it would be easy for God to forgive us because He is sovereign and almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, it was not that easy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The accomplishment of redemption was a very weighty and serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of its seriousness, it required the riches of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we need to consider why redemption required the riches of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Bible says that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, in order for us to be forgiven, blood had to be shed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in this matter the blood of animals could not avail Heb 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The blood of the animal sacrifices was simply a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the actual accomplishment of redemption, there had to be the blood of a higher life, a blood altogether sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where could God find this kind of blood among the human race?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was impossible because all men are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Among the fallen human race there is no sinless blood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Moreover, God s chosen ones number in the millions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a sin offering were to be offered for each one, millions of sin offerings would be required.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, in addition to a perfect, sinless blood, there was the need of a sin offering that could include millions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This indicates that the blood through which redemption was to be accomplished had to be not only sinless, but also all-inclusive, able to redeem the millions of God s chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only Jesus Christ could be the sin offering with a sinless blood shed for these millions of chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By the shedding of His blood once upon the cross, the eternal redemption of God s chosen ones was accomplished once for all Heb 9:28; 10:10, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now we need to see how it was possible for God to obtain such a sinless and all-inclusive blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Obtaining such a blood was vastly more difficult than creating the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to create the universe, God simply had to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, He said, Let there be light, and there was light Gen 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But redemption could not take place in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God could not simply say, Let redemption be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order for God to create the universe there was no need of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But for Him to accomplish redemption, there was the need of the riches of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Consider how the Redeemer, the Lord Jesus, was conceived.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order for the Lord Jesus to be conceived, there was the need for the Holy Spirit to contact the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot say how the Holy Spirit conceived the Redeemer within the womb of the virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For this, the riches of God s grace were required.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to Luke 1:35, the child conceived in Mary of the Holy Spirit was called the holy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This indicates that the conception of the Lord Jesus was absolutely a holy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Holiness refers to something conceived of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For nine months this holy thing remained in Mary s womb.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Who can tell how much grace this called for?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What grace was needed for Jesus, Jehovah the Savior, to remain there in the womb for nine months!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Until the age of thirty, the Lord Jesus worked as a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Great grace was required for the One called Emmanuel, God with us, to work as a carpenter for so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Eventually, He came forth to begin His ministry, which lasted three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although He was concerned for sinners, they opposed Him, persecuted Him, and plotted to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Betrayed by one of His Apostles, He was arrested.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Actually, He was not arrested, but handed Himself over to those who came for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He could have asked the Father to send twelve legions of angels to rescue Him, but He refrained from doing so Matt 26:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After He was arrested, He was tried before the high priest, before Pilate, and before Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then He was nailed to the cross and hung there for six hours, from nine o clock in the morning until three o clock in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What great grace was needed for all this!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>On the cross the Lord Jesus died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then He was buried, resurrected, and ascended into heaven to receive repentance and forgiveness Acts 5:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Because of the riches of God s grace, we are able to repent and receive forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do not think that your repentance originated with you.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>No, God the Father gave repentance to the Son, the Redeemer, and He gave it to you through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Along with repentance, we have received forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All this is according to the riches of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>How limitless and immeasurable is God s grace!</S>
