But once we answer His demand, we will feel refreshed and happy within. Whenever we feel that Christ has a demand within us and we answer this demand, we will feel happy. When He demands, He also supplies. Only such ones can testify of and share Christ's riches, transcendence, and excellence. The Christian life should be like a piano; the important thing is not how it looks outwardly but whether or not it plays the right tune. (I am not saying this to encourage you to be loose in the outward things.)</p><p>I hope that more brothers and sisters can be raised up to touch Christ's inward demands. Some brothers and sisters have heard messages concerning consecration and the handing over of one's all. They may have witnessed the burning consecration and handing over of the other brothers and sisters, and they may have decided to follow suit and do the same. However, it is not enough for them to be zealous, to consecrate themselves, and to hand themselves over. Their consecration and handing over must issue from a genuine demand within. Handing over enables us to become sensitive to the Lord's demands; it also enables us to enjoy the precious Lord in a richer way.</p><p>Once we meet the Lord's demand in an absolute way, we will find His demands easy and light. If we only partially answer it, we will find it hard to fulfill. It is very difficult to answer sixty or seventy percent of the Lord's call. But it is easy to answer one hundred percent of His calling. If a man does not answer His call, he will not be happy. If he answers His call only halfway, he will be even less happy. If he answers His call reluctantly, he will find himself struggling. Only those who lay everything on the altar receive the most abundant joy and supply. Today we should only worry about not answering His call enough. It is hard for a Christian to go on if he drags his feet. May the Lord be merciful to us. May we be clear that the Christian pathway today has everything to do with Christ within us. We should follow Christ; we should answer His demand within. This is our way to serve. This is the way of life. Let me repeat: We judge our Christian life by the sense of strength, sweetness, comfort, clarity, and light.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY OUR FAILURE<br />TO ANSWER THE LORD'S DEMAND</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Today we can find two kinds of brothers and sisters in the church. Many brothers and sisters are happy, but a few are sad. Perhaps you can find both kinds of Christians sitting right beside you. If I were to ask you to nominate the happiest people here, the ones who have no problems would surely say that they are the ones. If anyone is not happy and if anyone has doubts about himself, surely he must have some kind of problem, some kind of spiritual sickness. The main reason for this sickness is that the Lord has a demand that has not been answered. This is a matter of experience; it is not a matter of doctrine. If you say, "Before you two brothers spoke, I was quite happy. Now your speaking has taken away my happiness," this is because our message conveys the demand of Christ. If a Christian does not answer this demand, he will be sad. Our doctrine, speaking, and exhortation do not serve the basic need. Our voice is like the sound from the loudspeakers; we only amplify the demand of Christ within and make it clearer.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TODAY BEING TO OBEY THE INNER VOICE</h2><p>If the brothers and sisters hear this voice but are reluctant to answer the Lord's call, then I can only say that it is too late. If you do not want to be a Christian, it is better that you never started. Today the life of Christ is in you; it is impossible for you to no longer be a Christian. Since you are a Christian, you should resolve within to follow the brothers. Why can you not answer the call of the Lord's great love? For many years, you have quenched, suppressed, and limited the inner voice with money, the world, and worries. None of our teachings are new doctrines in these days. We are merely telling you what you should be hearing every day. We are not speaking fresh words here, and we have no interest to speak anything special. We are telling you the facts. The more things a Christian holds in his hand, the more he suffers. In the end he will be like the young ruler, going away in sorrow. If you forsake everything, however, you will rejoice like Zaccheus and experience salvation (Luke 18:1-9).</p><p>If an unbeliever is brought here and hears such a word, he will surely go away, saying, "These speakers must have something wrong in their mind. How can they ask anyone to give up everything?" When unbelievers hear such a word, they will not be pricked; some may even consider our words to be a kind of joke. Only those who truly have Christ in them as life will know the meaning of our word. To be a Christian, we have to be one in such a reckless way; we have to take such a reckless pathway. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would see the Christian pathway now.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
