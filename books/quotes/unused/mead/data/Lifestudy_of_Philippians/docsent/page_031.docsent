   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MIND WHICH WAS IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider verses 5 through 8 in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 5 Paul says, Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek words translated let this mind be in you can also be rendered think this in you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word this refers to the counting and regarding in verses 3 and 4.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This kind of thinking, mind, attitude, was also in Christ when He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, and humbled Himself, being found in fashion as a man vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To have such a mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To experience Christ, we need to be one with Him to such an extent, that is, in His tender inward feeling and in His thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE STEPS OF CHRIST S HUMILIATION</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 6 says, Who subsisting in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Greek word rendered subsisting denotes existing from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It implies the Lord s eternal preexistence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word form refers to the expression, not the fashion, of God s being Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is identified with the essence and nature of God s Person and thus expresses His essence and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This refers to Christ s deity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 6 Paul tells us that Christ did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the Lord was equal with God, He did not consider this equality a treasure to be grasped and retained.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, He laid aside the form of God, not the nature of God, and emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Emptying Himself</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>and Taking the Form of a Slave</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 7 goes on to say that Christ emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Christ emptied Himself, He laid aside what He possessed the form of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word form in verse 7 is the same word as used for the form of God in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In His incarnation, the Lord did not alter His divine nature, but only His outward expression of the form of God to that of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was not a change of essence; it was a change of state.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word becoming indicates entering into a new state.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Becoming in the Likeness of Men</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to verse 7, Christ became in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ s deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He appeared outwardly to men as a man, but inwardly He had the reality of deity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Humbling Himself and Becoming Obedient</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>unto the Death of the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 8 continues, And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man by men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word fashion implies the outward guise, the semblance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What Christ looked like in His humanity was found by men to be in fashion as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Being found in fashion as a man, Christ humbled Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First He emptied Himself by putting aside the form, the outward expression, of His deity and becoming in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then He humbled Himself by becoming obedient even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ was God with the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although He was equal with God, He put aside this equality and emptied Himself by taking the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that He became a man through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then, being found in the appearance of a man, He humbled Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that when He was a man, He did not insist on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, He humbled Himself to the point of dying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is Christ as our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Humbling Himself was a further step in emptying Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ s self-humbling manifests His self-emptying.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The death of the cross was the climax of Christ s humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To the Jews this was a curse Deut 21:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To the Gentiles it was a death sentence imposed upon malefactors and slaves Matt 27:16-17, 20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, it was a shameful thing Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord s humiliation involves seven steps: emptying Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men, humbling Himself, becoming obedient, being obedient even unto death, and being obedient unto the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>LIVING A CRUCIFIED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The pattern presented in these verses is now the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This life is what we call a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The seven steps of Christ s humiliation are all aspects of the crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although Christ had the expression of deity, He laid aside this expression.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, He did not lay aside the reality of His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He laid aside the higher form, the form of God, and took on a much lower form, the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this, He emptied Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Surely this is a mark of a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then, after becoming a man and being found in the appearance of a man, Christ humbled Himself even unto the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This was the crucified life lived out in a full and absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ is not only an outward pattern for us; He is also the life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As this inner life, He would have us experience Him and thereby live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this crucified life there is no room for rivalry, vainglory, or self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the contrary, there is self-emptying and self-humbling.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whenever we experience Christ and live Christ, we automatically live such a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This means that when we live Christ, we live the One who is the pattern of a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then we also shall empty ourselves and humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we did not have the crucified life within us, we could never live according to the pattern presented in Philippians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only the crucified life can live such a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we still do things out of rivalry and vainglory or are still ambitious to be leaders or elders, we are not living a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are not emptying ourselves or humbling ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, we have a life within us that truly is a self-emptying and self-humbling life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This life never grasps at something as a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Instead, it is always willing to lay aside position and title.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>THE PATTERN BECOMING OUR SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the pattern in Philippians 2 becomes our inward life, the pattern becomes our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then we are saved from rivalry and vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If the Philippians were not willing to live according to this pattern, they could not make Paul s joy full.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He would still be troubled by their rivalry and vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But if they were willing to live the crucified life, a life that always empties itself and humbles itself, not grasping anything as a treasure, they would have the genuine experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Their experience of Christ as such a pattern and inward life would make the apostle extremely happy.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Living a crucified life shows that toward the apostles we have encouragement in Christ, consolation of love, fellowship of spirit, and tenderheartedness and compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Only when we live a crucified life can we make the apostles happy and cause their joy to be full.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In prison Paul was not concerned with how he was treated by others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>His concern was whether or not the believers would take Christ as their pattern and live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This was the desire of Paul s heart, and only this would make his joy full.</S>
