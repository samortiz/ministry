   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE EIGHTEEN GROWTH IN LIFE AND ITS RESULTS 4 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:5, 9-10 GROWING UNTO SALVATION FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider 2:5, 9 and 10.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 5 says, You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In reading this verse we need to take care of grammar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 4 is a modifier of the subject of the sentence in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The main part of the sentence in verse 5 is this: You...are being built up a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, the main thought here is that of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This thought continues the thought in verse 2 of growing unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that following salvation we have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Growing unto salvation is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that here salvation involves not only transformation, but also includes being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a totality, salvation in 1 Peter 2 indicates transformation for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Salvation at the end of verse 2 is related to transformation for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Notice that at the end of verse 2 there is a comma, not a period.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 3 we have a condition related to drinking the milk of the word: If you have tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 3 concludes with a semicolon, and verse 4 ends with a comma.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the punctuation indicates that the main clause in the second part of the sentence is in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, verse 5 is the direct continuation of verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 2 ends with the thought of growing unto salvation, which implies that salvation includes transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then verse 5 continues by indicating that this transformation is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason we say that salvation in verse 2 is a matter of transformation for building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that we have touched the thought in Peter s mind and heart as he was writing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In these verses Peter seems to be saying, You believers have all been regenerated, and now you are as newborn babes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As newborn babes, you should hunger and thirst for the milk in the word so that you may grow unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This salvation is transformation for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These must have been Peter s thoughts as he was writing this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we write a letter or article, we first have certain thoughts within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then gradually we write according to these thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was Peter s situation when he wrote this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He had the thought that the believers had been regenerated to become newborn babes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now they should long for the milk in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the guileless milk in the word they could grow unto a salvation that was transformation for their building up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Having these thoughts within him, Peter went on to compose this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, Peter s composition may not seem very good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But, on the other hand, spiritually speaking, Peter s composition is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If Peter had not written the way he did, not all of the points covered could have been included.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, because it is sometimes difficult to understand Peter, we need help to grasp the various points he covers in his writings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the reason we are having this Life-study.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I can testify that for more than fifty years I have been digging into the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1956 the Lord began to show me His building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First Peter 2 is a very important section in the New Testament related to God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I was in Manila in 1956, I began to see from 1 Peter 2 that salvation includes transformation and that this transformation is for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Few Christians have a proper understanding of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, many have not seen the matter of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before you came into the Lord s recovery, did you ever hear a message on transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in the recovery many messages have been given on the subject of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In December 1962, I gave a conference on the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then in 1963 I began to speak in this country on transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That year I gave at least twenty messages on transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although the light concerning transformation and building was given to me years ago, this light has never left me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, it has always been with me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It took me years of study to see these things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, I can say that without the help rendered through these messages, you may find it difficult to understand what Peter is saying about salvation, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Praise the Lord that regeneration has made us newborn babes!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As newborn babes, we all should long for the guileless milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then by this milk we shall grow unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This salvation is transformation, and transformation is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Feeding on Christ by the nourishing milk in the Word of God is not only for growing in life; it is also for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Growing is for building up.</S>
