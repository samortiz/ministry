In 1971 these messages were published with some added material by the Gospel Book Room, Taipei, Taiwan.</p><p> </p><h2 class="head2">"Godhead" Defined</h2><p>In the following pages, the word <i>Godhead</i> (Gk. <span class="greek">&Theta;&epsilon;&oacute;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>), is used several times. The following definition is given for readers who may be unfamiliar with the term.</p><p><i>Godhead</i> (Gk. <span class="greek">&Theta;&epsilon;&oacute;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>), used in Colossians 2:9, refers to what God is as the Deity and as an object of worship.</p><p><i>Divinity</i> (Gk. <span class="greek">&theta;&epsilon;&iota;&oacute;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>), used in Romans 1:20, refers to the divine nature of God.</p><p>We, the children of God, are born of Him and therefore possess His divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4).
