<H1 CLASS=MSG>Message Nine</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>The Glorification of Christ<br>by God with His Glory</H1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Gospel of John, a full revelation of Christ as the Word of God defining God and revealing God, is composed of two sections:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The first section, from 1:1 to 12:19, unveils:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Christ's becoming flesh in His incarnation.</li>		<li>And His earthly living and ministry in His humanity.</li>		</ol>	<li>The second section, from 12:20 to 20:29, unveils:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Christ to be glorified by God with His glory.</li>		<li>And the issue of His glorification through death and resurrection, as the many grains produced by the one grain in 12:24.</li>		</ol>	</ol><li>The glory of God is God Himself expressed&#151;Acts 7:2.</li><li>God the Father has given His glory to the Son, and this glory is the sonship to express God in His fullness&#151;John 5:26.</li><li>The glory of the Father was concealed in the shell of His humanity, His flesh.</li><li>He glorified the Father by manifesting Him in His earthly living and ministry&#151;John 17:4.</li><li>The Son prayed that the Father would glorify His name, and the Father answered Him, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again"&#151;John 12:28.</li><li>The Son has given the Father's glory to express the Father in His sonship to His believers (John 17:22), who are the many sons of God (Heb. 2:10) and share the same divine sonship with Him.</li><li>The Son, as the grain of wheat (John 12:24), expected that He would die (Luke 12:50) to have His shell of humanity broken that His divine glory might be released with His divine life to produce many grains, that is, many believers as His increase for the building up of His Body for the glorification of the Father.</li><li>At His last entry into Jerusalem under the exaltation of the people of Israel, some Greeks came to exalt Him, but He told them that that was the hour for Him not to be exalted by man but to be glorified by the Father, that is, to die to have His divine glory and life released in His resurrection&#151;John 12:12, 20-24.</li><li>It is in the second section of this book from 12:20 to 20:29 that the Son was crucified to have His human shell broken and His divine glory and life released in His resurrection for the dispensing of His divine life to His believers with which they could glorify the Father also. This matter is referred to in 12:23, 28; 13:31, 32; 14:13; 15:8; 17:1, 5, 10, 22, 24. It is also referred to in 7:39 and 12:16.</li><li>The Son prayed to the Father, "Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You"&#151;John 17:1.</li><li>The Father's house in 14:2, the vine in 15:5, and the child in 16:21, which implies the Body of Christ, are all the issues of this glorification of Christ through His death and resurrection.</li><li>God is glorified in Christ and in the church in the church age&#151;Eph. 3:21.</li><li>When the believers express God in their behavior, God is glorified&#151;Matt. 5:16.</li><li>When the believers as the branches bear much fruit, the Father is glorified&#151;John 15:8.</li><li>The believers who suffer with Christ in this age will be glorified in the kingdom age, that is, will reign with Him as His co-kings&#151;Rom. 8:17; 2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li><li>Peter was martyred so that God would be glorified&#151;John 21:19.</li><li>Eventually, all of God's chosen people will participate in the glory of the New Jerusalem, that is, will be glorified with the glory of God for eternity&#151;Rev. 21:11.</li></ol>
