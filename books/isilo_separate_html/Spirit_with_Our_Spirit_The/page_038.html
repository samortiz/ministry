We have seen that in God's creation, God paid the most attention to the creation of our spirit. Genesis 1:1 tells us that God created the heavens and the earth. Then verse 2 shows how the universe was damaged because of Satan's rebellion, telling us that the earth became waste and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. Genesis 1 goes on to show how God recovered the damaged universe. He recovered the earth by bringing in the light, and He caused the dry land to appear on the third day. Then He created all kinds of plant life and animal life. When God was creating man, the environment for man's existence had been fully prepared.</P><P>In God's creation, He also prepared a garden for man. God brought man into that garden, indicating that this garden would be man's residence. The garden of Eden was full of trees which were pleasant to the sight and good for food. Man was placed in the midst of this garden before the tree of life, alongside of which was another tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:8-9). This garden was a complete scene of the entire earth. The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies the evil one, Satan.</P><P>God brought Adam into that garden and charged him to be careful about his eating. He indicated that all the trees were good for food, including the tree of life. But there was one tree of which Adam was not to eat, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (vv. 16-17). Knowledge, good, and evil are three negative things. Life is the unique positive thing. Eventually, knowledge, good, and evil issue in death. The tree of life will lead you out of death, but the tree of knowledge, good, and evil results in death.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
