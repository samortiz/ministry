   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The following words are very precious: "And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head" v.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>31 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Upon the bed's head" corresponds to "leaning on the top of his staff," which is quoted in the book of Hebrews 11:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We believe that since the time he became lame he carried a staff.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, the staff spoke of his lameness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the other hand, it indicated that he was a sojourner.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now he worshipped God while leaning on the top of his staff.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By this he was saying to God, "Everything that You have done with me is the best that could be.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, I worship You."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter forty-eight he became sick, and Joseph brought his two sons to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He recognized God's name as "God Almighty."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not remember how he competed with his brother, how he gained the birthright, or how he took his brother's blessing, etc. All he remembered was his relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He continued to say, "And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt, before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These were the things he remembered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we touch his person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We see his attitude toward God and his attitude before men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows us clearly that he was now a different person, one with feeling and tenderness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he blessed Joseph's two sons, he laid his right hand on Ephraim's head and his left hand on Manasseh's head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although Ephraim was the younger and Manasseh was the firstborn, Israel laid his right hand on the head of the younger one and his left hand on the head of the firstborn, reversing the order.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Joseph saw this, he said, "Not so, my father."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What did Israel say?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said, "I know it, my son, I know it."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows us that Jacob knew what Isaac did not know; he was clearer than Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Isaac blessed his younger son, he was deceived into blessing him, but Israel was clear about what he was doing when he blessed Joseph's younger son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both Isaac's and Israel's eyes were dim because of age, but Israel's inner eyes were not dim.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Israel said, "I know it, my son, I know it."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He knew that God wanted to set Ephraim before Manasseh, that God wanted the older one to serve the younger.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here was a man who had entered into God's thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here was a man who had fellowshipped with God to such an extent and who had known God to such an extent that he could overcome the weakness of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What his physical eyes could not see, his inner eyes could see.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The shining of Israel had indeed reached the zenith!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After giving the blessing, he showed them that Egypt was not their home.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers" v. 21 . He was saying, "Although you are prospering in Egypt, Egypt is only a place where you sojourn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have God's purpose and God's promise, and we are God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After I die, God will be with you to lead you back to Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You must reach God's purpose."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the end, Jacob gathered his sons together to tell them the things that would happen to them in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In prophesying concerning his twelve sons, he touched incidents of their past.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was not easy for him to speak this way because as he talked about their past, it reminded him of his own past.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A son more or less bears the resemblance of his father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, when Jacob spoke of his sons' weaknesses, evil, and uncleanness, it was like speaking about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Jacob's words concerning his sons' past were actually descriptions of his own past.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What he said about his sons' future was not all that positive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nevertheless, his speaking was compassionate and full of kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We only need to consider one thing to find out the great difference between this person and the Jacob of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Simeon and Levi slew all the males in the city because of the incident with Dinah, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house" Gen 34:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was what he said at Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But now he mentioned it in another way: "Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honor, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel" 49:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What he saw now was not related to his personal interests but to sin and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Previously, he focused on self-profit, gains, and losses.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He thought, "What shall we do if the race of Shechem rises up and takes revenge on us for what you have done?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But now, he said, "Come not thou into their secret."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that he could not take part in such slaying and killing, that such cruelty was to be cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here we see a new Jacob, one who was washed, pure, and new.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He possessed a new character which he did not have before.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His prophecy concerning Dan's future was not that good; Dan would be serpentine in every respect and much rebellion would come out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At this point he immediately said, "I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord" v. 18 . He meant, "I cannot do anything about this kind of rebellion; I can only wait for God's salvation." These words reveal his new character.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>While he was prophesying, he was waiting for God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Genesis 49 contains Jacob's prophecies concerning his twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Eventually, all the prophecies regarding these twelve tribes came true.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Jacob was a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He had entered into and understood God's mind, and he told his sons what God would do.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Jacob knew more than Abraham and Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He was able to foretell the things that would happen to Manasseh, Ephraim, and the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This proves that he was a man who fellowshipped and communicated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Jacob was a hopeless person in his early years, but God nevertheless made a vessel out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He made a vessel out of the cunning, scheming, and self-willed Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The more we read about Jacob's later years, the more we sense his loveliness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Here was a man who was broken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Here was the constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This was the result of God's work on him step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We can only say that our God is full of wisdom, grace, and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He will always finish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After Jacob finished his prophecies, the Bible records, "All these are the twelve tribes of Israel" v. 28 . By the time Jacob was dying, the twelves tribes were formed; God's people was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Brothers and sisters, today God is also after a group of people to be His vessel to accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Through such a group of people, all the nations on the earth will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>What God did through Israel typifies what God wants to do through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The commission of the church is to accomplish the work of God's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The church is God's vessel in His recovery work.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To be the vessel in God's recovery work, the church needs to know the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This does not mean that we need someone to be an Abraham, an Isaac, and a Jacob separately.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It means that we must all know the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>After we have known Him, we will become His vessel to accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must never be satisfied with a little spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Word of God tells us that God wants us to be experienced in three aspects: in knowing the Father as Abraham did, in enjoying God as Isaac did, and in being disciplined by God as Jacob was.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>All these three are definite experiences and definite knowledge; they are not doctrines or letters.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>God intends to give us the vision, the revelation, and the discipline of the Holy Spirit so that He can lead us on step by step until we become the vessel for the accomplishment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>May God give us the grace to have such a clear vision.</S>
