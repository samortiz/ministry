   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIPPING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One of the most important and practical things in the life of a Christian is to live in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All those who desire to grow in life must pay attention to this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. THE MEANING OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fellowship which is ours is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 John 1:3b</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible the word fellowship means joint participation, partaking in common.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we believed into the Son of God, He entered into us, and we received the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result, this life flows within us, creating a flow between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This fellowship is carried on by the Spirit in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, it is also called the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2 Corinthians 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, our fellowship with the Lord is according to the Holy Spirit in our spirit in the flow of the divine life, that we may have a direct, intimate contact with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This keeps us in the participation and enjoyment of the divine love and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A LIFE OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>ABIDING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Christian life is a life of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No Christian can live normally apart from God or independently from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This relationship can be illustrated by that between the branches and the vine:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I the Lord am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him,...for apart from Me you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John 15:5</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our mutual abiding in the Lord is the mutual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every believer in Christ is a branch in this true vine of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once we see this fact, we should maintain the fellowship between us and the Lord, so that we will not be cut off from the enjoyment of His rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE CONDITIONS FOR FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Word of God and the believers experience, it is possible for this fellowship to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, in order to enjoy this fellowship with the Lord, we must fulfill some requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>WALKING IN THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1 John 1:7a</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we want to fellowship with Him, we must also be in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order for us to be in the light, we must abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we are not in the light, the fellowship is cut off, and we feel uneasy, empty, and darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CONFESSING OUR SINS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>1 John 1:9</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All unrighteousness is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sin means wrongdoing either against God or against men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once we sin, we must confess before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He will forgive us according to His Word and based upon the redemption of the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way the broken fellowship will be recovered, and we will have a conscience without offense to enjoy Him without interruption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>LOVING GOD AND THE BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>1 John 2:10</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is also love.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we live in God, spontaneously we love the brothers, which indicates that we are abiding in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE PRACTICE OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Most of the problems experienced by Christians are related to the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is very crucial that all the saved ones learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now let us look at some practical ways to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to our experience, these practical ways are mainly prayer and the reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have covered these two topics in the previous lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Here we will only point them out in a brief way, including the steps of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The purpose of prayer is to contact God and fellowship with God, not mainly to ask for things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are a few key points to prayer:</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>1 Speak the truth from the heart</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When you come before God, you should first calm down your thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then you should pray according to the inward sense.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not compose, and do not worry if you are saying the right thing or not.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Just come as a child comes to his parents, saying whatever you feel in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Let every word you utter be out of sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>2 Do not pray from memory</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>While you are fellowshipping with the Lord, do not try to recall all the things that you should pray for while neglecting to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not be so entangled with petty affairs that you lose God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>3 Under the enlightenment, confess your sins, relying on the blood</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In your prayer, if you feel that you have sinned, you should confess your sins thoroughly one by one, relying on the blood of Jesus, and ask God for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>4 Praise and give thanks</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After you have confessed your sins thoroughly, often you will want to express praise and thanksgiving to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You should do this uninhibitedly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>READING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When you read the Bible for fellowship, you must remember a few things:</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>1 Do not read for the sake of studying</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When reading the Word, avoid merely studying to gain knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You should turn to God in a simple and spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>2 Seek after the Lord with a single heart</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our Lord is in His Word; He Himself even is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When you read the Word you should come to contact this living person.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>3 Sense the nourishment and supply in the Word</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When you use your spirit to read the Word and to maintain your contact with the Lord, you will have the sense of enlightenment and satisfaction within.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>4 Turn the feelings you receive in the spirit into prayer</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In this kind of reading for fellowship, often you will touch the feelings of God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If you turn all these feelings into prayers to God, this will be the best fellowship you have with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In addition to the above, there are a few more practical points which you should take care of:</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>TIME</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>1 At every time</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>A Christian cannot be separated from God at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Whether in the morning or in the evening, he should exercise to have fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>2 Set aside a definite time</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>On the one hand, we need to live in the fellowship all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>On the other hand, we need to set aside a definite time to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The best time is in the early morning.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is also very good if we can spend some more time in the evening, or at any other time.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This will help our life of fellowship tremendously.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>1 In every place</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Whether at home, in the meeting hall, at school, in the office, on the road, in the car, or in any place, we can have fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>2 Select a place</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Although we can fellowship with the Lord anywhere, many times we need to find a quiet place for fellowship in order to avoid interruption and to enter in more singlemindedly and deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is also very important.</S>
