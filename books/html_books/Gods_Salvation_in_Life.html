Salvation in life means that God comes into us as life to save us. This salvation in life is not outward but inward because it is God Himself coming into us to be our life.<h2 class=head1>I. GOD&#8217;S ORIGINAL DESIRE AND PURPOSE-TO BE LIFE TO MAN WITH THE TREE OF LIFE AS A SYMBOL</h2><p>God&#8217;s desire and purpose in creating man is that He may be man&#8217;s life (Gen. 2:8-9), and this is symbolized by the tree of life (v. 9; Rev. 2:7b; 22:2, 14, 19). The Bible is a wonderful book. At the beginning, in the first two chapters, it speaks of how God created the universe with all the things therein including mankind. After reading these two chapters we may ask, &#8220;After creating man, what did God want man to do?&#8221; The readers will be surprised and also a little disappointed to learn that after God had created man, instead of telling man what to do, He prepared a garden for man. Those who have studied the Bible refer to this garden as &#8220;Paradise,&#8221; the Garden of Eden. God brought the created man into the garden and wanted him to live there.<p>There were two special trees in the garden. Actually, there were many trees in the garden, but two of them were special. One was called the tree of life. We all have heard of the apple tree, the grape vine, the apricot tree, and others, but we probably have not heard of the tree of life. The tree of life at the beginning of the Bible has become a big problem to Bible readers. Genesis chapter two was written three thousand five hundred years ago. Since then, readers of the Bible have been asking, &#8220;What is the tree of life?&#8221; However, no one can answer that question. Not only so, after mentioning the tree of life in the first two chapters, the Bible does not mention it again until at the end. In the Bible from Genesis chapter two, thousands of other things are mentioned, but you do not see the tree of life again until the very end of the sixty-six books. In the last two chapters of the entire Scriptures the tree of life reappears. This shows us that the Bible begins with the tree of life, and it also ends with the tree of life. The tree of life is the beginning and the conclusion of the Bible. Therefore, it must be something significant.<p>The tree of life in Genesis 2 shows us the desire of God. What was God&#8217;s desire concerning man when He created man? The Bible tells us that God created man in His image and according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26). Actually, what God created was not a man but a &#8220;god.&#8221; For example, if you try to make a dog, but you make it according to the human face and body, people would say that that is not a dog but a man. Genesis shows us that God created a man, but what He created had the appearance of God because this man looked like God in image and in likeness.<p>The Bible tells us that God created the heavens, the earth, the animals, the plants, and the creeping things, and then He created man. If you say that what God created was a man, I may argue with you and say that this man was actually God. What was God&#8217;s purpose in creating such a God-resembling man? In Genesis 2 we see that God placed the created man in front of the tree of life. This is very significant. God&#8217;s intention was for Adam to eat of the tree of life. Dietitians tell us that we are what we eat. Those who eat the tree of life will look like the tree of life.<p>What is the tree of life? This requires a careful study of the Bible. After Genesis 2, which mentions the tree of life, you must continue to read until you come to the Psalms. In Psalm 36 it says, &#8220;They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures. / For with You is the fountain of life&#8221; (vv. 8-9a). Here life is mentioned again; Psalm 36 tells us that in God there is the fountain of life. In other words, God is the source of life. When you dwell in the house of God, the source of life is placed before you, and it is for you to enjoy. What this picture means is that God&#8217;s desire is to work Himself into man to be man&#8217;s life. How can God be wrought into man? It is by the way of eating. It is no wonder that when the Lord Jesus came, He told us in John chapter six that He was the bread of life (v. 35); then He said that those who eat Him shall live because of Him (v. 57b). Not only so, John 1:1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God,&#8221; and then verse 4 says, &#8220;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&#8221; Moreover, John 10:10 says, &#8220;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&#8221; From these verses we can see clearly that the tree of life is God Himself.<p>As Spirit, God is mysterious and invisible to man. Therefore, He used the tree as a symbol, an allegory. When you see this tree, you will wonder, &#8220;To whom does this picture refer?&#8221; This is neither an apple tree nor a peach tree; it is the tree of life. What is life? We know that there is the plant life, there is the animal life, there is the human life, and there is the divine life. Life is always mysterious. Therefore, to make it clear to us, it was not enough for God merely to use words to explain that He is life. Thus, He showed us a picture. When you see this tree, gradually you will realize that you must eat this tree. This means that you need to receive God into you to be your life. Therefore, the tree of life in Genesis 2 expresses the heart&#8217;s desire of God, which is that God wants to enter into man.<p>John 3:16 says that God loves the world. However, our understanding of this word is too shallow. That God loves the people of the world does not mean that He merely likes them; rather, He loves them to the uttermost, to the extent that He wants to enter into them. In the entire universe there are thousands and millions of items created by God, but that which is the most precious to Him is man, because man is His object to be a vessel to contain Him. God desires to be in man. Therefore, at the beginning the Bible expresses the desire of God, and at the end it shows us again the purpose of God. The sixty-six books of the Bible give a record of God&#8217;s works, the ultimate consummation of which is that man can receive God as the tree of life. As the tree of life, God will grow within man to be man&#8217;s life. This is God&#8217;s purpose.<h2 class=head1>II. GOD&#8217;S FULL SALVATION CONSISTING OF TWO GREAT ELEMENTS-REDEMPTION AND SALVATION</h2><p>After God created man, He wanted man to take in the tree of life; that is, He wanted man to receive God Himself into him to be his life supply. However, in the universe besides God there is another one, who in the Bible is called the devil. Before man ate of the tree of life and would thereby receive God, the devil seduced man to eat of another tree and receive him. The devil is symbolized by the other special tree in the Garden of Eden, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When man ate of that other tree, the devil entered into him. Before God could enter into man, the devil entered into him. Once the devil entered into man, the evil nature of the devil was mingled with the nature of man.<p>There are two schools of thought among the Chinese sages. One school says that man is evil by nature, and the other school maintains that man is good by nature. Is man&#8217;s nature good or evil? Both schools have their bases. The man whom God created originally was considered by God as very good because man was created in God&#8217;s image. God is love, God is light, God is holiness, and God is righteousness. Therefore, according to these divine attributes, God created man also to be love, light, holiness, and righteousness. Within us, we prefer light to darkness. Moreover, we have love; we love our parents, we love our relatives, we love our neighbors, we love our schoolmates, and we love others. We are also holy; we do not like to drift with the worldly people. Furthermore, we like to be righteous and just. We all have these characteristics within us. But we have discovered that we also have the evil nature in us. Are we good or evil? According to the Holy Scriptures, we are good with regard to God&#8217;s creation, but with regard to the devil&#8217;s corruption we are evil. Therefore, fallen man is quite complicated. We have the devil and sin within us. The sin within us is also called &#8220;the evil&#8221; (Rom. 7:21). In Romans 7 Paul said that sin dwells in us (vv. 17, 20). Because it can dwell in us, we know that sin is not dead but living. This is what the apostle Paul called &#8220;the evil.&#8221;<p>Not only so, man has transgressions outwardly, so he is a transgressor. Thus, inwardly we are sinners, and outwardly we are transgressors. We are sinners within and transgressors without. As a sinner within, we have greed, lust, and other wickedness. As a transgressor without, we lie, cheat, steal, and do whatever evil things we like to do. The older one becomes, the more shrewd and cunning he becomes. An older person becomes shrewd within and cunning without. When a person gets older, the sin within him also becomes older; hence, he becomes an experienced sinner. When a man gets older, he becomes older in his outward transgressions and thus becomes an experienced transgressor.<h2 class=head2>A. God&#8217;s Redemption, with the Precious Blood of Christ as the Focus, Meeting the Need in the Judicial Aspect</h2><p>Since man became so corrupt, did God then abandon him? No, God so loved man that He would not give him up. Furthermore, God has His eternal purpose. God could not allow Himself to be so easily defeated by Satan. Therefore, He brought in redemption. Redemption was added because man became fallen and was corrupted and thereby became a sinner and a transgressor. In order to use man again as His vessel, God had to thoroughly deal with his situation. God had to rescue man, cleanse man, and make man complete again before He could dwell in him. According to His righteous law, God was obligated to do this. Also according to common logic, God had to do this. God had to first carry out redemption for man before He could use him. Therefore, there are two elements in God&#8217;s full salvation. First, God came to redeem; second, He came to save. Redemption was to meet the need in the judicial aspect. Suppose God ignored the fact that man had been corrupted and still used man for His purpose. Then the angels and the devil would shake their heads and say, &#8220;You are a God of righteousness, light, holiness, and glory. How can You use such a dirty, base, corrupted, evil, and filthy man? This is not right judicially.&#8221; Therefore, God&#8217;s redemption, with the precious blood of Christ as its focus, was necessary in order to meet the need of the judicial aspect (Rom. 3:20-26; Eph. 1:7).<h2 class=head2>B. God&#8217;s Salvation, with the Life of Christ (the Life of God) as the Focus, Meeting the Need for Authority (Power)</h2><p>Although man would want to be God&#8217;s vessel, it is such a pity that in this universe there is an evil power, symbolized by the other tree in the garden. In our surrounding environment, whether in our school, our office, or our society, there is an evil power enticing us not to do good but to do evil. Therefore, although you have made up your mind to do good, it is not up to you when you are surrounded by the power of evil. This is not a matter of redemption but a matter of salvation. In this full salvation God has prepared for us fallen sinners, one of its elements is to redeem us, and the other element is to save us. God&#8217;s salvation is to save us from the evil power that is within us, around us, and above us. Hence, God&#8217;s salvation, with the life of Christ (the divine life) as the focus, is to meet the need for authority, for power (Rom. 5:10).<p>Because of the fall, man now has a sinful nature within him. I have been saved for seventy years, and I have been studying the Bible also for seventy years. In these seventy years I have contacted all kinds of people and have discovered that in man&#8217;s sinful nature there are four &#8220;monsters.&#8221; Every one of us, whether young or old, noble or base, has these four monsters. The first monster is covetousness. When you see someone who has a nice pen on his desk, you begin to think, &#8220;How good it would be if he gave me the pen.&#8221; This is covetousness, out of which comes stealing. The second monster is lust. Look at society today. Children who are still in elementary school begin to be attracted to the opposite sex, and old men with white hair still go to dancing parties; this is lust. The third monster is pride. Everyone seeks vainglory and craves high positions. In a certain university in America, among the top students there was a student in second place who tried to kill the best student. It is a wonder that someone would even try to commit murder in order to become number one. Pride and vainglory are in all of us. In politics, the one who is a bureau director desires to be a department head. After becoming a department head, he wants to be the vice president, and after becoming the vice president, he hopes to be the president. After that I do not know what else he would want to be. Maybe he would like to go to heaven and make himself like God just as the devil desired. Many important persons in the government fight with one another because of their love for vainglory and their struggle for power and position. This is pride.<p>Finally, there is the top monster, and the name of this monster is anger. Do not consider anger to be a small thing. When a person is angry, he easily becomes enraged and gets furious. Then in his fury he will quarrel and fight. I know these things because while preaching the gospel and teaching the truth, I mainly contact and serve people. For example, there was a very good couple both about thirty years old. One day the husband was offended in the office and was still full of anger after he left the office and got into his car. He wanted to find a place to vent his anger and thought that he could do it at home with his wife. By coincidence, on that day the wife was also full of anger at home because the children had been unruly, a neighbor had come to quarrel with her, and a relative had scolded her over the telephone. Thus, when the husband got home, it was a situation of anger versus anger. When these two came face to face, both became inflamed with anger. When anger comes, who can overcome it? When the husband and wife are angry, they become enraged and get into a fury; then they quarrel and fight. Eventually, they either are separated or get a divorce. Therefore, covetousness, lust, pride, and anger are the four monsters within us that cause us to not behave properly as human beings.<p>Every day we are under the manipulation of these four monsters: covetousness, lust, pride, and anger. Every one of us fallen sinners has become unseemly because of these four monsters. There are many things you do in secret that you dare not tell anyone. There are some things you do in secret that you would not tell your parents. There are other things that you would not reveal to your wife or that you would not let your husband know. God created us in His image and according to His likeness, yet we are not like Him. We have become unruly and have gone astray because of the sinful nature that is within us.<h2 class=head2>C. God&#8217;s Redemption Dealing with Man&#8217;s Fall; God&#8217;s Salvation Carrying Out God&#8217;s Intention, Which Is to Give Himself as the Spirit to Be Life to Man</h2><p>Therefore, firstly we need redemption, and secondly we need salvation. God&#8217;s redemption is to deal with man&#8217;s fall, whereas God&#8217;s salvation is to carry out God&#8217;s intention, which is to give Himself as the Spirit to be life to man (2 Cor. 3:6). It is notable that the founders of the religions of the world did not have the term redemption. What they taught is the need to atone for mistakes by meritorious service. Do you think you have merits? Even if you did, what about your former sins? Only the Bible tells us clearly that the Lord Jesus came to accomplish redemption for our sins. He not only redeems us but also saves us by giving Himself as the Spirit to be our life.<h2 class=head2>D. The Redemption through Christ&#8217;s Precious Blood Laying the Foundation and Paving the Way for the Salvation in God&#8217;s Life</h2><p>The redemption through Christ&#8217;s blood lays the foundation and paves the way for salvation in God&#8217;s life (Acts 11:18; Rom. 5:17b-18, 21b). One day, four thousand years after man was created, God was incarnated to become a man, and His name was Jesus. At that time God came and entered into man to be joined with man as one. Thus, He was God, and He was also man. His becoming a man effected His union with the human race. You and I are included in Him. One day He went to the cross and shed His blood to die for us, to bear our sins, and to solve all our problems.<p>The death of Christ on the cross is a mysterious death. Since He was in union with mankind, when He died as a man, we also were brought by Him to the cross to die there. This is a very mysterious teaching in the Bible. The Bible tells us that we are crucified with Christ (Gal. 2:20). He brought us, as mankind, with Him to the cross to be put to death there. Therefore, when He was crucified, we also were crucified in and with Him. Then He was resurrected, and in His resurrection He imparted God to us to be our life. Romans 5:17b shows that the grace and the gift of righteousness, which were brought to us through Christ&#8217;s redemption, can be abundant to such a degree that we are able to reign in the life of God- not only to overcome but even to conquer and reign over all things.<p>In the universe among the human race there is such a history. There was a man who was openly crucified, but three days after He was buried, He was resurrected. When He was resurrected, we also were resurrected with Him. In resurrection He imparted God to us. Therefore, the Bible says that we were crucified with Him, and we were raised up together with Him. To be crucified with Him is for redemption, and to be raised up with Him is for salvation. The salvation of God is carried out by His imparting Himself to us to be in us through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, today we are also the resurrected ones in Him.<p>The Lord is in us, that is, in our spirit. He wants not only to be born in us but also to live and move with us day by day. When we speak, He participates. Whatever we do, He is with us. This is unknown to the unbelievers. The unbelievers think that to believe in Jesus is to believe in a religion and reform one&#8217;s outward behavior. However, the Bible teaches us that God is life, and that apart from Him there is no life. Only His life is the eternal life. This God who is life wants to enter into man to be man&#8217;s life. He created man in order that man might be a vessel to contain Him. Therefore, today anyone who is without God or without Christ is an empty man; he does not have reality. The reality of man is Christ, who is God. God Himself was incarnated to be a man. In this man, He brought the human race to the cross to die there with Him. Then He brought the human race with Him to be resurrected, and in this resurrection He regenerated those whom He had chosen.<h2 class=head2>E. The Four Major Steps of God&#8217;s Salvation in Life-Regeneration, Transformation, Conformation, and Glorification</h2><p>The Christ who died and resurrected was God incarnated to be a man to die for us and to bring us with Him into His resurrection. In resurrection He was transfigured to be the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, God, Christ, and the Spirit are not three separately. God is Christ, and Christ is the Spirit. Today, as the life-giving Spirit, Christ applies God&#8217;s redemption and salvation to us. God&#8217;s salvation in life consists of four major steps: regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification. In this chapter we shall look at the first step of God&#8217;s salvation in life, which is regeneration.<h2 class=head1>III. THE DEFINITION OF REGENERATION-TO BE BEGOTTEN OF GOD AND TO HAVE GOD&#8217;S ETERNAL LIFE IN ADDITION TO MAN&#8217;S NATURAL LIFE</h2><p>Regeneration does not mean that &#8220;all the things of the past died yesterday and all the things henceforth are born today,&#8221; as some may think. Nor is it a so-called daily self-renovation. Regeneration is to be begotten of God (John 1:13) and to have the life of God in addition to the natural life of man (3:16). When God begets us within, His life enters into us. The apostle Paul said, &#8220;It is no longer I who live&#8221; (Gal. 2:20a). Our old &#8220;I&#8221; has been crucified with Christ. We have died. Our baptism shows that we have also been buried. Now it is no longer we who live, but Christ lives in us. Paul also said that Christ, the One who died and rose from the dead, is our life (Col. 3:4a). These are clear words from the Bible, and our Christian life can also testify to these matters. Why do we pray every day? Why do we have morning watch every day? We do these things so that we may draw near to the Lord and come before Him to call on Him. Our calling on Him is our breathing of Him. He as the Spirit is like the air. When we call on Him and pray to Him, we breathe Him in, and He enters into us. We all can testify that if in the morning we do not pray or call on Him, we feel empty and restless throughout the day. When we call on Him, we have the Lord within us.<h2 class=head1>IV. GOD&#8217;S ORDINATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. That Man, Who Was Chosen and Created by God, Should Be Regenerated in Addition to Being Created</h2><p>God in His salvation ordained that man, who was chosen and created by Him, should be regenerated in addition to being created (Gen. 2:9a).<h2 class=head2>B. That Man, Who Was Fallen and Dead in Sins, Should Be Redeemed and Regenerated</h2><p>God also ordained that man, who was fallen and dead in sins, should be redeemed and regenerated (Acts 11:18).<h2 class=head1>V. THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF REGENERATION- THROUGH CHRIST&#8217;S RESURRECTION AND AT THE TIME OF CHRIST&#8217;S RESURRECTION</h2><p>Regeneration was accomplished through Christ&#8217;s resurrection and at the time of Christ&#8217;s resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). Actually, it was not at the time of our believing that we were regenerated. Rather, we were regenerated two thousand years ago when Christ was resurrected. God had already chosen and predestinated us, the believers, before the ages. Before the foundation of the world, when the heavens and the earth were not yet in existence, and before we were born, God chose us. Then God used these thousands of years for us, His chosen ones, to be born into the environment He had appointed. After we were born, God again arranged various circumstances and caused us to experience different situations. God created all kinds of environments in order to save us.<h2 class=head1>VI. THE EXPERIENCE OF REGENERATION- EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES INTO CHRIST EXPERIENCING THE REGENERATION WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH CHRIST&#8217;S RESURRECTION</h2><p>At the time of our repentance and believing, every one of us who believed into Christ (John 3:15) experienced the regeneration (v. 7) accomplished through Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Through this regeneration, God entered into us to be our life. He lives with us and moves with us. When we speak, He speaks with us. He lives in us as our life, and we are His living. He is our content, and we are His expression.<h2 class=head1>VII. THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE REGENERATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. To Be Born of Water-to Be Convicted concerning Sin and to Repent and Confess Our Sins</h2><p>The way the believers experience regeneration has two aspects. The first aspect is to be born of water (John 3:5) by being convicted concerning sin (16:8-11) and by repenting of and confessing our sins (Acts 2:38).<h2 class=head2>B. To Be Born of the Spirit-to Call on and Receive Christ and to Believe into Christ</h2><p>The second aspect of the way the believers experience regeneration is to be born of the Spirit (John 3:5) by calling on and receiving Christ (Rom. 10:13; John 1:12) and by believing into Christ (3:36a). When a person hears the gospel, his conscience is touched and he is convicted. Thus, he repents, confesses his sins, and calls on the Lord Jesus. Once he confesses, prays, and calls on the Lord Jesus, something happens within him. He feels that someone has come into him. Previously he was alone, but now there is another One within him. This One gives him joy and peace. This One does not merely change him but transforms him. I was born into Christianity, grew up in Christianity, and was educated in Christianity. However, I reached the age of nineteen and was still not saved. But one day I heard the gospel, and I could not help but believe. I confessed my sins to the Lord and I prayed. I became different. I used to like certain things, but after I was saved, I did not like them anymore. At that time I was only nineteen years old, but I began to love to read the Bible. I read the Bible constantly from morning until evening. When I was ready to go to sleep, I placed my Bible beside my pillow, and I would still read a couple of verses before turning out the light. Then when I woke up in the morning, I would reach for my Bible to read. Many of us can give the same kind of testimony.<p>First, the Lord Jesus died on the cross for our redemption. Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit. Now He is omnipresent, and He has come to us. Millions of people can testify to this. In 1942 we were having a big gospel campaign in the church during the time of the New Year festival in my hometown Chefoo in the province of Shantung. Someone from Manchuria who was working in the customs office and who made a lot of money came to see me after these meetings. He said to me, &#8220;Mr. Lee, your messages have clearly shown me all the problems within me. I have no questions at all, and I am ready to believe. Please tell me how to believe that I may receive what you have spoken in your messages.&#8221; I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s very simple. When you go home today, try to find a quiet place. Then you pray to the Lord Jesus and confess your sins to Him. According to the feeling in your conscience, confess all your sins, one by one, from your youth until now. At the end you should call on the Lord Jesus.&#8221; When he went home, it was not too late but not that early either. His wife and children were waiting for him. Formerly, he liked to joke with them, but this day when he came home, he was very solemn and did not joke. Therefore, his wife and children took notice of him, and they saw him enter his bedroom and shut the door. The children looked through the window and saw him kneeling down and praying there. The next day when he went back to work at the customs office, he was a completely different person. There are many such stories. Why was he different? He was different because Someone had entered into him.<p>Everyone who is genuinely saved by believing into the Lord Jesus has Someone who entered into him. This One is God, this One is Jesus, and this One is the life-giving Spirit. This is regeneration. When we are regenerated, we are born of God; that is, God is born into us. John 1:12 says, &#8220;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.&#8221; These believers are born of God. We are born once of our parents. However, God&#8217;s original intention was to enter into man. Therefore, He redeemed us by dying on the cross for our sins; then He regenerated us by entering into us through His becoming the life-giving Spirit. Thus, He dwells in us to be our life.<h2 class=head1>VIII. THE ISSUE OF REGENERATION</h2><p>Our being regenerated and having God living in us issue in the following eleven items.<h2 class=head2>A. Becoming Children of God with the Divine Life and the Divine Nature</h2><p>The first issue of regeneration is that we become the children of God with the divine life and the divine nature (John 1:12; 2 Pet. 1:4; cf. Eph. 4:18).<h2 class=head2>B. Being Members of the Household of God, Those Who Are of the Household of the Faith</h2><p>The second issue of regeneration is that we are members of the household of God, those who are of the household of the faith (2:19; Gal. 6:10).<h2 class=head2>C. Being Indwelt by the Triune God- the Father, the Son, and the Spirit</h2><p>The third issue of regeneration is that we are indwelt by the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Eph. 4:6b; Rom. 8:10a; John 14:17). We have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, as the Triune God dwelling in us.<h2 class=head2>D. Becoming the Brothers of Christ and Being Begotten of God the Father with Christ to Become the Many Sons of God</h2><p>The fourth issue of regeneration is that we become the brothers of Christ. We were begotten of God the Father with Christ to become the many sons of God (Rom. 8:29b; Heb. 2:10-12).<h2 class=head2>E. Being the Members of Christ to Be the Increase of Christ</h2><p>The fifth issue of regeneration is that we are the members of Christ to be the increase of Christ (1 Cor. 12:27; John 3:30a). Originally Christ was alone by Himself; then He regenerated us one by one, and we all became His members, His increase. Therefore, John 3 first speaks of regeneration, and then it speaks of us, the regenerated ones, being His increase, which is His counterpart and His bride.<h2 class=head2>F. Constituting the Body of Christ as the Fullness, the Expression, of Christ</h2><p>The sixth issue of regeneration is that as the increase of Christ, we constitute the Body of Christ as the fullness, the expression, of Christ (Rom. 12:5; Eph. 1:23). The Body of Christ is the church, the proper church, not the fallen, degraded church. The proper church is a group of people who believe into Christ, who have Christ living in them as their life, and who live out Christ from within. These are the members of Christ who constitute the Body of Christ, which is the church as the expression of the fullness of Christ.<h2 class=head2>G. Becoming the New Creation</h2><p>The seventh issue of regeneration is that we become the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15). According to what we are by being born of our parents, we are the old creation. But according to our being regenerated by God entering into us, we are the new creation. The old creation is solely man, whereas the new creation is man having God within him.<h2 class=head2>H. Becoming a Part of the New Man</h2><p>The eighth issue of regeneration is that we become a part of the new man (Eph. 2:15; Col. 3:10-11).<h2 class=head2>I. Entering into the Kingdom of God and Becoming Citizens of God</h2><p>The ninth issue of regeneration is that we enter into the kingdom of God and become the citizens of God (John 3:5; Eph. 2:19).<h2 class=head2>J. Being Citizens in the Heavens</h2><p>The tenth issue of regeneration is that we are citizens in the heavens (Phil. 3:20; Eph. 2:6b).<h2 class=head2>K. Being Israel, God&#8217;s Elect</h2><p>The eleventh issue of regeneration is that we are God&#8217;s elect, Israel (Gal. 6:16). We become the real Israel.<p>As Christians, are we men or God? Apparently we are men, but actually we are God as well as men. We are God-men. We can endure with rejoicing, and even with praising, what others cannot endure. We can be holy more than anyone else. In any situation while others drift away with the worldly crowd, we are holy, sanctified. This is not we, but God who lives out of us. As those who have been born of God, we have not only the divine life but also the divine nature. Originally, we did not have the divine nature. In our original, old nature are the four monsters of covetousness, lust, pride, and anger. Now we have the divine nature, which is the nature of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. What we live out are the virtues as manifestations of God&#8217;s attributes. The reason we Christians can surpass others in being loving, holy, just, and upright is not because of anything in ourselves but because God who lives in us lives out His attributes from within us. Once His attributes are lived out from us, the divine attributes become our human virtues. This is to live Christ and to manifest Christ-to take Christ as our life and live Him out as our living. Not only so, this nature of the divine life builds us together to constitute us the Body of Christ, which is His church. This is regeneration, which is the first great step of God&#8217;s salvation in life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SECOND STEP OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION IN LIFE-TRANSFORMATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2a</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The definition of transformation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Not merely a perceptible change outwardly in behavior.</li>	<li>Being a metabolic transformation inwardly in essence.</li>	</ol></li><li>The steps of transformation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Washing-the washing of regeneration-Titus 3:5b.</li>	<li>Sanctification-the sanctification of the Holy Spirit-Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16.</li>	<li>Renewing-the renewing of the Holy Spirit-Titus 3:5b:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Beginning from our mind-Rom. 12:2a.</li>		<li>Through our spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit-Eph. 4:23; Rom. 8:6b.</li>		<li>Reaching all the inward parts of our being.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>A metabolic process-transformation-Rom. 12:2a.</li>	<li>Not accomplished in an instant.</li>	<li>But achieved throughout our entire life-2 Cor. 4:16-17.</li>	</ol></li><li>The way of transformation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>By fellowshipping with the Lord without any barrier-with unveiled face beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glorious image of the Lord-3:18a.</li>	<li>The advancing-from one degree of glory to another degree of glory-v. 18b.</li>	<li>Being transformed into the same image of the Lord, even as from the Lord Spirit-v. 18c.</li>	<li>By remaining in our spirit and exercising our spirit-2 Tim. 4:22; Phil. 4:23; Gal. 6:18.</li>	</ol></li><li>The issue of transformation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Growth and maturity in the divine life-Eph. 4:13b; Col. 1:28.</li>	<li>Arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ-Eph. 4:13c.</li>	</ol></li><li>The purpose of transformation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The building up of the Body of Christ-v. 12.</li>	<li>The accomplishing of God&#8217;s eternal economy-3:9.</li>	</ol></li><li>The ultimate transformation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The transfiguration of our body-Phil. 3:21.</li>	<li>The glorification of our body-Rom. 8:30.</li>	<li>The ultimate redemption-v. 23c; Eph. 1:14; 4:30.</li>	<li>The full taste of the divine sonship-Rom. 8:23b.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>We have seen clearly that the unique heart&#8217;s desire of God in the universe is to work Himself into us to be our life. This is the greatest miracle, and it is also the greatest revelation. But I am afraid that many who have been Christians for a number of years still have not heard about this matter, nor can they speak this word. Therefore, they do not see that at the beginning of the Bible there is a tree, the tree of life. At the conclusion of the Bible, this tree of life appears again. This tree of life expresses God&#8217;s desire, and it also symbolizes God&#8217;s goal.<p>After God created Adam, He waited for two thousand years and still did not come. Then He promised Abraham that Abraham would have a seed and that in this seed all the nations would be blessed. This seed would be God who was to come. At the time of Abraham, although God had created man two thousand years before and the history of the human race also had quite a long record, He still did not come. After another two thousand years John the Baptist appeared. One day he saw Jesus coming to him, and he said, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God&#8221; (John 1:29). This Jesus was God, the Creator of all things, coming among men. At that time the human race already had four thousand years of history. The Lord Jesus came, but He did not come with a great noisy display; rather, He came quietly. He was born in a royal family, being a descendant of King David, but at that time the royal family was in complete ruin. The Lord Jesus lived in a little town of Nazareth in Galilee which was a despised land in Israel. He did not live in the home of a rich man but rather in the home of a carpenter, a laborer who worked hard. Even up to the present day, we do not know all that He did there. The Creator of the heavens and the earth actually lived in that little cottage for thirty-three and a half years and worked as a carpenter.<p>This Jesus was actually God. He was God who became a man, and people called His name Emmanuel (Matt. 1:23). Jesus was God with man. He was not only a royal descendant; He was God. Isaiah prophesied that a Son would be given to us, yet His name would be called Mighty God, Eternal Father (9:6). When He was thirty years old, He began to minister. Then one day after three and a half years He told His disciples that He was going to die on the cross. Apparently, it was men who nailed Him to the cross. Actually, in God&#8217;s view it was He Himself who went to the cross. It was not men who killed Him; rather, it was He Himself who gave up His life to die for us sinners. His death was a vicarious death. He was the One who died to make redemption for all our sins, to solve our problems, and to terminate our old man. On the cross He solved all the problems in the universe between God and man.<p>He was on the cross for six hours, and at the end He declared, &#8220;It is finished!&#8221; (John 19:30). He accomplished the great work of redemption on the cross. Then a rich man took His body, wrapped it in linen cloths with precious spices, and laid it in a new tomb hewn in the rock. After three days the Lord resurrected. He took off the linen cloths in which He was wrapped, folded them neatly, and laid them to one side. Then He walked out of the tomb. At early dawn some of the women who had been following Him came to the tomb and saw that the stone which had been against the door of the tomb was rolled away. Two angels in white sitting there said to them, &#8220;I know that you are seeking Jesus, the crucified. He is not here, for He has been raised, even as He said&#8221; (Matt. 28:5-6; John 20:12).<p>As the only begotten Son of God, the Lord Jesus put on human nature and became a man. Then through His death and resurrection, He brought His humanity into divinity. This means that originally His humanity was not the Son of God, but at this time He brought His humanity into divinity. This human part of Him also became the Son of God. Thus, He became the firstborn Son of God. He was no longer just the only begotten Son but the first among many sons. Firstborn Son indicates that there would be many sons after Him. Therefore, when He resurrected, it was not He alone who resurrected. Rather, He brought a group of people whom God had chosen and predestinated before the ages, before the creation of the heavens, the earth, and all things, to be resurrected together with Him. Before the heavens and the earth were in existence, before we were born, we believers all had been chosen and predestinated by God. We are those chosen by God, and we are those predestinated by God.<p>On the day of His resurrection, the Lord brought us to be resurrected with Him. That resurrection was our regeneration. Originally God created us in His image and according to His likeness. Regrettably, we became fallen. So He was incarnated and then brought us all to the cross to be crucified with Him. This is why Galatians 2:20 says, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ.&#8221; Furthermore, He brought us with Him into resurrection. Thus, 1 Peter 1:3 says, &#8220;God...has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&#8221; We were regenerated before we were born. Not only so, we were all regenerated together. In our view there are the elements of space and time, but in God&#8217;s eternal view there is no element of time. In His eyes a thousand years are like one day. We died together with Christ, and we were also raised up together with Him. Moreover, we were regenerated together with Him.<p>To be regenerated is to receive the life of God in addition to having our natural life. This God who is life entered into us to become our life. On the one hand, it is a blessing to have God as our life; on the other hand, it is a great suffering. The Chinese say that to get married is &#8220;to have a family.&#8221; I say this is right, except that the family becomes a bondage. Once you get married, you are put in shackles. Marriage is a blessing on the one hand and a bondage on the other hand. Similarly, we all have been saved. It is good to be saved, and it is also good to have God as life. When God lives in us, however, He is always bothering us. He &#8220;meddles&#8221; in our trivial affairs, not to mention the big ones. Reading the newspaper is a small matter, yet often within us we sense He will not allow us to read it. Before they were saved, some sisters were very free and at peace when they went shopping on Saturdays. They went whenever they wanted, and they bought whatever they considered inexpensive and suitable. After they were saved, however, the Lord within them would bother them and not want them to go shopping. Sometimes they went anyway and subsequently were not at peace. We often have this kind of experience.<p>This can be compared to two persons who are married and cannot get along with each other. God has come into you to be your life. Now, does He balance you, or do you try to balance Him? Do you go along with Him, or does He go along with you? We all should yield ourselves to the Lord and say, &#8220;Lord, You have chosen me. You arranged all the circumstances for me to be saved. Now You are living in me. Lord, You are the Lord who was God, who became the life-giving Spirit through incarnation, death, and resurrection. You are the Spirit today. I call on Your name. I tell You that I love You and that I want to be transformed.&#8221;<p>The first step of God&#8217;s salvation in life is regeneration. After we are regenerated, we cannot avoid Him; He will always follow us. Apparently He is following us, but actually He wants us to follow Him. The second step of God&#8217;s salvation in life is transformation. After we were saved, we thought that everything would be peaceful and smooth. Little did we know that when we were saved, we were &#8220;caught&#8221; by the Lord. Very often He stirs within us in order to transform us. This transformation is not merely an outward change; it is a metabolic change. At the zoo in Taipei there used to be a show with a monkey eating a Western-style meal. This was a real monkey, but when it came out, it imitated a man. It walked on two legs, sat down, put on a napkin, and began to eat a Western meal with a fork and knife. A man with a whip stood close by to direct the performance. After the performance, however, the monkey jumped about on all four legs, revealing its true nature. Man&#8217;s outward change is just like the monkey&#8217;s eating a Western-style meal. Man is deceitful. He can make many changes on the surface because he is capable of pretending. But the Bible tells us that after we are saved and have God as our life, He then does His transforming work in us with the elements of His divine nature so that we may be like Him.<h2 class=head1>I. THE DEFINITION OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Not Merely a Perceptible Change Outwardly in Behavior</h2><p>Our transformation in the life of God is not merely a perceptible change outwardly in behavior. After a person is saved, he might think that he was a mess as a non-Christian, but now that he is going to church and is also carrying a Bible, he should change his behavior. Many Christians change their behavior this way, and their relatives praise them, saying, &#8220;It is good to be a Christian. See, my child has changed since he believed in Jesus.&#8221; The fact is that inwardly he has not changed; he has changed only outwardly. If after you believe in the Lord Jesus there is a change only in your outward condition, then this change is merely an outward, perceived change in behavior. This is not to be saved in God&#8217;s life. I lived in China when I was young, and I observed many disciples of Confucius. Sometimes their improvement in behavior was quite remarkable. What is the difference between the behavioral improvement of Confucius&#8217; disciples and the transformation of Jesus&#8217; believers? When I was young, I heard some missionaries, who were not clear concerning the truth, say that the teachings of the Bible are exactly the same as the teachings of Confucius. They did not realize that what the teachings of Confucius produced, at most, was an improvement in behavior and not a transformation.<h2 class=head2>B. Being a Metabolic Transformation Inwardly in Essence</h2><p>Transformation is not merely a noticeable change outwardly in behavior; rather, it is a metabolic transformation inwardly in essence. Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &#8220;But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image...even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; In this verse, the word changed is not used. In the New Testament the word transformed is used twice. It occurs once in 2 Corinthians 3:18 and another time in Romans 12:2. This term denotes an inward, metabolic change and not an outward change.<p>What is the difference between change and transformation? We may use the example of a person who has been ill and looks thin and pale. Because of this she puts cosmetics on her face to try to improve her appearance. After applying some powder and lipstick, she has some color and looks nice. This is not transformation but is altogether an outward change. It is just like a Chinese opera singer who may turn his face into a white face, a black face, or a red face. However, whether white, black, or red, it is not transformation; it is a performance. For a person to be transformed means that after he is sick, he nourishes himself properly; then after two months when people see him, they will say that he has good color and looks nice. That kind of healthy look is not something added outwardly. It is a manifestation of an inward physical metabolic transformation in essence.<h2 class=head1>II. THE STEPS OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><p>God wants us to be transformed, but we cannot transform ourselves. There are steps in transformation. If we follow these steps, we will be transformed.<h2 class=head2>A. Washing-the Washing of Regeneration</h2><p>The first step of transformation is that God has washed us, but this washing is not an outward washing by water. This washing is the washing of regeneration referred to in Titus 3:5. When we receive God into us as our life and we are thus regenerated, that is a great washing. At the time of our regeneration, we repented, condemned ourselves, and confessed our sins. Moreover, we confessed that we were sinners who deserve to die and that we were indeed dead and ought to be buried. Therefore, we needed to be baptized in water to declare that we died and have been buried. This is the reason that after we have believed, we must be baptized. To be baptized is to be buried; our old man, our dirty man, our dead man, needs to be buried. This burial is a big washing that buries our old man and our old history in the tomb.<p>We have been saved and also baptized into the Lord. We have been regenerated, and now we have God in us. Our old man was also buried through baptism. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&#8221; (John 3:5). To be born of water is to confess that we are sinners who are condemned, who suffered the penalty of death, and who are buried. Therefore, we now let the baptizing one bury our old man in baptism. Thus, regeneration is a washing. This matter is clearly mentioned in Romans 6.<h2 class=head2>B. Sanctification-the Sanctification of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>The second step of transformation is sanctification, the sanctification of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16). After our old man was buried through baptism, God set us apart and sanctified our regenerated new man. This new man belongs to God, and God is in this new man. This sanctification is not only an objective sanctification in position; it is even more a subjective sanctification in disposition. We, as the saved ones, all have this experience. For example, after a person is saved, without anyone telling him, he may feel that the shoes he is wearing are too worldly. When he bought this pair, he liked the pointed style, which is a favorite of the Texan cowboys. But now that he is saved, when he wears these shoes, he feels that there is too much of a worldly flavor, so he cannot wear them.<p>When I went to the United States about thirty years ago, it was the time of the hippies. There were many hippies who came to our meetings, but there was one that I can never forget. He was big in stature, wore a headdress with varied colors, and had a long beard. He came to the meetings barefoot and sat on the front row. Praise the Lord, after two or three meetings his headdress was gone, and after another week his long beard was also gone. I was very happy. Nevertheless, he still came barefoot. After another week he came wearing sandals. This was better than being barefoot. After another period of time he came wearing shoes, and after a little more time he came also wearing socks. He was sanctified.<p>Stanza 1 of Hymns, #841 says, &#8220;Thou art all my life, Lord, / In me Thou dost live; / With Thee all God&#8217;s fullness / Thou to me dost give. / By Thy holy nature / I am sanctified, / By Thy resurrection, / Vict&#8217;ry is supplied.&#8221; The Lord lives in us to be our life, and this life with the divine nature sanctifies us within. This is the second step of transformation.<h2 class=head2>C. Renewing-the Renewing of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>The third step of transformation is renewing. When we were washed, we were sanctified; when we were sanctified, we were renewed. Titus 3 speaks of the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. I know of some brothers and sisters who have changed their hairstyles. This was not due to the teachings of man, but it was surely the renewing of the Holy Spirit within them.<p>In 1942 during the great revival in Chefoo a young woman came into the church life. She was from a very rich family. She had gone to Shanghai by herself to study law in the university so that she might come back to fight for her inheritance. We all knew her family situation. I saw her sitting in the meeting and noticed that her hair was like a tower three or four stories high. After she came to the meetings for about one or two weeks, I saw that the high tower on her head was dismantled, though not completely, because there was still a little portion left. Then after another period of time, the tower was completely brought down. We can say that the change in her hairstyle was a renewing. From the time we are saved, we who love the Lord may feel that we are often weak, and we fail in many things. Yet if we carefully consider even a little, we will realize that in many areas we have been renewed.<h2 class=head3>1. Beginning from Our Mind</h2><p>Renewing begins from our mind. Romans 12:2 says, &#8220;Be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&#8221; God is in us as our life to transform us. How does He begin the transformation? First, God comes to be our life. Many verses in the Bible refer to this matter. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit.&#8221; This shows us that the Lord is in our spirit. Then it says, &#8220;Grace be with you.&#8221; The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as our enjoyment. This is in our spirit. However, our spirit is the deepest part of our being, and it is surrounded by our mind, emotion, and will. Therefore, the Lord wants us who love Him to have our spirit spread into our soul that we may always set our mind on our spirit.<p>We all know that man has three parts. The outermost part is the body, the innermost is the spirit, and in the middle is the soul. Thus, starting from the outside, we have the body, the soul, and the spirit; whereas, starting from the inside, we have the spirit, the soul, and the body. When we were saved, we first felt regretful and confessed our sins. That feeling of regret was the function of our conscience, which is the main part of our spirit. Then we repented and called on the name of the Lord. Although we called outwardly, we were motivated from the spirit deep within us. Thus, we believed in the Lord and received Him. He then began to renew us in our mind. The renewing of the mind is the foundation of the transformation of our soul, and it is the result of our setting our mind on the spirit (Rom. 8:6). Our mind is the main part of our soul. Since our emotion and our will, together with our mind, constitute our soul, when our mind is renewed, our emotion and will spontaneously will be renewed along with the mind.<h2 class=head3>2. Through Our Spirit, Which Is Mingled with the Spirit, Reaching All the Inward Parts of Our Being</h2><p>Renewing is also through our spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit (Eph. 4:23, Rom. 8:6b). This renewing reaches all the inward parts of our being. God, who is Spirit, cannot dwell firstly in our body or in our soul; He has to take our spirit as His dwelling place. John 4:24 says, &#8220;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&#8221; Also, John 3:6 says, &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; God is Spirit, and we are born of Him in our spirit. Therefore, our inner spirit and He as the Spirit have become one spirit. After we are saved, however, God wants all the parts of our soul to be transformed. First this is the transformation of the mind; then it is the transformation of the will and the emotion.<p>Our mind may have two kinds of action. One results in our being in the spirit; the other, in the flesh. If our mind is dependent upon and joined to our regenerated spirit, which has been mingled with the Spirit of God, this will bring us into the mingled spirit for the renewing of our mind, and this renewing will reach all the inward parts of our being. If our mind is joined to our flesh and acts independently of the mingled spirit, this will bring us into the flesh and make us enemies of God, being unable to please God. Thus, we will not be renewed and transformed.<p>We as saved persons have many situations in which to set our mind on the spirit or on the flesh. If we set our mind on the flesh, then we cannot be transformed. Instead, we will become worse than what we were. We who are saved have God in our spirit, and yet at times we do not follow God in our spirit but rather follow our flesh. Romans 8:6a says that the mind set on the flesh is death. Thus, we will be deadened, depressed, dried up, darkened, and without peace. This is the result of setting our mind on the flesh.<p>Our spirit is a spirit mingled with God&#8217;s Spirit; it is two spirits mingled to be one spirit. This mingled spirit is our spirit and also God&#8217;s Spirit; it is God&#8217;s Spirit and also our spirit. When we set our mind on this mingled spirit, immediately we are joyful, uplifted, and released; we also feel satisfied, watered, and enlightened. We have the sense of life and peace. Romans 8:6b says, &#8220;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&#8221; If we continually set our mind on the spirit and cooperate with the spirit, then this mingled spirit will be united with our mind, and within us there will be transformation continually. Then the concepts of our mind concerning many matters will be different. Our logic will be changed. We will be transformed and renewed, reaching every inward part of our entire being.<p>Now our spirit will spread from our innermost part to the mind in our soul, and the mind will surrender to our spirit and cooperate with our spirit. As a result, this spirit will be able to penetrate our will and our emotion. Then we will discover that our own love toward others is not the love of God, and our likes and dislikes toward people, things, or matters are different from God&#8217;s likes and dislikes. Previously we thought that we were quite all right, but now we see that our love is just our own love and not God&#8217;s love. Our emotion has been changed. We no longer merely love whatever we like and hate whatever we dislike; we are no longer this way. Our emotion is now under God&#8217;s control and is being transformed.<p>Before you were saved, you might have been a person of a strong will. When you decided on something, no one could change your mind. Now it is no longer so. Now you see that your intention is altogether your own; it is not God&#8217;s intention. You then allow the spirit within you to direct your intention. When God does not make the decision, you also would not decide. As a result, whatever you decide will be the decision of God. God&#8217;s will and your will become one will. In this way your soul is being transformed, part by part. Your mind is being transformed, your emotion is being transformed, and your will also is being transformed.<p>This work of transformation carried out by God in us is very deep, and it is also very fine. The Lord is so fine and detailed that He interferes even in the matter of how long or how short our hair should be. If we cooperate with the mingled spirit within, then we will be living with God and in God&#8217;s life, allowing God&#8217;s life to strengthen us into our inner spirit continually. Then our spirit will come forth to conquer our mind, subdue our will, and transform our emotion. Thus, we will be in newness. We then will see things as God sees them. Our view will be God&#8217;s view. Our loving and hating of any matter will be the same as God&#8217;s. All our decisions will be the same as His.<p>Christians often say, &#8220;Let us pray and see what the Lord&#8217;s will is.&#8221; This is a common saying, yet most Christians actually do not know what this means. To see what the mind of the Lord is requires us to return to our spirit and follow the Spirit who is life within us. Then from this Spirit we will have a view that knows how to discern matters. We will see whether or not we should love a certain thing and how we should decide on a certain matter. At that time, if we make a decision, it will surely be from God. We must follow the direction of the Spirit within us, letting our mind be set on the spirit, letting our will follow the spirit, and also letting our emotion obey the spirit.<h2 class=head2>D. A Metabolic Process-Transformation</h2><p>The fourth step of transformation is a metabolic process (Rom. 12:2a). What the human body needs most is the circulation of the blood. But in the blood circulation, new elements and good elements must be added into the blood; otherwise, the blood circulation will be useless. When the Chinese speak of taking care of the body, they mean eating better so that the blood may gain the nutrients. Thus, the blood brings the new nutrients to the different parts of the body, and at the same time, it discharges the old elements from the body. This is metabolism.<p>The Lord&#8217;s transformation in us is a metabolism. If we were to change ourselves, we would not have the new elements, and our change would be only an outward cosmetic change. But the transformation which the Lord is carrying out in us is with the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit. When we fellowship with the Lord, He supplies us within. This supply is a supply of new elements. The spiritual blood circulation also discharges the old things from us. This is a metabolic transformation.<h2 class=head2>E. Not Accomplished in an Instant</h2><p>The transformation within us by the Holy Spirit cannot be accomplished in an instant. The metabolic transformation cannot be carried out in a hurry; rather, it is like taking Chinese medicine where the effect is gradual.<h2 class=head2>F. But Achieved Throughout Our Entire Life</h2><p>The transformation within us by the Holy Spirit is achieved throughout our entire life (2 Cor. 4:16-17). When we contact the Lord daily, we receive the nutrients freshly supplied by His resurrection life. Thus, we will be renewed and transformed in a continuing way.<h2 class=head1>III. THE WAY OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. By Fellowshipping with the Lord without Any Barrier- with Unveiled Face Beholding and Reflecting Like a Mirror the Glorious Image of the Lord</h2><p>The way to be transformed is first by fellowshipping with the Lord without any barrier, that is, with an unveiled face beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glorious image of the Lord (3:18a). Stanza 5 of Hymns, #501 reads, &#8220;In spirit while gazing on Thee, / As a glass reflecting Thy glory, / Like to Thyself transformed I&#8217;ll be, / That Thou might be expressed thru me.&#8221; We must be this way every day. There is a distinct difference between one who reads the Word for ten minutes and prays for five minutes in the morning and one who neither reads the Word nor prays. Every morning we must have fellowship with the Lord in this way, even if we are very busy. Moreover, during the day we also must find time to draw near to Him, to be face to face with Him. Then we will be like a mirror beholding Him and reflecting His glory. Thus, the Lord will transfuse into us the elements of what He is and what He has done. By the power of His life and with His life elements we shall gradually be metabolically transformed to have His life shape. What is most important is that through the renewing of our mind we shall gradually be transformed into His image.<h2 class=head2>B. The Advancing-from One Degree of Glory to Another Degree of Glory</h2><p>Second, the way of transformation is by an increase and an advance, that is, advancing from one degree of glory to another degree of glory (v. 18b). In the pathway of transformation, we proceed from one level of glory to another level of glory, from glory to glory, progressively.<h2 class=head2>C. Being Transformed into the Same Image of the Lord, Even as from the Lord Spirit</h2><p>Third, the way of transformation is to be transformed by the Spirit of the Lord into the same image as the Lord (v. 18c). Today the Spirit of the Lord is no longer only the Spirit of God as in Genesis 1:2. At that time the Spirit of God was purely the Spirit of God. At that time He had only one element in Him, the divine element, the element of God. There was no other element besides the divine element. However, since that time the Spirit of God has passed through various processes with the Lord Jesus and has been consummated. In John 7:37-39 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet.&#8221; The Spirit of God was there, but the processed and consummated Spirit was not yet. It was not until the Lord Jesus was resurrected and glorified that He became a life-giving Spirit. At that time the Spirit of God also became the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This Spirit of Jesus Christ has the divine element, the human element, the elements of Christ&#8217;s death and its efficacy, and the elements of Christ&#8217;s resurrection and its power. Today these elements are in the processed, all-inclusive, and consummated Spirit of Jesus Christ.<p>The holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30 is a type of this all-inclusive compound Spirit. Ointment is different from oil. Oil is purely oil, and it has no other ingredient in it. But when oil is compounded with other ingredients, it becomes an ointment. The holy ointment in Exodus 30 was firstly olive oil. Second, it contained four ingredients: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. These four kinds of ingredients were ground into powder and mingled with the oil to become an ointment. This was the holy anointing ointment. With this holy anointing ointment Moses anointed the tabernacle, the altar, all the furniture and utensils in the tabernacle, and the serving ones. All learned Bible readers admit that this holy anointing ointment typifies the Holy Spirit. Olive oil signifies the Holy Spirit, myrrh signifies the death of Christ, cinnamon signifies the effectiveness of Christ&#8217;s death, calamus signifies Christ&#8217;s resurrection, and cassia signifies the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. These are all compounded in the processed and consummated Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit of God became the compound Spirit with these elements.<p>Today this Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and, even more, the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Therefore, Philippians chapter one speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Since the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the compounded, all-inclusive Spirit, His supply is bountiful. Do you need divinity? He has it. Do you need humanity? He has it. Do you need the Lord&#8217;s death? He has it. Do you need the effectiveness of the Lord&#8217;s death? He has it. Do you need the Lord&#8217;s resurrection? He has it. Do you need the power of resurrection? He has it also. When you have this Spirit, you have everything. Therefore, our being transformed into the same image as the Lord, which is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:18, is from this Spirit, the Lord Spirit.<h2 class=head2>D. By Remaining in Our Spirit and Exercising Our Spirit</h2><p>The fourth way of transformation is by remaining in our spirit and exercising our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Phil. 4:23; Gal. 6:18). Today this processed, all-inclusive, and compound Spirit is in our spirit, and He is working in our spirit. Hence, 1 John 2:27 says, &#8220;The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things.&#8221; This anointing is the moving of the all-inclusive, compound Spirit in us. We must mingle ourselves with this Spirit daily, morning and evening, even moment by moment. It is best to remain in our spirit indwelt by this Spirit. When we remain in our spirit, the compound Spirit, who is the Spirit of Jesus Christ today and who is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, will work within us. His working supplies us, and from this supply we receive new elements. This is metabolism. Listening to messages and understanding the meaning of transformation will not cause us to be transformed. This series of four messages has only explanations and instructions; we still have to practice according to what is said in them.<p>Daily we must practice to remain in our spirit and be joined as one with the Lord as the compound Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, and the dispensing Spirit. He supplies us within continually, dispensing the riches of Christ and the fullness of God into our whole being. This becomes the supply to our whole being, and within us we then have new elements to replace the old elements. This is the work of spiritual metabolism. Thus, we will be healthy spiritually, and we will be transformed. This is not to improve ourselves. Rather, it is the all-inclusive, compound Spirit transforming us with the elements of God.<p>In summary, we should not depart from the Spirit who is in our spirit. When we remain in the Spirit, gradually we will be transformed. The Spirit does not simply improve us; instead, He transforms us, who are not God, into God-men and unites us with God as one. Strictly speaking, this God is Jesus Christ today. This is to live Christ and to live out Christ. This is to express Christ and to manifest Christ. To sum it up this is a corporate expression, which is the Body of Christ as His fullness and His expression.<h2 class=head1>IV. THE ISSUE OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Growth and Maturity in the Divine Life</h2><p>The first issue of our transformation is our growth and maturity in the divine life (Eph. 4:13b; Col. 1:28). When we are transformed, we obtain Christ as the element of the divine life and grow and mature in the divine life.<h2 class=head2>B. Arriving at the Measure of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ</h2><p>The second issue of our transformation is that we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13c). Christ as a person has a fullness, and His fullness is His Body. If I had only a head but not a body, then my head would be suspended in the air. Not only would there be no fullness, but also I would be terrifying to look at. Today I have a body, and this body is my fullness. The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ, which has a stature with a measure. When we have been transformed, we will have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.<h2 class=head1>V. THE PURPOSE OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><p>The purpose of transformation is the building up of the Body of Christ (v. 12) and the accomplishing of God&#8217;s eternal economy (3:9).<h2 class=head1>VI. THE ULTIMATE TRANSFORMATION</h2><p>The ultimate transformation is the transfiguration of our body (Phil. 3:21). Today our body is a body of humiliation. At the coming of the Lord, He will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself. This is the glorification of our body (Rom. 8:30), and this is also God&#8217;s ultimate redemption (v. 23c; Eph. 1:14; 4:30). At this stage we will have reached the highest point-a completely redeemed person. Not only will our spirit be regenerated and our soul be transformed, but our body also will be redeemed and transfigured. This is the full taste of the divine sonship (Rom. 8:23b). God has entered into us and has regenerated us to make us His sons. As sons, we have the sonship, the blessing of the sons. The ultimate blessing of the divine sonship that we receive from God is the transfiguration of our mortal body, a body of sin and of death, into a body of resurrection and glory. This is the highest blessing and the blessing of full enjoyment. All this is produced through transformation. May the Lord have mercy on us that daily we may be transformed in God&#8217;s salvation in life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE THIRD STEP OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION IN LIFE-CONFORMATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:29; Phil. 3:10; 1 John 3:2</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The definition of conformation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Conformation being the effect of transformation in life-2 Cor. 3:18.</li>	<li>With the firstborn Son of God, the God-man who joins God to man, as the mold-Rom. 8:29.</li>	</ol></li><li>The purpose of God&#8217;s salvation in life:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To conform the believers to the image of the firstborn Son of God-Rom. 8:29.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God being to be conformed to the image of the God-man, who is the union of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>To be conformed to the glorious image of God as the Word who became flesh.</li>			<li>To be conformed to the lowly image of the man in whom God is embodied-Phil. 2:7-8.</li>			<li>To live the life of the God-man in which the divine attributes are expressed in human virtues.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>To live a life of denying our natural life under the crucifixion of Christ by being conformed to His death-Phil. 3:10c.</li>		<li>To live out the reality of the spiritual life of God by the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection-Phil. 3:10a.</li>		<li>To take the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, as our life and person-1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2; Gal. 5:16, 25.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>To be led into glorification in the divine glory by arriving at maturity of life through transformation in life-Eph. 4:13b; Col. 1:28; Rom. 8:30; Heb. 2:10a.</li>	</ol></li><li>The consummation of God&#8217;s salvation in life:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The believers being absolutely like God in God&#8217;s righteousness and holiness in the consummation of their maturity in life-1 John 3:2; Eph. 4:24.</li>	<li>The New Jerusalem, in which the believers consummate, and God, who sits on the throne in eternity, appearing in the divine glory in full resemblance to one another, both being like jasper-Rev. 4:3a; 21:11, 18a, 19b.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>In order to be our life God was incarnated to accomplish redemption for us. He died and resurrected, and in resurrection He was transfigured to become a life-giving Spirit that He might enter into us. In this way He regenerated us, and we received Him as our life within. After this what we need to do is to allow this life to transform us from within. This transformation is entirely a matter of spiritual metabolism. We thank the Lord that we are all in this process of transformation. However, this transformation has a goal. What is this goal? It is to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. In this chapter we want to consider the matter of conformation.<h2 class=head1>I. THE DEFINITION OF CONFORMATION-CONFORMATION BEING THE EFFECT OF TRANSFORMATION IN LIFE, WITH THE FIRSTBORN SON OF GOD, THE GOD-MAN WHO JOINS GOD TO MAN, AS THE MOLD</h2><p>Conformation is the effect of transformation in life (2 Cor. 3:18), with the firstborn Son of God, the God-man who joins God to man, as the mold (Rom. 8:29). Conformation is the end result of transformation. It includes the changing of our inward essence and nature, and it also includes the changing of our outward form, that we may have the same image of Christ, the God-man, in glory.<p>God&#8217;s firstborn Son, the God-man who joins God to man, is the mold to which we are being conformed. We are His mass production. Both the inward and the outward changes in us, the product, are the results of the operation of the law of the Spirit of life (v. 2) in our being.<h2 class=head1>II. THE PURPOSE OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION IN LIFE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. To Conform the Believers to the Image of the Firstborn Son of God</h2><p>The goal of God&#8217;s salvation in life is to conform the believers to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29).<h2 class=head3>1. To Be Conformed to the Image of the Firstborn Son of God Being to Be Conformed to the Image of the God-man, Who Is the Union of the Processed Triune God with the Transformed Tripartite Man</h2><p>To be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God is to be conformed to the image of the God-man, who is the union of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man. As the only begotten Son of God before His incarnation, Christ had divinity but not humanity. He was self-existing and ever-existing, as God was. His being the firstborn Son of God, having both divinity and humanity, began with His resurrection.<p>This God-man is a joining of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man. He is both God and man. Now God has been processed, and man has been transformed. By joining these two together, Christ becomes the God-man to whose image we are being conformed. When we are conformed to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son, we are conformed, on the one hand, to the glorious image of God as the Word who became flesh, and on the other hand, to the lowly image of the man in whom God was embodied (Phil. 2:7-8). Thus, we live the God-man life, a life in which the divine attributes are expressed in human virtues.<p>From the beginning Christ existed in the form of God, having the essence and nature of God&#8217;s glorious being. When He became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in the lowly image of a man who embodied God. On the one hand, as God He was glorious; on the other hand, as a man He was lowly. Christ joined these two aspects together. When He was on this earth, sometimes He was glorious; that was His being God. Other times when He spoke, people might not have seen much glory there, but the words they heard Him speak were truly glorious. If we read Matthew chapters five through seven or John chapters fourteen through seventeen, we can sense that this Man, the Lord Jesus, is so great. His wisdom and His utterances are indescribable. We can only say, &#8220;Glorious! Glorious! Truly glorious!&#8221; He spoke as a man, yet what was expressed in His words was glory. Was Jesus the Nazarene speaking there? Yes, He was the lowly Jesus of Nazareth, yet His words, which were the words of God, were full of glory. His words were great, high, and glorious, yet they were uttered by a humble, lowly, and small Jesus. How marvelous this is!<p>Such is the image to which we are being conformed. In this image there is man, and there is also God; there is glory, and there is also lowliness. By ourselves we cannot make it. We need this wonderful One to save us by being our life. He can conform us to such an image that we may live such a God-man life, a life in which the divine attributes are expressed in human virtues.<p>Let me say a little more here. When I was young, I observed that in July the northern Chinese would make a kind of dessert called &#8220;ch&#8217;iao-kuo.&#8221; They used a board which had seven designs carved out on it in the shapes of a fish, a chicken, a bird, a tiger, a lion, a leopard, and a child respectively. These seven carvings were seven molds with which this dessert was made. People kneaded the dough and filled each mold with dough. After being baked, when the molds were emptied, the dough came out in the shapes of a small fish, a small chicken, a small bird, a small tiger, a small lion, a small leopard, and a small child. This is conformation. The original dough was just a lump without a nose or eyes; it had no definite shape. Then after it had passed through molding and baking, it was no longer only a lump of dough; it became seven pieces of dough baked in different shapes. After this process, they became delicious desserts. But this kind of mold is only an outward mold.<p>Fruit trees produce fruit, such as apples, peaches, apricots, bananas, and papayas. These different fruit trees do not need the gardener to provide molds for them to produce different kinds of fruit. Apple trees produce fruit in the shape of apples, and for thousands of years the shape of apples has remained unchanged. Likewise, peach trees produce peaches. Fruit trees do not need our worrying, nor do they need our instructions, nor do they need molds. The shape of the fruit is in the life element of the tree. The life element of the peach tree is peach; as a result, the peach tree spontaneously bears peaches.<p>Consider the matter of human conception. When a fetus is conceived in the mother&#8217;s womb, it does not have a mold. Yet when it grows in the womb, it develops ears, eyes, nose, and other parts of the body until it grows into a boy or a girl. Although there is no outward mold, it grows into a proper shape. The shapes of the living things are not determined by any outward mold but are derived from their genes. What are the genes? We may say that the genes are the inward &#8220;mold&#8221; of life which God gave us in His marvelous creation. This mold of life is not outward and does not come by imitation. Rather, it is contained in the life element. Different fruit trees bear different fruit according to their intrinsic life element.<p>Today we who believe in Christ have both the human life and the divine life; the divine life can transform our human life. This may be compared to a caterpillar being transformed into a butterfly. The caterpillar grows and grows until finally it becomes a butterfly, and what is left of the original caterpillar is just an empty cocoon. We are sinners within and transgressors without; that is, we are just like caterpillars. However, after a period of time we will be transformed into butterflies. Today we are all like caterpillars, but we all have the life of God within us. Since the day God entered into us, He has been transforming us daily. God&#8217;s work of transformation within us is very deep and very fine. Hence, it cannot be as fast as the transforming of a caterpillar into a butterfly.<p>This One who is transforming us from within is not only God but the God-man. This God-man is God Himself who was incarnated, died on the cross, terminated the old creation, and entered into resurrection. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. This was God passing through various processes. If He did not pass through all these processes, He would not be able to come into us. Now He has passed through all these processes. Therefore, like the air, it is easy for Him to enter into us. After He comes into us, He does the work of transformation in us. He is not adjusting us. Often we have the old concept of morality and think that the Holy Spirit in us is adjusting us. If we have a bad temper, we will think that we need the Holy Spirit to adjust us so that we would not have a bad temper. This is our concept. Although this concept is not heretical, it is a wrong teaching. This is the influence of the teachings of Confucius. This is the concept of the Chinese philosophers and Confucius&#8217; disciples, but this is not what the Bible teaches. The Bible tells us that men became sinners and transgressors due to the fall. One day God, who is holiness, righteousness, love, and light, passed through the processes of incarnation, death, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. Thus, He was able to come into us. When He came in, He brought with Him some factors and elements with which to transform us in our inward being day by day. Therefore, the apostle Paul said in Philippians 1:19, &#8220;This will turn out to salvation through...the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&#8221;<p>The Lord Jesus is the Triune God who was incarnated to put on human nature. Originally He was merely God, but now by putting on human nature through His incarnation, He has become a God-man. In His wisdom and by His sovereignty God planned and prepared the cross, and on this cross Jesus, the God-man, was crucified. As God, He is without sin and is also holy, and through His death on the cross He released His life. But He is also a man, and through His death on the cross all the negative things in the universe that were hanging on Him, such as sins, trespasses, Satan, the flesh, passions, lusts, and the world, were crucified with Him. Then Christ came out of death and entered into resurrection. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. The Triune God passed through these processes, and now in this life-giving Spirit there is God, there is man, there is the all-inclusive death, and there is the effectiveness of death. In this death sin was dealt with, the world and Satan were judged, the flesh and lusts were eliminated. Furthermore, in this Spirit there is the power of resurrection that releases the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life.<p>This Spirit is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. We may use this example: I like to drink lemon juice with some honey and a little salt. First I have a glass of plain water, then I add lemon, and then I add some honey and a small amount of salt. Eventually, in this glass there are water, lemon, honey, and salt. When I drink this glass of liquid, I get the water, the lemon, the honey, and the salt. Originally the Spirit of God was like the plain water. When God was incarnated, humanity was added to divinity. Then He was crucified, and by this the death on the cross was also added to the Spirit of God; the effectiveness of death was also included in this Spirit. He then entered into resurrection, so the power of resurrection was also in this Spirit. Now the Spirit who regenerates us is this Spirit. When He regenerates us, He comes to live in us. This all-inclusive Spirit contains the processed Triune God with His complete and full divinity and His perfect humanity. In addition, this Spirit has His death with its effectiveness and His resurrection with its power. This all-inclusive Spirit is Christ, and Christ is God. God was incarnated to be Christ, Christ was transfigured to become the Spirit, and the Spirit comes into us with all these elements.<p>Whenever we rise up in the morning and fellowship with the Lord who is in us, calling on His name, He, as the Spirit of reality, supplies us within. God is Christ, the Lord, the Spirit, and He is in us. When we receive His supply, we are satisfied and uplifted. We will sense an operation within us that is killing the negative things within us, such as our bad temper and our quick disposition, and it is also supplying us with the abundant life. This is metabolic transformation. The result of such a transformation is that we are conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus was both God and man, and He passed through death and resurrection. Likewise, we also are both God and man, and we also passed through death and resurrection. We are those who are the union of the Triune God and the tripartite man; we died and now are living.<p>We are being conformed to the image of the God-man, the firstborn Son of God. He is the firstborn Son, and we are the many sons. Thus, we enjoy all the riches of God.<h2 class=head3>2. To Live a Life of Denying Our Natural Life under the Crucifixion of Christ by Being Conformed to His Death</h2><p>Furthermore, to be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God is to live a life of denying our natural life under the crucifixion of Christ by being conformed to His death (Phil. 3:10c). To be conformed to the image of Christ, we need to be conformed first to His death. If we are not the same as He is in His death, then we will not be like Him. Therefore, Philippians 3:10 says that we must be in the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death. He suffers, and we suffer with Him; this is the fellowship of His sufferings. In this way we are conformed to the mold of His death. The mold of Christ&#8217;s death is to live a life of denying our natural life under the crucifixion of Christ. In our daily life we should not do anything by our natural life. Rather, in everything we must deny our natural life. This is to apply death to ourselves. We have a mold in us, and that mold is death, the denying of our natural life.<p>In the image of the firstborn Son of God there is the element of death, that is, the denying of His own life. While He was living on the earth, He denied His own life every moment and lived by the Father&#8217;s life instead. Although His crucifixion was the final stop of His journey on earth, throughout the thirty-three and a half years of His life He lived under the death of the cross by denying Himself and living by the Father&#8217;s life. This also is a great element in the all-inclusive Spirit. In the matter of love we have to ask, &#8220;Lord, is it I who love, or is it You who loves in me, from me, and through me?&#8221; If we love by ourselves, that is a love by our natural life and is without death or resurrection. If we deny our natural life and live by Christ, then we are according to the apostle Paul&#8217;s word: &#8220;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). This is to be conformed to the death of Christ.<h2 class=head3>3. To Live Out the Reality of the Spiritual Life of God by the Power of Christ&#8217;s Resurrection</h2><p>To be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God is to live out the reality of the spiritual life of God by the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection (Phil. 3:10a). The power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection is the life that raised Him from the dead. In order to know and experience this power of Christ we need to be joined and conformed to the death of Christ. We need to live a life of crucifixion as He did. Our being conformed to His death allows His resurrection power to rise up so that His divine, spiritual life may be practically expressed through us.<h2 class=head3>4. To Take the Life-giving Spirit, the Pneumatic Christ, as Our Life and Person</h2><p>To be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God is to take the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, as our life and person (1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2; Gal. 5:16, 25).<h2 class=head2>B. To Be Led into Glorification in the Divine Glory by Arriving at Maturity of Life through Transformation in Life</h2><p>The goal of God&#8217;s salvation in life is also that we be led into glorification in the divine glory by arriving at maturity of life through transformation in life (Eph. 4:13b; Col. 1:28; Rom. 8:30; Heb. 2:10a). Glorification is a matter that we need to be led into. According to 2 Corinthians 3:18, our transformation is from glory to glory. Transformation is a pathway of glory, and it increases from one degree of glory to another degree of glory. When we have passed through this kind of transformation, the result is our conformation, which is very close to glorification and leads us into glorification.<h2 class=head1>III. THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION IN LIFE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Believers Being Absolutely Like God in God&#8217;s Righteousness and Holiness in the Consummation of Their Maturity in Life</h2><p>The consummation of God&#8217;s salvation in life is the believers&#8217; absolute resemblance to God in His righteousness and holiness in the consummation of their maturity in life (1 John 3:2; Eph. 4:24). Ephesians 4:24 says, &#8220;And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&#8221; Our putting on the new man is not instantaneous; it is a gradual putting on. We must put off the old man and put on the new man. Our putting off the old man is also gradual. Do not think that our old temper and old habits can be completely put off at once. The Holy Spirit in us is very patient. We put on the new man in the renewed and transformed spirit of our mind. This new man is created according to the image of God, and the image of God denotes God&#8217;s righteousness and God&#8217;s holiness. The more we put off the old man and put on the new man, the more we will be like God in His righteousness and holiness. Previously we could buy certain things, but now we cannot. We can no longer go to the places we went to before. We find that some styles of clothing we wore before are not suitable for us to wear now. Some of the paintings and decorations which we used to have at home, we can no longer hang up or display. This is to express God&#8217;s righteousness and holiness in the reality of our living. The more we put on the new man, the more we will manifest the image of God&#8217;s righteousness and holiness in our living.<h2 class=head2>B. The New Jerusalem, in Which the Believers Consummate, and God, Who Sits on the Throne in Eternity, Appearing in the Divine Glory in Full Resemblance to One Another, Both Being like Jasper</h2><p>The ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s salvation in life is that the New Jerusalem, in which the believers consummate, and God, who sits on the throne in eternity, will appear in the divine glory in full resemblance to one another, both being like jasper (Rev. 4:3a; 21:11, 18a, 19b).<p>The New Jerusalem is the consummation of us, the redeemed believers. The entire wall of the New Jerusalem is jasper. This is the image of the wall. Revelation 4:3 shows us that the God who sits on the throne is like a jasper stone in appearance. Therefore, both the New Jerusalem and the God who sits on the throne are the same in appearance. This is our consummate conformation as the corporate New Jerusalem. This New Jerusalem is exactly the same as the God who sits on the throne. God, who sits on the throne, is jasper, and we also are jasper. The color of jasper is green, and it is bright. This symbolizes that we are bright in life just like God. In our actions and in our living we are righteous and holy like God. In essence we are jasper, which is full of the life that is so bright, just like God. This is the consummate conformation.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE FOURTH STEP OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION IN LIFE-GLORIFICATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 2:10a; 1 Pet. 5:10a; 2 Cor. 3:18b; Rom. 8:30</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The definition of glorification:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Objectively, glorification is that the redeemed believers will be brought into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God-Heb. 2:10a; 1 Pet. 5:10a.</li>	<li>Subjectively, glorification is that the matured believers will manifest from within them, by their maturity in life, the glory of God as the element of their maturity in life-Rom. 8:17-18, 21; 2 Cor. 4:17.</li>	<li>Regeneration is accomplished in our spirit, transformation is through our soul, and glorification is consummated in our body-John 3:6b, Rom. 12:2b; 8:23, 30.</li>	</ol></li><li>The real significance of the glory of God:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The glory of God is God Himself-Jer. 2:11.</li>	<li>The manifestation of God is the glory of God-Acts 7:2.</li>	</ol></li><li>The reality of the believers&#8217; glorification:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The believers&#8217; glorification is their gaining of God Himself.</li>	<li>The believers&#8217; entering into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God is their entering into God Himself to enjoy God Himself.</li>	<li>The believers&#8217; being transformed in the divine life today is God&#8217;s being expressed in the believers as glory; hence, this daily transformation is from glory to glory-2 Cor. 3:18b.</li>	<li>The consummation of glory into which the believers will enter by their transformation in life is that the believers will be glorified-their body will be redeemed, and they will thereby enter into the glory of God to fully enjoy God as glory-Rom. 8:21, 23, 30.</li>	</ol></li><li>Glorification being the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s salvation in life:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The believers&#8217; arriving at glorification is the climax of their maturity in the life of God.</li>	<li>The believers&#8217; reaching the peak of glorification is their reaching the climax of God&#8217;s salvation in life.</li>	</ol></li><li>The believers&#8217; glorification being the accomplishment of God&#8217;s economy for the satisfaction of God&#8217;s desire:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The full expression of the believers&#8217; glorification is the New Jerusalem, which will be manifested in glory-Rev. 21:10-11.</li>	<li>This is the full expression in eternity of God&#8217;s becoming a man in humanity and man&#8217;s being conformed to God in divinity.</li>	<li>This is what God desires and is His heart&#8217;s delight, and this is also what God is waiting for in His good pleasure.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Hymns, #948, #949, and #972 are all on Christ as our hope of glory. Stanza 1 of Hymns, #948 says, &#8220;Myst&#8217;ry hid from ages now revealed to me, / &#8217;Tis the Christ of God&#8217;s reality. / He embodies God, and He is life to me, / And the glory of my hope He&#8217;ll be.&#8221; The chorus reads, &#8220;Glory, glory, Christ is life in me! / Glory, glory, what a hope is He! / Now within my spirit He&#8217;s the mystery! / Then the glory He will be to me.&#8221; Stanza 2 says, &#8220;In my spirit He regenerated me, / In my soul He&#8217;s now transforming me. / He will change my body like unto His own, / Wholly making me the same as He.&#8221; Stanza 3 says, &#8220;Now in life and nature He is one with me; / Then in Him, the glory, I will be; / I&#8217;ll enjoy His presence for eternity / With Him in complete conformity.&#8221;<p>Hymns, #972 is on the central thought of God. Stanza 1 says, &#8220;Lo, the central thought of God / Is that He be one with man; / He to man is everything / That He might fulfill His plan.&#8221; Stanza 9 says, &#8220;God in man and man in God / Mutual dwelling thus possess; / God the content is to man, / And the man doth God express.&#8221; Today God is in man, and man is in God. God and man thus possess a mutual dwelling. God is man&#8217;s content, and man is God&#8217;s expression.<p>Now we know that God&#8217;s desire and His intention are to be man&#8217;s life. The central thought of God is that He be one with man; He wants to be everything to man that He might fulfill His plan. Therefore, He Himself became a man through incarnation to accomplish redemption. Then He entered into resurrection and released His divine life. In His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit comes into us and regenerates us. After He regenerates us, He dwells in our spirit, and from that time on He wants to spread out daily from our spirit. He wants to permeate all the parts of our soul, including our mind, emotion, and will, and thus transform our whole being into God: our mind transformed into God&#8217;s mind, our emotion transformed into God&#8217;s emotion, and our will transformed into God&#8217;s will. Thus, we become God-men. But there remains a part of us which is still not transformed, and that is our body. After we are saved, the part that is the most troublesome to us today is our body, and this is the part that is the most difficult to deal with.<p>However, the Lord has given us a promise, and this promise is that He will come to transfigure our body. This is the third part of transformation, which is to bring our body into glory. Glory is God expressed. Therefore, to be brought into glory is to be brought into God Himself that we may fully enjoy God. This is the peak, the consummation, of transformation, in which we are transformed to such a degree that we are the same as God. Except for the fact that we have no part in God&#8217;s person, that is, the Godhead, we are exactly the same as God in His life, His nature, and His outward expression, His glory. This is clearly revealed in God&#8217;s holy Word.<p>Today God is a mystery in us, and in the future this mystery will be the glory. God is in our spirit, and our spirit is full of God. The God who is in our spirit is permeating our soul daily, spreading out from our spirit day by day. He does not reason with us. When we agree, He comes; even when we disagree, He comes. He is not only permeating our whole being but is also spreading outward from our spirit. The God who indwells us does not reason with us. He is the only One who is; we are not. We must decrease, and He must increase. Not only so, after He comes, He would not let us go; He wants us to stay with Him. God is in our spirit, and every day He also works to occupy our mind, our emotion, and our will. He is within every part of our being. Therefore, we have a hymn that says, &#8220;Thy Spirit, Lord, in mine, I pray, / O&#8217;erflow my being as a flood, / That every part with glory shine / And everywhere be Thee and God&#8221; (Hymns, #489, stanza 8). This means that we have God in our spirit, and our entire soul is also occupied by God. Hence, we are God-men. What we still lack today is the transfiguration of our body. However, we have a glorious hope, that is, that one day He will come to transfigure our body so that we may enter into God fully. Then from the inside to the outside we will have the life of God, the nature of God, and the glorious expression of God. Moreover, we will be in God. This is the central revelation of the holy Scriptures.<p>In this conference, my only burden is to show you God&#8217;s salvation in life. The first step of God&#8217;s salvation in life is to regenerate us. The second step is to transform us in our soul. The third step is that He will conform us from within to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son. This firstborn Son of God is mysterious. He was God, who came into humanity, put on humanity, and died on the cross to terminate everything negative and release His life. Then He resurrected and became a life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit now comes into us. He is the firstborn Son of God, and God is conforming us to the image of this firstborn Son of God. In God&#8217;s firstborn Son there is God and there is also man; there is death and there is also the effectiveness of death; there is resurrection and there is also the power of resurrection. He has everything in Him. This all-inclusive One now lives in us. Do we want God? He is here. Do we want uplifted humanity? It is also here. We who have God and allow God to transform us within are truly the men above all men. Not only do we have God, but we also have the uplifted humanity. Every believer is a Christ-man, and a Christ-man is a God-man. In our spirit is God, and in our soul-our mind, emotion, and will-is God. Our whole being is God. Now we are waiting for the fourth step of God&#8217;s salvation in life, that is, the transfiguration and glorification of our body.<h2 class=head1>I. THE DEFINITION OF GLORIFICATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Objectively, Glorification Is That the Redeemed Believers Will Be Brought into the Glory of God to Participate in the Glory of God</h2><p>Objectively, glorification is that the redeemed believers will be brought into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God (Heb. 2:10a; 1 Pet. 5:10a). This is the objective definition of glorification. It seems that today the glory of God is far away in the heavens, and we, the redeemed ones, are here on the earth; there is a great distance separating the two. Sometimes we feel that we are very far away from the glory of God, but this kind of feeling is only partially accurate.<h2 class=head2>B. Subjectively, Glorification Is That the Matured Believers Will Manifest from within Them, by Their Maturity in Life, the Glory of God as the Element of Their Maturity in Life</h2><p>Subjectively, glorification is that the matured believers will manifest from within them, by their maturity in life, the glory of God as the element of their maturity in life (Rom. 8:17-18, 21; 2 Cor. 4:17). This is the subjective definition of glorification. We may use an example to illustrate subjective glorification. When a flower in the garden begins to grow, it is just a little green tender sprout. The more it grows, however, the more mature it becomes. Gradually flower buds begin to appear. If you continue to water the plant, it will grow more. After a while the plant will blossom. When the flowers are in full bloom, that is the glorification. The glory of the flowers does not come from without; rather, it grows out from within. Therefore, on the one hand, we have a hope of glory in that Christ is coming to glorify us. This is objective. On the other hand, we are being transformed into the image of the Lord, with glory upon glory, that is, from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18). This is not glory descending on us; rather, it is glory growing out from within us. In springtime when all kinds of flowers are blooming, none of these beautiful flowers descend on the stems from the outside. Rather, they grow out from within the plant itself. If you are a lover of the Lord, and if you let the Lord live in you and you live by the Lord, then when people observe you, they will see the glory of God upon you. This glory is subjective and not objective.<p>Our entering into glory consists of these two aspects of glorification. Suppose you do not live by the Lord, and you do not live Christ. You simply do whatever you like, and in whatever you do, although big sins are rare, small sins are frequent. If you are such a Christian, you can freely lose your temper or give others an angry stare at home, and no one in the church is able to deal with you. If you are such a person, there is no glory of the Lord upon you, and there is no glory of God at all to be seen in you. Yet you say that when Christ comes, you will be glorified and you will enter into glory. Let me tell you this: Yes, you will enter into glory when Christ returns, but that glory will be only a tiny bit of glory. Therefore, in 1 Corinthians 15:41 the apostle Paul said, &#8220;There is another glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.&#8221; How can the glory of the star be compared with the glory of the sun or of the moon? I am afraid that at the Lord&#8217;s coming, Paul&#8217;s glory will be great, and you will be just a tiny star that can hardly be seen. Will you be glorious there? You will not be glorious there in glory.<p>Today if you love the Lord, and you live out the Lord&#8217;s glory from within you, then at the Lord&#8217;s coming, He will place you in a glory of the highest degree. But if you still behave in your old way-staring at others angrily, gossiping, criticizing at will, and though rarely committing big sins, you are frequently committing small sins-do you think you will be as glorious as the apostle Paul when the Lord comes back? Glory is given by the Lord, but the degree of glory must be established by you. There is also a class of people who are defeated and will not enter into glory. They will go into a darkness where they will be gnashing their teeth.<p>Today the Lord has given us gifts, and He wants us to apply the gifts and minister them to others. Nevertheless, many of us live carelessly on the earth and do not use our gifts. The Lord said that when He comes back, we will have to give an account before Him. At that time He may say to us, &#8220;Evil and slothful slave, be cast into the outer darkness&#8221; (Matt. 25:26-30). Therefore, there are two sides to this matter. Today pitiful Christianity teaches people only one side, telling people that once you believe in Jesus, His precious blood bears the full responsibility, and you are forgiven of all your sins. This is not wrong. However, the Lord Jesus forgives your sins in order that you may live in His life. If you do not live in His life, He will still need to deal with you, even though He has already forgiven you. He will settle the account with you at His coming back. This is clearly taught in the holy Scriptures.<p>Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 4:17 tells us that the momentary lightness of affliction which we suffer now for the Lord is working out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory. Today if we endure sufferings for the Lord, this will increase the weight of glory that we will receive from the Lord. Romans 8:17 also says that if we suffer with the Lord, we will also be glorified with Him. These all prove that the degree of glory we are to receive in the future is built up by us today.<p>We thank the Lord that we have been regenerated. We have Him in us as our life and our supply. We daily receive from Him the supply for us to be metabolically transformed. Our being transformed in this way every day is our growth in life. And our growth in life is the building up of the degree of our glorification. If we have not been living out the glory of the Lord on the earth, how can we expect that He will suddenly put His glory upon us at His coming back? Therefore, today if we are living out God on the earth, God becomes the glory upon us. When the Lord comes back, He will say, &#8220;Well done, good and faithful slave....Enter into the joy of your master&#8221; (Matt. 25:23). This is to enter into glory.<p>I also am human like you. I often have weaknesses and failures, but I am always in fear and trembling. Often when a certain matter comes to me, I consider before the Lord whether this is what the Lord wants. What the Lord wants for us is to live Him out. He wants us to live Him out in difficult situations, and He wants us to live Him out also in smooth situations. The apostle Paul said, &#8220;For to me, to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21a). He also said, &#8220;According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&#8221; (v. 20). This magnification is the glory.<h2 class=head2>C. Regeneration Is Accomplished in Our Spirit, Transformation Is through Our Soul, and Glorification Is Consummated in Our Body</h2><p>Regeneration is accomplished in our spirit, transformation is through our soul, and glorification is consummated in our body (John 3:6b; Rom. 12:2; 8:23, 30).<h2 class=head1>II. THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GLORY OF GOD- THE GLORY OF GOD IS GOD HIMSELF, AND THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD IS THE GLORY OF GOD</h2><p>What is the glory of God? The glory of God is God Himself (Jer. 2:11), and the manifestation of God is the glory of God (Acts 7:2). When you live out God, that is the glory of God. That is the glory which grows out from the growth in life. The blooming of beautiful flowers does not come from above. Instead, it grows metabolically out from the elements of life within.<h2 class=head1>III. THE REALITY OF THE BELIEVERS&#8217; GLORIFICATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Believers&#8217; Glorification Is Their Gaining of God Himself</h2><p>The reality of the believers&#8217; glorification is their gaining of God Himself. Without God, we do not have glory. When we gain God, we are glorified. The measure of God that we have determines the measure of our glory.<h2 class=head2>B. The Believers&#8217; Entering into the Glory of God to Participate in the Glory of God Is Their Entering into God Himself to Enjoy God Himself</h2><p>The believers&#8217; entering into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God is their entering into God Himself to enjoy God Himself. God does not give us great glory objectively merely for us to make a display. God manifests Himself in us that we may enjoy Him. The more we enjoy God and the more God we have in us, the more we have His glory. The more we enjoy God, the more we are full of glory. Regardless of whether you are young or old, rich or poor, as long as you enjoy God and experience God, you are glorious in the eyes of others. To you, you are simply enjoying God. To others, however, you are manifesting the glory of God. You are glorifying God, and God is expressed through you.<h2 class=head2>C. The Believers&#8217; Being Transformed in the Divine Life Today Is God&#8217;s Being Expressed in the Believers as Glory; Hence, This Daily Transformation Is from Glory to Glory</h2><p>The believers&#8217; being transformed in the divine life today is God&#8217;s being expressed in the believers as glory; hence, this daily transformation is from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18b). The practical, subjective glory of God in us is a glory that progresses from one degree to another degree. This expressing of God is progressive and advancing; hence, it is from glory to glory.<h2 class=head2>D. The Consummation of Glory into Which the Believers Will Enter by Their Transformation in Life Is That the Believers Will Be Glorified- Their Body Will Be Redeemed, and They Will Thereby Enter into the Glory of God to Fully Enjoy God as Glory</h2><p>The consummation of glory into which the believers will enter by transformation in life is that they will be glorified-their body will be redeemed, and they will thereby enter into the glory of God to fully enjoy God as glory (Rom. 8:21, 23, 30). The ultimate result of the believers&#8217; transformation in life is that they gain God and enjoy God. This is the principle today, and it will be the same principle in the future.<h2 class=head1>IV. GLORIFICATION BEING THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION IN LIFE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Believers&#8217; Arriving at Glorification Is the Climax of Their Maturity in the Life of God</h2><p>Glorification is the ultimate consummation of God&#8217;s salvation in life. It is God&#8217;s salvation in life saving us to the uttermost through regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification. The believers&#8217; arriving at glorification is the climax of their maturity in the life of God.<h2 class=head2>B. The Believers&#8217; Reaching the Peak of Glorification Is Their Reaching the Climax of God&#8217;s Salvation in Life</h2><p>The believers&#8217; reaching the peak of glorification is their reaching the climax of God&#8217;s salvation in life.<h2 class=head1>V. THE BELIEVERS&#8217; GLORIFICATION BEING THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY FOR THE SATISFACTION OF GOD&#8217;S DESIRE</h2><p>With regard to God, the believers&#8217; glorification is the accomplishment of God&#8217;s economy for the satisfaction of God&#8217;s desire.<h2 class=head2>A. The Full Expression  of the Believers&#8217; Glorification Is the New Jerusalem, Which Will Be Manifested in Glory</h2><p>The full expression of the believers&#8217; glorification is the New Jerusalem, which will be manifested in glory (Rev. 21:10-11). The New Jerusalem is the ultimate glory. The New Jerusalem will be constituted with the glory of God to be the expression of God.<h2 class=head2>B. This Is the Full Expression in Eternity of God&#8217;s Becoming a Man in Humanity and Man&#8217;s Being Conformed to God in Divinity</h2><p>This is the full expression in eternity of God&#8217;s becoming a man in humanity and man&#8217;s being conformed to God in divinity. God is expressed in humanity, and man is expressed in divinity. The greatest corporate expression of God&#8217;s becoming man and man&#8217;s being conformed to God is the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head2>C. This Is What God Desires and Is His Heart&#8217;s Delight, and This Is Also What God Is Waiting For in His Good Pleasure</h2><p>This is what God desires and is His heart&#8217;s delight, and this is also what God is waiting for in His good pleasure. We hope for this, and God also hopes for this.</body></html>
