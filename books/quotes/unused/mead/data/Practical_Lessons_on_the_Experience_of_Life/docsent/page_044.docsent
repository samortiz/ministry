   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING A PROPER HEART Having an Understanding Mind</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all have to learn that for God's dealing our mind must be as clear as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to take a good picture with a camera, the lens must be very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our mind must be very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The minds of many brothers and sisters are not clear concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are still covered under a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The veil has not been taken away 2 Cor 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why we have to come to the meetings, listen to messages, read the Word, and read spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This will help us to clear up the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The enemy Satan always tries his best to keep people away from the proper knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be without knowledge is to be under a cover.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What our mind needs is to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must have an understanding mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Scriptures speak of an understanding heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Kings 3:9 Solomon asks, "Give therefore to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people and to discern between good and evil."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the parable of the sower in Matthew 13, the seed is sown in the heart, but if someone does not understand the word, Satan snatches it away v. 19 . For the heart to be understanding means that the mind of the heart is in a good condition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the mind is the "lens" of the whole person, it must be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must have a clear understanding, a clear mind concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the minds of too many Christians are not clear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is hard to speak the things of God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are under darkness; their mind is blinded, and they are "darkened in their understanding" Eph 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Having a Loving Emotion</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In addition, our emotion must be loving.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to love the Lord from our whole heart Mark 12:30 , that is, from the emotional part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our emotion should be loving, not toward something else but toward God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some Christians have a clear mind, but they are short of a loving heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not love the Lord with their emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their treasure is not the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus said, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" Matt 6:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our treasure is the Lord Himself, then our emotion toward Him is loving; we will love Him in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some may say, "Don't be too emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You are too emotional toward the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not emotional enough; we need to be more emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I wish that every one of you would weep for the Lord each day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to be emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A person can never be spiritual if he is not emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to be spiritual, we have to be emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Having a Right Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our conscience must also be right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It must not be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to be right with God, right with others, and right with everything in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our conscience we must be right toward everyone and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Having a Soft and Submissive Will</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, our will must be soft and submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be soft is one hundred percent different from being weak.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our will must be strong but not hard or stiff.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our mind must be clear before the Lord; our emotion must be loving; our conscience must be completely right with the Lord, being wrong in nothing; and our will must be soft and submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we put these four things together, we have a proper heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to deal with these four matters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should check whether or not our mind is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If not, then our heart can never be right, because our mind is darkened.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then we should check, do we love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Are we right according to our conscience with God, man, and everything?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is our will soft and submissive?</S>
