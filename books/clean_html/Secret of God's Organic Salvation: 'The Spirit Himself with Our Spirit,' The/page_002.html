<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class="msg">THE SECRET OF REGENERATION</h1><h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Divine Trinity&rsquo;s seeking of the lost sinners:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Second of the Divine Trinity, the Son, came to seek the lost sinners outside of them objectively on the cross, as a shepherd seeks his lost sheep&mdash; Luke 15:4.</li>	<li>Then the Third of the Divine Trinity, the Spirit, comes to seek the lost sinners with the enlightening Word within them subjectively in their heart, as a woman seeking her lost coin by lighting a lamp&mdash;Luke 15:8.</li>	<li>This is the initial sanctification of the Spirit to separate a lost sinner from among all the others unto repentance to God for the receiving of Christ&rsquo;s redemption&mdash;1 Pet. 1:2; see Chapter Two, point II.A.1.</li>	</ol></li><li>The secret of regeneration&mdash;the first section of God&rsquo;s organic salvation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Spirit of reality, who has sanctified the lost sinners unto repentance, comes to convict the sinners:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Concerning sin, which is from Adam.</li>		<li>Concerning righteousness, which is of Christ.</li>		<li>Concerning judgment, which belongs to Satan&mdash; John 16:8-11.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>That they may be born anew of:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Water (the water of baptism signifying death).</li>		<li>The Spirit (who has sanctified the sinner from among others, and who is the reality of resurrection) in their spirit enlivened by Christ in resurrection&mdash;John 3:3, 5.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Through the resurrection of Christ that He may impart the divine life into them as the authority for them to be the children of God, begotten of God as His species&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:12-13.<br />	Definition:<br />	When Christ was resurrected, all His believers, chosen and given to Him by God, were included in Him. Hence, they were all resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6) and regenerated through Him that they may have the eternal life as the authority for them to be the children of God as His species.</li>	<li>This is &ldquo;that which is born of the Spirit [the Spirit of God] is spirit [the spirit of a sinner born anew]&rdquo;&mdash;John 3:6b.</li>	<li>Such a regeneration, a new birth, is a great washing:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Purging the regenerated believer from the oldness of his old creation&mdash;Titus 3:5.</li>		<li>Reconditioning, remaking, remodeling, our old being in life&mdash;Titus 3:5; cf. Matt. 19:28.</li>		</ol></li>	Definition:<br />	The Greek word for <i>regeneration</i> in Titus 3:5 is different from that for <i>regenerated</i> in 1 Peter 1:23. The only other place this word is used is in Matthew 19:28, where it is used for the restoration in the millennium. Here it refers to a change from one state to another. Being born again is the commencing of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God&rsquo;s new creation, a process that makes us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling, with life.</li>	<li>This is to drink the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13) as the living water:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Which the Lord Jesus gives to a believer regenerated by Him&mdash;John 4:10; 7:37.</li>		<li>Which is the Spirit flowing as the river of water of life from the throne of God&mdash;Rev. 22:1, 17; 21:6.</li>		<li>Which will become a spring of water gushing up into eternal life&mdash;John 4:14.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The experiences of the above points A through F are all by exercising the spirit of a repentant and saved sinner through prayer (Eph. 6:18) to call on the name of the Lord (Rom. 10:13).</li>	<li>The experiences of the above points A through F are also by receiving the living and abiding word of God (the word of the Spirit of life&mdash;John 6:63)&mdash;1 Pet. 1:23.</li>	<li>Such a saved one receives the Spirit of sonship in his spirit&mdash;Gal. 4:5-6; Rom. 8:15.</li>	<li>The Spirit of God with our spirit witnesses that we, the regenerated believers, are the children of God&mdash;Rom. 8:16.</li>	<li>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God&mdash;Rom. 8:14.</li>	<li>Such a regenerated believer in Christ is a part of the bride as the increase of Christ the Bridegroom&mdash;John 3:3, 5-6, 29-30.</li>	<li>Such a child of God should learn to worship God, who is Spirit, with his regenerated spirit mingled with God&rsquo;s Spirit as one spirit&mdash;John 4:24; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>	<li>He should also serve God with his spirit in the gospel&mdash;Rom. 1:9; 12:11.</li>	</ol></li></ol>
