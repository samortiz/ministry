   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THE CONDESCENSION OF THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only the One who is the highest can condescend to be the lowest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The whole life of our Lord shows us that He condescended in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we read the four Gospels, we see a condescending life unfold before us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is one of the reasons that we admire and worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are many aspects to His condescension, but the most beautiful one is His co-working with His creatures and employing them to be the instruments for His work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He creates things out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As soon as He says something, it is done.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His words are absolute and infinite.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Behind His words is His mighty power which accomplishes what He says.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He does not need any helper or raw material.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His authority is sufficient to accomplish everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Creator does not need co-workers or instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet, how amazing are His acts on the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He used the seven loaves and a few fish that the disciples offered Him to feed four thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If He could feed four thousand with seven loaves and a few fish, He could have fed them without any loaf or fish by creating the loaves and the fish instead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For Him both ways are equally easy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He could perform miracles, any kind of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For Him, creating something out of nothing and increasing something out of a little is equally easy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But He condescended.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was happy to share His glory and work with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He wanted to bring His people into the work that He was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not want to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He did not want to do everything by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wanted to work together with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He desired to see His people participating in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was happy to lead the creatures into the work of the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He wanted them to know that when they consecrated themselves, obeyed Him, and trusted in His work, He would use them and what they had to manifest His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Oh what glory this is!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He always desired that His people would join themselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When He had to go to Jerusalem, He could have created a colt with His creative power in the same way that He created many animals when He furnished the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet He was happy to have the disciples go and fetch it for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He even said that the Lord has need of them Matt 21:3 , which can be translated as the Lord lacks them or the Lord is in need of them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Did the Creator really have any lack?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Did He really have any need?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But He said this Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He knew beforehand that there was a donkey with a colt tied beside her in the next village.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He also knew that no man had ever sat on the colt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And He knew that the owner would question the disciples when they unloosened the colt and what they should say in order for the owner to release it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But His condescension lies in the fact that He was happy to perform this type of miracle rather than set aside the existing colt or the disciples errands by performing a miracle of creating a colt.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He could have created a colt a hundred times better than any other colt with one word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet, and I say this most reverently, He was pleased to be helped by men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was happy to see other men making contributions to His earthly journey.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was happy to have men as His companions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was willing to receive something from His loved ones to help Him in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He could go on alone with no need of men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet He did not want to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He wanted to condescend a little and receive men s consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He wanted to elevate men and give them a part in God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said, I have need of them, I lack them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It seems that He was saying that His lack would not have been met if the owner of the colt had refused to give it to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He had a need, and He desired to see men fulfill this need.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He would rather receive what He needed from the hands of His people than through His own miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If His people would be faithful to give, He would ride on their colt and enter Jerusalem to receive men s Hosannas.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the believers were lazy or held back, He would rather wait and allow His need to go unanswered.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was not willing to exercise His divine power to work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was not in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is His will; He wants to do things this way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not know why, but we know that this is what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All those who understand the Lord s heart should find their own responsibility in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the one hand, the Lord condescends.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the other hand, He elevates us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Are we worthy of such elevation?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the creatures are not elevated through the opportunity to take care of the Creator s need, what else could this be?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we consider this, we should murmur less when the Holy Spirit prompts us to consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is an absolute mistake to think that when we offer ourselves and what we have to God that we are doing God a favor or earning credits from God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our consecration and God s acceptance of our consecration is God s elevating and bestowing His glory on us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is the Most High God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All the angels in heaven are His servants.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All the cattle and goats on the hills are His.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He owns all the gold and silver on earth and thousands of worlds are His.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Does He have any lack?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Does He need the power and material supply of humble and poor people?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Is He really helpless and seeking our help?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Or is He elevating and uplifting us through these needs and making us realize that humble, lowly, poor, and destitute men such as ourselves can be counted worthy of supplying God s needs and becoming His help?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is indeed too wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Is it not a wonder that God wants our strength and material supply?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Is it not a wonder that a king would want the possessions of a beggar?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Is there no one who can supply Him other than beggars?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Or does He have other intentions in mind?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Should a beggar who is given the privilege of helping his king feel flattered or self-accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Offering to our King is our extraordinary privilege.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The believers should consider what sacrifice there can be for little creatures such as we to offer anything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is our privilege and special right to be able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>His willingness to accept our offering is sufficient honor for us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>His asking of us is a far higher honor.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Because our hearts are too dull and ignorant of the honor of consecration, we boast of our suffering, sacrifice, and consecration to the Lord as if we have earned some credit from Him!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Oh, how believers are unappreciative of their elevation!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If the present workers of the Lord realized this fact, they would not be so timid and careful.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They would not save up treasures for themselves and would not consider their offering of a little money as a favor to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The words of Mordecai are very fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He told queen Esther, For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place...and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Esth.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Dear brothers and sisters, today God s people have many needs.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>God considers these needs as His needs.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>He will fill these needs.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>However, He does not want to deliver His people by performing miracles by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He wants to use you.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Are you willing?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He could send messengers from heaven to sound the call and revive His people.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He could perform many works of wonders and strange signs to wake up sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He could once again send manna from heaven to feed His servants and maids who live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But if He did these things, you would lose your glory and your share in God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He can perform miracles and grant deliverance, but He wants to do them through you.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He does not want to do them by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The question is whether or not we are worthy of His elevation.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He is willing that He Himself should condescend and is happy to elevate us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He is happy for us to have a share in all His works.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He is humble enough to say that He has needs so that a door will be open for us to help Him and gain His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If this is the case, why would we not consecrate ourselves to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Why would we not offer our riches?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>All those who fail to grasp the present opportunities are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In summary, God needs man in His work of saving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If you will not help, God will raise up others to take your place.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The work of helping other believers go on needs man.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If you draw back, God will raise up others to take your place.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>God has given you money so that you will supply the need of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If you fail, God will raise up others.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>God s needs must be met, but who will meet them?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Who will step forward to preach His word, and who will fill up God s glory?</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>If you do not step forward, do not think that God will be short of help.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>He will raise up others.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>But it will be a pity that you will not be able to share in the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place Esth.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Therefore brothers, let no one take your crown Rev 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>God s need today is greater than at any other time.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>He is bestowing special glory to believers of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>He is still willing to condescend.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>But are there believers who are willing to marvel with gratitude for such grace from God and fulfill God s need without feeling self-satisfied because of their awareness of such a high honor?</S>
