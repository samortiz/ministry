<h2 class="head2">Migration</h2><p>After the brothers and sisters are trained, they can be sent out. The apostles are the ones who should remain in Jerusalem. In reading the Bible many people think that the twelve disciples were supposed to go to the ends of the earth. If that were the case, how could the twelve disciples travel through the whole earth? The Bible shows us that the twelve apostles remained in Jerusalem and that Samaria was taken by Philip. Peter's visit to Samaria was a temporary one. It would have been wrong for him to settle in Samaria. The gospel work is a relay race; it is not done by one man alone. Today the co-workers should remain in their own Jerusalems. After they gain some people, they should send them out. If they do not send out people, persecutions will come and difficulties will arise. In order for the gospel to go out, there is the need for migration. The apostles should remain in Jerusalem and work there, and all the brothers and sisters should receive training from the church. At the same time, the church should care for the poor, the unbelievers, and the new believers; it should learn how to deal with them and how to gain them. After they are perfected, they should be sent out. This kind of coordination will be effective; it will spread to all the places. Not only do the apostles have to preach the gospel; all the brothers and sisters have to preach the gospel. Philip was not specially ordained to be an evangelist, just as Stephen was not specially ordained to be a martyr. We think that only special brothers can do special works. Yet, Philip was simply one of those who served tables. We have to realize that Samaria was taken over by such a table-server. Coordination requires that everyone be consecrated and that everyone offer up what he has.</p><p>Perhaps many will say, "I do not have the eloquence. I do not know how to preach the gospel.'' You have to start learning today. If you preach well, you have to preach. If you do not preach well, you still have to preach. Perhaps when you preach the first time, the sinners will not be saved. But when you preach the second time, they will be saved.</p><h2 class="head2">The Working Saints Offering Up<br />Their Material Riches</h2><p>Whoever wants to be a Sunday-goer or a spectator can continue to be a pew-member. But in the church, everyone has to offer himself up. To the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs, I have to say that you are no longer working for money. If a person does not offer up his riches, his consecration is invisible and intangible. No one can tell when he has taken back such a kind of consecration. The Bible says that the disciples laid everything at the feet of the apostles (Acts 4:35).</p><h2 class="head1">ALL MYSTICAL THINGS<br />BECOMING TANGIBLE AND PRACTICABLE</h2><p>Today every mystical thing has to become practicable. For example, Christ says that we have to humble ourselves and love others. Is this good? Yes, it is good. But the Lord's Word does not stop here; He charges us to wash each other's feet. Today no one would admit that he is proud. Neither would anyone put up a sign and say that he is humble. Yet whether or not you are humble depends on whether you have washed each other's feet. All the mystical things have to become tangible before they can become reliable.</p><p>The book of James says that if there are poor brothers among us, and we love them, we cannot merely lift our hands and say, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled'' (2:16). Mystical love is eternal; yet it is useless as far as practical matters are concerned. It is more practical to give the poor brother a bowl of rice.</p><p>If a brother offends me, I have to forgive him. But if this forgiveness remains mystical, I can forgive him fifty or a hundred times, and others will still not realize it. This kind of forgiveness must be transformed into a kind of tangible dealing.</p><p>The same is true about withstanding Satan. If you withstand Satan in an inward way, you do not know whether or not the withstanding works. But if you say a few words, Satan will go away.</p><p>The same is true with baptism. Once a person believes, he needs to be baptized. Perhaps some will think that it is too quick to baptize a person right after he believes. But this is wrong. Believing with the heart is something that is invisible. One must have the visible baptism before the matter is settled. Believing with the heart is mystical; being baptized in the body is tangible.</p><p>The same is true with consecration. A mystical consecration is not solid. Many consecrations remain mystical. Many say to the Lord, "I consecrate everything.'' But the Gospel of Luke shows us that Zaccheus' consecration was very concrete. He offered up his possessions (19:8). The Lord's command to him was also very concrete. During the past one hundred years, the church has received many mystical consecrations. But the consecrations at the time of the early apostles were tangible. At that time, when a man handed himself over, everything was settled. Every brother and sister should hand over himself or herself; everyone should submit to the authority of the church and be coordinated together with other brothers and sisters. Brother Witness said it well: When the church is advancing and the material offering falls behind, it is the fault of the brothers and sisters; however, if the material offering is adequate, yet the gospel falls behind, it is the fault of the co-workers. The brothers and sisters who participate in the spiritual services have to be coordinated, and the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should also be coordinated. Some sisters wanted to offer up something, but I declined their offerings, because they had not offered up themselves yet. First Corinthians tells us that God first receives us, then ours. The person has to be given first, before possessions and time can be given.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING AFTER ABSOLUTE ONES</h2><p>The coordination that we are speaking of today is one that costs the co-workers' their lives. It is one that also costs the other brothers' and sisters' their lives. All the brothers and sisters must have the Lord as their center, and they have to offer up everything for the gospel and for the service. We do not consider being a Christian as our second profession. Some are professing Christians, but we should be "professional'' Christians. Christ should be our first profession. All the brothers and sisters who are holding jobs should offer up all their time. The Lord demands that we deny ourselves for the sake of loving Him. The Lord's demand is the same today as it was in the first century. In God's Word there is no place for halfway ones; there are only absolute ones.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi: May the Lord forbid that tonight's words be merely mysterious words in our heart. May they be transformed to outward realities. May they not be merely notions, but realities. May they not be merely doctrines, but life. May they not be something that is nice to hear, but something that is good to see. May we not have fragmentary services, but complete services. May we not only have a consecration of the heart and the mouth, but a consecration of the hands and the feet. Amen.</p>
