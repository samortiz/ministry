   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BREAKING BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this same year 1921 I went to the Bible regarding a number of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I said to myself, "There are so many nominal Christians in the present day church, yet the Bible says that only the saved ones are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are so many denominations today, yet there is no Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church, or any other denomination in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why then am I a member of the Methodist Church?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since God's Word is not saying it, why am I doing it?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Methodist bishop was a good friend of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being a personal friend of the bishop was one thing, but the fact that denominations are unscriptural was another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I saw that the system of pastors was not scriptural and that meetings should be practiced according to scriptural principles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the beginning the light I had on these matters was small.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was like the blind man in Mark 8 who, although he could see men, could only see them as trees walking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I had seen a little, but I did not see clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One afternoon in the first half of 1922, I was much troubled concerning the matter of the breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I had seen from the Bible that believers should often come together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason I said to myself, "Why is it that in the church today the breaking of bread is held only four times a year?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Besides, among the ones who came to break bread, some were regular movie-goers, some were habitual mahjong players, some even questioned whether or not the Lord Jesus could be considered a good man, and some were evidently not even children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I saw such people going to receive Holy Communion, I began to consider whether or not I could go.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I could not go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Following my salvation, up to 1922, I had never been to receive the so-called Holy Communion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For many days I searched the Bible concerning this matter of breaking bread.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Was a pastor required to preside over it?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Was it true that only those who had received ordination could break it, while those who had not received ordination could not?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I spent much time studying but found nothing like this in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This matter of a pastor presiding over the breaking of bread was not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At this point I was very troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Though I wished so and though the Bible said that we should often break bread in remembrance of the Lord, I had no such place to break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One Thursday afternoon following the Bible study, I sought out my friend, Leland Wang, for a little talk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I shared my feeling that according to the Bible we should break bread often in remembrance of the Lord, but that I had not done it once since being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I also mentioned that there were some in the denominations who are clearly not the children of God and with whom I could not break bread, and that there was the further problem that according to them no one could break bread except the pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I told him, "Neither you nor I are pastors; so even if we gathered all the true believers together, we would be considered unqualified to break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Isn't this puzzling?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Wang took my hands and said, "God has been leading me exactly the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Last night I could not sleep, but was continually praying and searching concerning this very matter of whether or not believers should break bread, and whether or not it is necessary for a pastor to preside over it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I realized from my prayer and searching that in no place does it say that only ordained pastors can break bread."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I heard this, I thanked the Lord because He had been leading us in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since we had clearly seen the principles of meeting in the Bible, I said, "No day is better to begin than today; let us begin breaking bread on the coming Lord's Day."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since we were settled on the time to begin, we began to discuss the place.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our house was larger, but I had not told my mother how I felt about this matter lest she think that we young people were rebelling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Leland Wang was living in a house borrowed from a girls' school and was moving soon, so he felt it would not be too convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I said, "It does not matter; let us meet at your place."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we had made that decision, I was exceedingly happy on Friday and Saturday, for I was anticipating the happy day which was soon coming.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the evening of the Lord's Day came, I informed my mother that I was going to Leland Wang's home.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She asked, "What for?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I replied, "To take care of something very important."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That night three of us Leland Wang, his wife, and I met in his little house to break bread and drink the cup together.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as I live, and even into eternity, I will remember that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I was never so close to the heavens as on that night!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That night the heavens came near to the earth!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All three of us could not help but weep!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On that day we knew what it meant to break bread in remembrance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a young boy, after being sprinkled, I had partaken of the Holy Communion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My response at that time was, "The bread is rather sour and the grape juice is rather sweet."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I understood nothing regarding the significance of breaking bread; I only realized that the bread was sour and the juice was sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But when the three of us broke bread that night in Leland Wang's home, I knew that this was a most precious matter to God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On that first occasion we learned what it meant to worship and remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We could do nothing but give praise and thanks to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After the first meeting we asked ourselves, What about the next meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some denominations observed the breaking of bread every three months, but what about us?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Bible tells us to remember the Lord often.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We felt from reading Acts 2, that at that time the breaking of bread was probably a daily matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Acts 20:7 says, "And on the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the basis of the word, therefore, we decided to observe the breaking of bread on every Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>From that time on, except when I was ill, traveling on the road, or prevented by some unexpected event, I always broke bread every Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Shortly afterward my mother discovered what we were doing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She did not object; she only commented that we were too bold.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Several months later, she also joined us in breaking bread.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Gradually the way the Lord was taking us began to have its outside effects.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There was talk that several members of the Nee family were baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The district superintendent of the Methodist Church came to inquire of us concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I said, "The only question is whether or not baptism by immersion is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If it is not scriptural, I am willing to stand before the congregation and confess my error; if it is scriptural, then I must obey."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He only said, "Yes, it is scriptural, but you should not be so legal."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If there were no need to be legal in one matter, there was no need to be legal in any matter.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It surprised me to find that while the Methodists had originally been our good friends, now because of baptism by immersion, they turned quite cold toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>From that day on I realized what it means to obey the Lord and that there is a price to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I also realized that people do not ordinarily consider baptism important; however, after one was baptized in a different way, they did consider it important.</S>
