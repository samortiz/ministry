   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Losing Natural Interest,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While Being Strengthened in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother, you have to take care of two things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, your life of contradiction must be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even when you do not find any interest in your work, you still have to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, you should be strengthened in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may have experienced the first point; that is, you have lost your natural interest in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in regards to the second point, you still have a responsibility and commitment, and you have no other choice but to carry this responsibility or else the church will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to rise up above death and face the crises in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people work because they are driven by a lust for work; if we stop those who work in this way from working, we are asking them for their life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother, you have to be delivered from any lust for work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Any such lust has to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But then you must be strengthened in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have to know that you are a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If He has a demand, He will surely give you the strength to meet this demand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we are old, our service is no longer a matter of preference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord told Peter that when he was young, he girded up his loins and walked wherever he wished.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when he was old, he would have to stretch out his hands, and another would carry him where he did not wish to go John 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the time when a worker is tested.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The greatest test of our consecration is when we work for the Lord because we see His need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is no longer a matter of preference but a matter of the Lord's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What we do during times of reluctance is more reliable than what we do during times of preference.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Supply in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not work for God when we feel like it and stop when we do not feel like it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to work in resurrection and look for the supply in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Resurrection is found in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the supply of the resurrection life is also found in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to experience a breakthrough with all the saints through the supply of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us forget about whether or not we have an interest or feeling concerning our work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When all the brothers and sisters give themselves to the church, they overcome together by the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul was once discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seems as if he wanted a break from his work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet as soon as Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, he was immediately constrained by the word Acts 18:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He had been reasoning and persuading every Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps he was frustrated and ready to take a rest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps he was pressed beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when Silas and Timothy showed up, he was constrained by the word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He continued to speak about Christ, returning to his former subject.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just when Paul was about to become discouraged, the coming of two young brothers strengthened his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps you do not have two young brothers to come to your aid yet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we hope that in the future they will come.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It would not be right for you to retire now.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you set your eyes on the problems and do not draw supply from the power of resurrection, your problems will become heavy weights; they will not lead you anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you have the supply of the Body, your life of contradiction may increase while your natural interest dies out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, death is terrible, but on the other hand, it is very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Under the operation of death, the power of resurrection will be manifested.</S>
