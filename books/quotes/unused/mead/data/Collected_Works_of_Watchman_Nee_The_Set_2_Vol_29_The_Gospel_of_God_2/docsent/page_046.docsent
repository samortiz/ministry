   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE BELIEVERS' SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE GEHENNA OF FIRE IN THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many places in the Bible that mention God's punishment for the defeated Christians in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will take a look at these places now.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, we will draw a conclusion concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE ENTRANCE INTO AND</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE POSITION IN THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us first consider Matthew 18:1-3.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst and said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here the disciples asked a question concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a question concerning greatness in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not a question concerning salvation and perdition, but a question concerning being great or small, high or low, in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus showed us that unless we turn and become like little children, we cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following this, verse 4 says, "He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 3 gives us the condition for entering the kingdom, while verse 4 gives us the way to be great in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 3 says that we must turn and become like children before we can enter the kingdom, and verse 4 says that if we continue to be children and humble ourselves, we will be the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows us that in the kingdom we should continue in the same way that we begin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The direction we face when we enter the kingdom should be the same direction we face when we continue in it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we must turn and become like little children; and to be great in the kingdom of the heavens, we must continue to be humble like children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here the Lord continues to bring up the matter of being like children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Following this, the Lord said, "And whoever receives one such little child because of My name, receives Me" v. 5 . Whoever receives someone like this child because of Christ's name, that is, someone who turns to become like a child and who continues to be humble like a child, receives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe in Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea" v. 6 . This word indicates that stumbling others is a bigger problem than suffering and being killed in an ignoble way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose someone kills you and casts your body into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are not even buried properly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Indeed this would be an unfortunate tragedy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if you stumble others, your fate will be worse than this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 7 says, "Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE GEHENNA OF FIRE IN THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 1 through 7 are the general words of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will just mention them briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We want to pay more attention to the words beginning in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus expanded on this matter to point out that it is not only wrong to stumble others, but it is a serious and grave matter even to stumble yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 8 says, "If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who does "you" refer to here?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verses 3 through 7, "you" refers to the disciples who asked the question in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the Lord Jesus answered them, He told them to be watchful and not to stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord's words in verse 8 are directed at the same people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a hand or a foot stumbles you, it is better to cut it off and cast it away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, this need not be taken literally.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If your hands steal and your feet walk in improper paths, that is, if there is sin and lust in you, you must deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire" v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord shows us that if Christians tolerate sin, they will suffer either the casting into the eternal fire with both hands and both feet, or the entering into life with one hand or one foot.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This shows us clearly that there are those who deal with their sins and lusts in this age and who will enter into the kingdom with one hand or one foot.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are also those who will leave their lusts unchecked and will be cast into the eternal fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The fire is an eternal fire, but it does not say that they will remain in the eternal fire forever.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What the Lord Jesus did not say is as significant as what He did say.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a person has become a Christian but his hands or feet sin all the time, he will suffer the punishment of the eternal fire in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will not suffer this punishment eternally, but will suffer it only in the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What does it mean to cut off a hand or a foot?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When a man cuts off his hand or foot, he can still sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If he does not have a foot, he can travel by car.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If one of his hands is cut off, he can still sin with the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not necessarily the Lord's intention that we cut off a hand or foot, for even if we do cut off a hand, we still cannot remove our lust.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, this word must not refer to the outward body, but to the inward lust.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What we have to cut off is that which drives us to sin.</S>
