   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORMING THE GROUPS BY THE WAY OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have the burden to teach you the details concerning the forming of the groups and the practice of the group meetings just as an English teacher would teach his students the ABCs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, I cannot do this with the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not think that the whole church is ready for this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I believe that some of the saints are ready.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To form the groups in the new way there is no need to touch any of the existing church meetings or group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can let them go on as they have been, without attempting to change or to terminate them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you desire to start a group meeting, you should first pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You should not do anything without praying first.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You should do everything by prayer and do everything according to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In your prayer, you may say to the Lord, Lord, I am burdened to have a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, give me the people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I cannot have the group meeting by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I need at least a few.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To form a group, you do not need a large number; even three to five saints are enough.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After you pray to the Lord, the Lord may tell you to go to fellowship with a certain brother.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While you are on your way to contact this brother, you should pray, Lord, what should I say to him?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do everything by prayer; this makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the brother agrees to join you, you should still pray, Lord, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My brother desires to join me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In such a situation you should pray and not dominate the other brother by telling him what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, you should ask him, Now that you have expressed your desire to join me, what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The other brother may propose that the two of you come together to pray and fellowship the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From the time that he says he will join you and you answer him by asking him what you should do, the two of you will be organically united in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Your relationship will be different from what it was before.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Immediately the Holy Spirit will confirm this, making the two of you one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The two of you will love each other more than ever.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then you will learn of him and he will learn of you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After you pray together, in a few days the Lord may lead you both to contact a third brother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through your prayerful contact with him, he may agree to join you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now you have a group of three.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can assure you that if you form your group in this way, everyone who joins your group will immediately become one with you organically.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not do anything according to the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do everything according to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord may lead you to contact another one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This one may live somewhat far away from you, and you may tell the Lord that he lives too far away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, that is your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of going according to your concept, you should follow the Lord s leading through your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Within a week or ten days, you may contact four or five saints who agree to join you in a group.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This way of grouping together is different from the way of arrangement or assignment by the elders, and it is also different from the way of forming groups according to geography or neighborhood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, both the way of prayer and the way of arrangement are needed in order to have the proper forming of the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In later messages I will say more concerning the way to form the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>OPENING OURSELVES TO THE MEMBERS OF OUR GROUP</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before getting four or five, you may have gotten two or three already.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You two or three should come together and pray and get to know each other.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although you may have met in the same church for years, you may not know how many children each other has.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, you may not know that the wife of one of the brothers has been ill for a considerable time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you had been practicing the proper grouping, within one hour after one of the group members became ill, you would have known it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In grouping together, the first thing to do is to know one another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever you come together, you should ask concerning the present situation of each group member.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may say that we know each other, but actually we do not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When one of our family members is sick, we may avoid telling others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may say that everyone in our family is well, when actually some are not well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead of opening our situation to one another, we hide things from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After opening to one another concerning our present situation, we should pray for one another and care for and help one another.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a further step in the practice of the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because we do not open ourselves to one another and do not have the mutual care for one another, we have lost our impact.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you will practice the new way, immediately you will have the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After forming a group, you should not go the next day to visit people by knocking on new doors.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Rather, the group members should pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord is living, and He is real.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is with us; but He is not with us in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the old way He is not living and He is not real to us, because we do not practice His organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we come together to fellowship, we still do not fully open ourselves to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, there has been little result from our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It seems that the Lord is not with us, or that He is with us only partially.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yes, the Lord is gracious, and He is broad.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He takes care of us, but that does not mean that He is happy with us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is happy with us to the extent that we open ourselves to our fellow members.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because we have never opened ourselves to our fellow members, we have very little impact.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When you go out to knock on doors, even the unbelievers can sense that between the two or three of you there are some problems.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is no need for you to tell them; they can sense that you have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That reduces your impact.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if you are really one, the unbelievers can sense this also.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They may say to themselves, How marvelous that these three people are one.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In my whole life I have never seen such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>That is the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>With such oneness and impact, surely the unbelievers will make the decision within themselves that they would like to join themselves to you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Perhaps they will not understand clearly what you preach to them, but after you leave they may say to one another, These people are sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They speak what they believe, and they speak what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After the day of Pentecost the believers did not deliberately practice communism.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To do so would have been a shame to them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, they had everything in common Acts 2:44-45; 4:32 in order to show the entire universe, including the demons, the angels, the Lord, and Satan, that they were truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Spontaneously, the impact was there 5:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>RECONSIDERING OUR WAY</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>TO VISIT PEOPLE FOR THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We need to adjust our way in baptizing the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>After getting a new one saved, you should not baptize him immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Furthermore, if possible you should avoid baptizing him in a bathtub.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To baptize people in a bathtub is neither stately nor dignified.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I admit that this is different from what I taught in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I told you from the beginning that I am like one who is experimenting in a laboratory.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I am studying in order to learn the proper way to practice the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Based on our former practice in Taipei, we learned that our way of baptizing people quickly should be reconsidered.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There we baptized so many people that we could not take care of them adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is not normal for a mother to have fifteen children in the same delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In Taipei we attempted to baptize as many people as we could in the shortest amount of time.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Eventually, we baptized thirty-eight thousand people, but we might have lost thirty-five thousand of these because they were not taken care of as they should have been.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We found out that this kind of practice was ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If seven hundred saints had baptized only three thousand people in a period of eighteen months, surely they could have cared adequately for each new one.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After praying in seeking the Lord s leading to form your group, you need to pray much concerning whom you should visit for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I believe the Holy Spirit will lead you to take care of your closest friends and relatives first.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>You need to pray also concerning who among the three or five companions in your group should go with you to contact your friends and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Lord will lead you.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When you go out to contact people for the first time, you should not speak to them much concerning the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If you speak too much concerning the Lord or the Bible, they may think that you are too religious.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>They may not like to be as religious as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>During the first few times of contact, you should become acquainted with them and make friends with them.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>After two or three times the Spirit may lead you by giving you the feeling that they have accepted you.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Then you can open to them something concerning the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Even at that time you should not ask them too quickly to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Wait until the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Proceed slowly, step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If after forming a group you could get one person saved within one month, how marvelous that would be.</S>
