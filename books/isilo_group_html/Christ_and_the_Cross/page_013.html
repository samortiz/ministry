<h1 class="title">CHRIST IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:9-11; 5:29-32; 1:23; 1 Cor. 12:12; Isa. 53:10; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Acts 9:3-5; Matt. 18:20; 28:20; Eph. 4:13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING GOD&rsquo;S PLAN FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:9-11 speaks of enlightening &ldquo;all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; The church was produced according to the eternal purpose and plan that God made in Christ Jesus our Lord. This means that the church was not an accident; the church came out of God&rsquo;s plan. Furthermore, the church was produced for Christ, not for any other purpose, because the church was planned by God in Christ. In eternity past, before the foundation of the world, God purposed and ordained to bring forth the church out of creation so that He might manifest His wisdom in the Son by expressing the glory and riches of Christ through the church to the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING A MYSTERY<br />
HIDDEN THROUGHOUT THE AGES</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:9 says that God&rsquo;s plan concerning the church was a mystery hidden in God throughout the ages. In eternity past God planned to gain the church for His Son. Before God created all things, He purposed to gain the church from among men for His Son. However, throughout the past ages, God did not reveal this matter to anyone. It was a mystery hidden in God and unknown to man. God did not reveal that He had created all things for the purpose of producing the church for His Son until the New Testament age (vv. 5, 9-10). Hence, the church that God wanted to obtain for His Son was His mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING BROUGHT FORTH IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>All things were created through Christ (Col. 1:16), but the church was brought forth in Christ. All things were made by Christ and are His creation (Heb. 1:10; Col. 1:16-17). The church, however, was brought forth in Christ and is a part of Christ (John 12:24; 1 Pet. 1:3), just as Eve came out of Adam and was a part of Adam, being bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh (Gen. 2:23). God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, opened his side, took a rib, and built the rib into Eve (vv. 21-22). Similarly, Christ was put to sleep on the cross, and His side was pierced to release His divine life for the producing of the church (John 19:34). Eve came out of Adam and was the overflow of Adam&rsquo;s life, and the church comes out of Christ and is the overflow of Christ&rsquo;s life (Eph. 1:23). Eve was constituted with Adam&rsquo;s life, and the church is constituted with Christ&rsquo;s life. Eve had one life with Adam, and the church has one life with Christ (Col. 3:3-4). Just as Adam could not find a helper to be his counterpart from among the animals of the field and the birds of heaven, Christ could not find a match for Himself from among the created things. Only Eve could be Adam&rsquo;s counterpart and be one flesh with him, because she came out of Adam (Gen. 2:20-24). Likewise, only the church matches Christ and is a part of Christ, because she was brought forth through Christ (Eph. 5:29-32).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING ONE WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>Just as Eve came out of Adam and was one flesh with him, the church was brought forth through Christ and is mysteriously one with Him. Adam was Adam, and Eve was also Adam because she came out of him. Similarly, Christ is Christ, and the church brought forth in Him is also Christ. Eve could be one flesh with Adam and a part of him because she came out of him. Likewise, the church can be one with Christ and a part of Him because she came out of Him. Only that which comes out of Christ can be joined to Him and be one with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ brought forth the church with His life so that the church could be His Body, making the church one with Him. This was foreordained in eternity past by God in His mysterious plan. God&rsquo;s eternal plan is to gain a group of people who have the life of Christ and who are the brothers of Christ so that they may be the Body of Christ. Individually, every believer has the life of Christ and is His brother. Corporately, we share the life of Christ and are His Body, expressing His fullness. God&rsquo;s highest goal is for Christ to obtain a Body so that His fullness would be expressed (1:23). An individual believer can express a part of Christ, but only the totality of all the believers, who possess the life of Christ in every place and throughout the ages, can fully express Christ. God has made us the Body of Christ so that Christ may gain a full expression. Although we are the many members who constitute the Body, this Body is Christ because Christ is its life, nature, constituent, and function. Hence, the church is the Body of Christ, and the church is also Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
