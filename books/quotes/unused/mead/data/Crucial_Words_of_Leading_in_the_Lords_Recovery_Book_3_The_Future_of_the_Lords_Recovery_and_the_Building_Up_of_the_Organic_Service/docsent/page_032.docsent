   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Life is another item of the treasures in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I did not place life further up on the list, because life is related to experience; it is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Life depends upon our experience; hence, we must study our experiences to see how we were regenerated, how we are being transformed, how we will mature, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot understand this point merely by studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must match what we read in the Bible with our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are willing to spend the time to study life, we will certainly be enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we contact people, we will not be short of things to say.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the contrary, the more we speak, the more we will have to say.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what is spoken of in Matthew 13:52: Every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are full of spiritual riches, they will pour out of us like rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 7:38 speaks of rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is not just one river; there are many rivers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, many rivers will flow out of our innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we would all function normally, our society and country will be greatly blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, the local churches will be brightly shining golden lampstands, preaching the gospel on the one hand and teaching the truth on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way Taiwan would not only be gospelized but also truthized.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How great a blessing this would be!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that you remember these words, because they will be your compass and your guide.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition, the Lord s recovery has a hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hymns and spiritual songs are not ordinary compositions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person s ability to compose determines his ability to write good hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must therefore pursue the knowledge of the Bible so that what you know can be composed into a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, based on an accumulation of sixty years of Bible study and on my knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, I wrote Hymns, #501.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This hymn does not only contain knowledge, but it is knowledge that produced this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>O glorious Christ, Savior mine,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thou art truly radiance divine;</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God infinite, in eternity,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet man in time, finite to be.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ, expression of God, the Great,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God mingled with humanity</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lives in me my all to be.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The parallelism in the hymn is very good God...yet man and infinite...finite.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This makes ordinary knowledge into poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fullness of God dwells in Thee;</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thou dost manifest God s glory;</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As Spirit, oneness with me sought.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All things of the Father are Thine;</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All Thou art in Spirit is mine;</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Spirit makes Thee real to me,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That Thou experienced might be.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit of life causes Thee</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By Thy Word to transfer to me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thy life in me is thus conceived.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In spirit while gazing on Thee,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a glass reflecting Thy glory,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Like to Thyself transformed I ll be,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That Thou might be expressed thru me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In no other way could we be</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sanctified and share Thy vict ry;</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus only spiritual we ll be</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And touch the life of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thy Spirit will me saturate,</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every part will God permeate,</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Deliv ring me from the old man,</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>With all saints building for His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This hymn contains the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I hope that the young brothers and sisters will all learn to write hymns, because it can raise the level of their knowledge and experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to study and to learn the truth, after which we will be able to write hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The situation in most of Christianity is that believers rely on the clergy and think that in order to serve in the church, a person must study theology and graduate with a degree to be a pastor or minister.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not our way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead, we believe that the church is the Body of Christ and that every believer as a member of the Body is able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, every one of us is a member of the priesthood 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In 1963 and 1964 with much effort I compiled a hymnal in America.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One of the hymns that was included is Drinking at the Fountain That Never Runs Dry Hymns, #322 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I admire this hymn because it speaks of human experience.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The writer thoroughly examined the experience of human life and turned human experience into a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If your grandparents, parents, or classmates have not yet believed in the Lord, you can sing this hymn to them and then, based on this hymn, preach the gospel and speak the truth to them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This hymn is excellent and very inspiring.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In addition, you can use #715 in the Chinese hymnal to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I wrote this hymn, and it is very simple, but its descriptions are very appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This hymn should be sung with expression; it should not be stiff or formal.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The first stanza says, You are fallen in a world of sin; / Why don t you repent now and escape?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>/ You are walking in the way of wickedness and snares; / Why don t you turn back before you fall into the abyss?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>And the chorus says, The Lord wants to save you!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He is waiting for you!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>/ Why don t you let Him save you today?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The entire hymn is a good gospel message with four main points: sin, Satan, death, and the Lord s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The students can sing this hymn to eight or ten of their classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After they finish singing, they can tell them, Do you not see that you are like a fish or a bird caught in a net?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You are like a patient on the operating table, allowing the surgeon, the world, to do whatever he wants.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Such a gospel will be moving.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must be inwardly filled with the truth, and we must experience the truth so that we can write hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Then our preaching of the gospel will be effective.</S>
