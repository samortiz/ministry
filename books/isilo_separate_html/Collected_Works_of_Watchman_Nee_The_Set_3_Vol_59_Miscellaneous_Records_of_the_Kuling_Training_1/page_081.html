What should a person do if his parents forbid him from going to the meetings?</p><p>Watchman Nee: We have to differentiate between submission and obedience. Submission is a matter of inward motive and attitude, while obedience is a matter of outward act and move. According to God's Word, we should be absolute and unconditional in our submission, but relative and conditional in our obedience. In Acts 5:29 Peter said, "It is necessary to obey God rather than men." If someone in authority wants us to sin, we have to be submissive in attitude but we should not obey. For example, a mother may try to force her daughter to join her in a mahjong game. It is wrong for a Christian to engage in mahjong, and the daughter must not obey her mother. Yet she should still be respectful and submissive in her attitude, and she should not be rebellious or argumentative in any way. She can lower her head and softly say, "Mother, I do want to honor your word. I wish I could obey you, but I cannot follow you in this matter because I have believed in the Lord." Submission is absolute, while obedience is relative. In Acts the Jewish Sanhedrin forbade the apostles from preaching the gospel. The apostles were submissive in their attitude, but they had to be faithful to the Lord's gospel commission, and they could not heed the prohibition of the Jewish council. However, they did not disobey in a rancorous and tumultuous way; rather, they disobeyed humbly. There should not be any malicious remark or rude expression. Once a man touches authority, he becomes soft and tender. If a man is rough and hard, it proves that he has never touched God's authority. Even when a submissive man disobeys, he disobeys meekly and tenderly. If the deputy authority is wrong, one can put off the matter of obedience, but there is still the absolute need of submission. We cannot bang the table or stomp the floor. We cannot drop our countenance or raise our voice. We cannot disobey in this way. The Bible does not allow anyone to say to his parents, "Whatever you would have been profited by me is now corban. I do not have to take care of you anymore" (Mark 7:10-12). Submission in heart, attitude, and word is absolute. We have to be firm about these three points. As long as something is not sinful, it should serve as a gateway for us to learn submission and obedience. Our submission must be absolute, while our obedience depends on the nature of the matter. Many people have a problem with obedience because they have a rebellious spirit. If we take care of our heart, our attitude, and our words, we will be proper persons.</p><p>Whenever there is a conflict between deputy authority and direct authority, we can choose to submit to the deputy authority but not to obey him. Any prohibition of God's commission, such as a ban on the preaching of the gospel, should be met with submission, not obedience. Any charge to commit God's forbidden acts, such as an enjoinment to sin, should likewise be met with submission, not obedience. We cannot revile the rulers of the state or our parents. We cannot stage revolutions or insurrections. In attitude and heart we should always be submissive. The preaching of the gospel, however, is a direct injunction of the Lord; no matter how much men oppose us, we should still persevere in it. Nebuchadnezzar commanded all men to worship his image, but God's people could not obey him even though he was the king. In all other things we should submit and obey.</p><p>Dr. F. B. Meyer once spoke of a sister who came to him, asking, "My mother takes me to many social functions. I feel that they are not profitable, and I do not like to go. I often have tried to turn down my mother's invitations, but I know I should submit to her. What should I do?" Dr. Meyer said, "You should go, but you should ask the Lord to guard your heart." When a man is taught by God, he is softened. The daughter in this case should have said to her mother, "I will go, but I would prefer that you allow me not to go." If she did not stand on the ground of submission, it would be useless even if she stayed home. Inwardly there still would not be submission in her. After the sister heard Dr. Meyer's word, she accompanied her mother to the social functions, but she was different. Before there had always been a rumbling in her heart as well as on the floor, but now there was no rumbling in her heart and no noise on the floor. She experienced more blessing by going than by staying behind. Children should always be submissive in their attitude toward their parents, but their actual conduct should be determined by the circumstance, especially when the actions are of a questionable nature. When parents force their children to go to certain places, their children may go along with much stomping and trampling. They may go in a fit of anger and return in a fit of anger. Some parents may want their children to sin, and their children may choose to stay with a rebellious attitude at home. In either case&mdash;whether or not the children go with their parents&mdash;they have gained no spiritual lesson from their action.</p><p>In the case of parents stopping their children from going to meetings, we do not have a clear-cut situation. This is a borderline case. A person's attitude to his parents in such a case should be, "I wish I could go to the meeting. If you do not allow me to go, I will submit and stay, but I hope that you will allow me to go next time." If we argue with our parents for two hours and insist on going to meetings, we are not acting in a way that is becoming as a Christian. Parents may want their children to go to places that the children do not want to go. If sin is not involved in the matter, there is not a clear decision. Submission is absolute, but obedience is another matter. If the parents insist that their children should or should not go to a certain place, the children should obey. If the parents do not insist, the children can choose. In either case, the children should be submissive in attitude. If we have this kind of attitude, God will release us in His own way.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_080.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_082.html">Next</a> </body></html>
