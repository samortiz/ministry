To Worship the Father</h2><p>The gathering for the Lord&#8217;s table is not only to remember the Lord but also to worship the Father (Matt. 26:26-30; Heb. 2:12). The gathering for the Lord&#8217;s table is a meeting for the believers&#8217; worship. According to the procedure in God&#8217;s salvation, we first receive the Lord and then draw near to the Father. Thus, in this meeting for worship, we should first remember the Lord and then worship the Father. The center of the section of the meeting on remembering the Lord is the remembrance of the Lord, and the center of the section on worshipping the Father is the worship of the Father. In this section all the prayers, hymns, and words should be directed toward the Father.<p>Matthew 26:30 says, &#8220;Having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.&#8221; This hymn was a praise to the Father by the Lord with the disciples after the Lord&#8217;s table. A principle is implied and established here, that is, after we have broken bread to remember the Lord, we ought to be led by Him to worship the Father together. Therefore, it is based upon this verse that we sing praises to the Father at the end of the Lord&#8217;s table.<p>Another verse related to the worship of the Father is Hebrews 2:12. &#8220;I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise unto You.&#8221; This verse reveals that the resurrected Christ sings hymns of praise to the Father in the midst of the church. Although the Lord Jesus is the only begotten Son of God, through death and resurrection He regenerated us who believe in Him (1 Pet. 1:3) that we might become the many sons of God. He then became the firstborn Son of God (Rom, 8:29), leading us, who are the many sons, with Him to the Father. After He was resurrected, He came among the disciples (John 20:19-29) and declared the Father&#8217;s name to His brothers. Then in His status as the firstborn Son of God, He led His many brothers, who are God&#8217;s many sons, to sing praises to the Father together, that is, to worship the Father together. According to this fact, after we have broken bread in remembrance of the Lord, we should be led by the Lord to worship the Father.<p>As we worship the Father, singing praises to Him, Christ, the firstborn Son, sings in our singing. Throughout the centuries the firstborn Son has been singing hymns of praise unto the Father in the church. He does this in all of His brothers. Because He is in us, He sings praises unto the Father in our singing. His singing is in our singing. When we sing, He sings, because He is within our singing. In this way, at the Lord&#8217;s table the firstborn Son, who dwells in His many brothers who compose the church, sings praise to the Father from within them.<p>When we gather together for the Lord&#8217;s table, we should remember to worship the Father. We should never neglect to have a time at the end of the meeting devoted to the worship of the Father. The Father surely is worthy of our worship, for He has made His Son one with us, and He has made us sons with His Son. Now the Son is taking the lead among the many brothers to worship the Father.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
