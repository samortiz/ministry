   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Being Stopped by the Unpromising Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You should not stay in any home over thirty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Set up a rule to visit at least four families when you go out for two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Going out for three hours, you must visit six families.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes we are not so wise because we got stuck with one family for the entire time and we caught nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our time was occupied with vain talk and was wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Within fifteen or twenty minutes you will realize whether or not this person is promising.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he is not, leave in a polite way and make an appointment with him for the next meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then go to the next door.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Maybe in the first hour you would knock on four doors and not one is promising.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in the second hour, you may have two doors which are very promising and you may baptize two people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that you are not stopped by the four unpromising families.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you would leave the unpromising ones and go on to knock on other doors, you will find a promising home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more doors you knock on, the more chances you would have to gain a home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Exercising Our Spirit and Faith with Boldness</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Remember to exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not just exercise your spirit at the time you talk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before you go, you have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Go to knock on doors always by exercising your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith is not in our mind; faith is in our spirit 2 Cor 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we only exercise our mind, faith is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Exercise your spirit to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Believe that the door will be opened to you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Believe that the persons will be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Believe that persons will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to exercise your spirit and faith with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Use the booklet up to a certain point; even five minutes of reading would be too much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While the person is reading, exercise your spirit to pray something from within Lord, catch this one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, touch this one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lord, open him up that I may lead him into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the Lord will answer your prayer, and this one may say, Not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is a sign that it is the time for you to take the lead to bring this person into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have to do this in boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you pray, he would not pray, yet you must exercise your boldness to say, Follow me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What I say, you say.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not ask him, but give him a kind of commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Tell him to follow you to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most people would follow you, and most people would repeat what you say in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then after the prayer, direct him to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have to exercise your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you believe, then the person you are talking to will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Too many times it was not that they would not believe, but that we would not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In my natural life, I am a timid person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is hard for me to talk to people and at a certain time to pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But I learned the lesson to exercise my spirit to talk to people and at a certain point to pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the person says that he does not know what to pray, just ask him to say what you say.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Make it so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With boldness take the lead to bring people into the spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After they pray, say, Let us be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then one of the helpers would say, This is very good!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And the young sister would go to the wife to say, Let us fill up the bathtub with water for the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible never tells us in any case that people should wait to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Saul was waiting, Ananias said, Why do you delay?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rise up and be baptized...</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Acts 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have to stand on the fact that your new contact prayed to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you would bring Him into baptism and he would call on the name of the Lord, he would complete the steps for salvation Mark 16:16; Acts 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After he is baptized, you need to go to visit him regularly so that the life within him can grow, develop, blossom, and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You may feel that this fellowship is legal, but there is even a law in maintaining our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Are you going to get air?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You need to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Breathing is very legal.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you say that you do not like this legality, this means that you do not want to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you do not want to breathe, you will expire.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What we have shared in this chapter is the way to bring people into salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is a very short way and very living.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>People will believe not because of miracles but because of touching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After a person is saved in this way, it would be very easy for us to bring him on in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you bring people in through blessings, through miracles, or through happiness, later it would be hard for you to turn them to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You would have a poor start, a wrong start.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All the elders in all the churches need to put all these points into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May all of us rise up and exercise our spirit to form the visiting teams and to practice the new way of gospel preaching.</S>
