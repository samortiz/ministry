   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THE PEACE OFFERING AND THE LORD'S TABLE Scripture Reading: Lev 7:14-21, 29-34; 1 Cor 10:16-18, 21; 5:11-13 THE NEED OF CLEANSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The peace offering always mentions the sprinkling of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have pointed out, the sprinkling of the blood in the peace offering is not within the holiest of all, but around the altar where the people enjoy and partake of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is because when we enjoy Christ, we need the sprinkling of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of Israel did not have the right to enjoy the passover lamb without the sprinkling of the blood upon the outside of the house Exo 12:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This signifies that the enjoyment of Christ is under the covering of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we come to the Lord's table, we must realize that we need the covering of His redeeming and cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have no merit to come to the Lord's table without His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By reading 1 Corinthians 10 carefully, we realize that the Apostle Paul's intention was to show us that the altar in ancient times was a type of the Lord's table in New Testament times.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The people of Israel had the altar, but today we have the table.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They had communion over the altar, and we have communion over the table.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our table is the altar, and their altar was the table.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the type of the altar, we see clearly that the blood was sprinkled around all four sides of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While they were enjoying something on the altar, they could see the sprinkling of the blood from every side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever we come to our altar, the Lord's table, to enjoy and partake of the Lord, we must realize that we need the sprinkling of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Several times the saints have asked me why I always mention the blood when I am praising the Lord around His table.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been asked this question not only in this country, but also in other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you were to ask me the same question, I would know that you do not realize the need of the cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No doubt we are already cleansed, but we still need cleansing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are still in this flesh, and our flesh is fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regardless of how good, how nice, how pure, and how clean you consider your flesh, it is still filthy and fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even if we do not have the consciousness that we are filthy, the flesh is still filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No flesh can be justified by the holy God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, whenever we come to contact the Lord, we need the cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some may say they have been victorious for many months, and during all this time they did not lose their temper once.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this, they may consider that they are very clean and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But no matter how good we think we are, we all need the cleansing of the blood for the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, whenever we come to the Lord's table, we need to apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To come to the Lord's table is absolutely different from coming to a restaurant table.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The things on the table in the restaurant are common, but the things on the Lord's table are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We, on the other hand, are so unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to contact these holy things, we need the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever we come to the Lord's table, we must apply the cleansing of the blood for the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
