 <h2 class="head1">GENUINE HELP</h2>
<p>For almost fifty years I have been serving and teaching the saints, but I am afraid that some of the help that I rendered to them was not so genuine. The genuine help, the real help, is just to get the saints into the touch with the Lord that will let the automatic law work. As the law of the Spirit of life works in such a one, it will reduce his problem and solve his problem and kill some of his germs. This is the genuine help. Sometimes a medical doctor may not give you the genuine healing, but just a kind of temporary soothing and comfort. Likewise, we sometimes feel we have received some spiritual help, but several weeks later we are still sick. The real help is to get into this touch with the Lord that will cause the automatic law of the Spirit of life to operate within us. Actually, you cannot help others. Paul planted, but he could not give life. Apollos watered, but Apollos could not give growth. Only God could give growth. I may, in certain difficult problems, help you temporarily. But only the automatic working law can kill the real source. Only the law of the Spirit of life can reduce your natural life and deal with the real germ. This is the genuine help.</p>
<p>Many times I have used a married couple as an example, saying that the wife helps the husband to grow, and the husband helps the wife to grow. But actually I doubt whether any wife has ever helped a husband to grow. At most she may help him to learn some patience. Actually, inside there is not much change. The genuine help is to bring a wife or a husband into the touch with the Lord. Then the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8 automatically works scientifically. All the negative elements and the positive elements in the law will operate. Even though we may not know so many of the things within us, when this law works within us, it reduces and eliminates. It does away with the negative things. When your wife irritates you or provokes you, you won&rsquo;t need to gnash your teeth because that ugly thing within you has been reduced and eliminated. Sometimes the reducing is not up to standard, and we need more time remaining in the touch with the Lord.</p>
<p>Through the years many so-called spiritual giants have encouraged people to contact the Lord, to fellowship with the Lord, to pray. But even they themselves didn&rsquo;t get into the principle in a thorough way. They only enjoyed the result to some extent, so they encouraged people to practice certain things and to enjoy certain things. Today we don&rsquo;t need this kind of word. We just need to come into the touch with Him. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I just come to touch You. I have nothing to ask of You. I don&rsquo;t even like to ask You to do anything for me. I just like to remain in the touch with You. I do have some burden to pray for Your recovery, for Your interest, yet I don&rsquo;t like to do it. I just like to remain in this touch.&rdquo; Your experience will confirm that if you practice this you will experience a lot of killing, a lot of reducing, a lot of strengthening, a lot of resurrecting, a lot of rising up. What is this? This is the law working in you scientifically. This law includes the weakness of the law being killed already. The impossibility of the law is done away. There is no more impossibility. Rather, it is full of possibility. The righteous requirement of the law is spontaneously fulfilled in you. It is not that you are fulfilling the requirement, but that the requirement is fulfilled in you. Furthermore, it is not just by accident and just according to mercy. It is a matter of the law. The electricity does not heat your room according to mercy, but according to law.</p>
<p>Let us come back to this automatic law that works scientifically. Dear saints, just stay in the contact with Him. Something in you will spontaneously work in a scientific way to solve this problem for you and to deal with that thing for you. Although you may not know there was such a thing in you, that thing will have been dealt with. After you have stayed in this contact for a certain period of time, you will realize experientially that within you there has been a kind of clearing up, a kind of dealing, a kind of release, a kind of rising up, a kind of soaring in the air. This is the result of the scientific working of this automatic law. This is the very God who is now indwelling you and working, not as God, but as a law. The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me.</p>
