   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fourth group of people in the Bible is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is composed of the believers; the believers are the components of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Individually, they are the believers; corporately, they are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first twenty-six books of the New Testament are concerned specifically with the church, that is, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the four Gospels also contain many references to God s chosen people, Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the four Gospels are a transitional point in the Bible, involving a shift from Israel as God s chosen people to the church, they speak about both the church and Israel, God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The main object of the four Gospels is the church, even though the background is Israel, the chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning the church, there are five main points.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A. Hearing the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first great thing in God s dealing with the church is to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church was produced through hearing the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>B. Receiving Life</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A greater part of the Gospels emphasizes hearing the gospel, but there is also a part which emphasizes receiving life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the end of the Gospels, the church has heard the gospel and received life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. Receiving the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the book of Acts, the church receives the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>D. Becoming the Dwelling Place of God,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the church has heard the gospel, received life, and received the Holy Spirit, she becomes the dwelling place of God, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To God, the church is a dwelling place; to Christ, the church is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is revealed in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>E. Being Defeated and Becoming Desolate</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the end of the Epistles, almost all of the second Epistles speak about the defeat and desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though the church has heard the gospel, received life, received the Holy Spirit, and become the dwelling place of God and the Body of Christ, she also falls into a situation of defeat and desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>V. THE WHOLE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Bible there is also a fifth section concerning man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each of the first four sections covers a single race, but the last section, Revelation, covers all of the various kinds of people together and speaks about them as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation shows us the outcome of all the people on the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians 10:32 divides the people of the world into three categories Jews, Greeks referring to the Gentiles , and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Two of these three kinds of people are descendants of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Israelites are the descendants of Abraham in the flesh; the church the believers are the heavenly descendants of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Figuratively, Abraham s descendants in the flesh, the Israelites, are like the dust of the earth, while Abraham s heavenly descendants, the church the believers , are like the stars of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When God first made a promise to Abraham, He promised two groups of descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One group became His chosen people through the flesh; the other group became His chosen people through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In addition to these two groups of chosen people, there is still another group of people on earth; they are the Gentiles, the nations, who were left from Adam through Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now let us consider these groups of people separately in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A. The Church 1.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Judging the Desolation of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The preceding section points out that the church became desolate; Revelation 2 and 3 speak of the Lord coming to judge the desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Calling the Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord calls the overcomers out of the desolate church to meet His need, as shown in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Overcomers Bringing in the Lord s Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Revelation 11 and 12 show that the overcomers in the church will conquer God s enemy and bring in the Lord s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being Raptured</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Revelation 14 speaks of the rapture of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Overcomers Reigning with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Revelation 20:4 says that the overcomers will reign with the Lord for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the Saved Ones Participating</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>in the New Jerusalem in Eternity</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Revelation 21 and 22 say that all the saved ones in the church will participate in the New Jerusalem in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In summary, Revelation speaks concerning the church in six events: judging its desolation, calling the overcomers, bringing in the Lord s kingdom, being raptured, reigning with the Lord, and all the saved ones participating in the New Jerusalem in eternity.</S>
