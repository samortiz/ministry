<p>We must realize that seeing controls our move and that this move has a direction and is also multidirectional. The book of Ezekiel shows that the Spirit determines the direction of the move of the four living creatures. All four sides of the living creatures have wheels, but the movement of the wheels is not decided by the wheels themselves. The movement of the wheels is determined by the Spirit (1:20). For this reason we need to learn to do everything. We should learn how to preach the gospel, how to edify others, and how to visit people; however, the Spirit determines the direction in which we move. Each of us should have a wheel for giving messages and a wheel for visiting people in their homes. All these wheels must be moving. Then these wheels will turn in whatever direction the Holy Spirit moves. The wheels are on four sides, but the direction is determined by the Spirit.</p>
<p>If the Spirit wants us to speak, we should not say, &ldquo;My wheel for speaking never turns.&rdquo; If we do this, we will frustrate the Holy Spirit. If the Spirit says, &ldquo;Go and speak a message,&rdquo; we should not say, &ldquo;I am used to contacting people. I am not good at giving messages.&rdquo; From Paul&rsquo;s Epistles we can see that he labored in many directions. Even within one letter he covered numerous matters. In the beginning of Ephesians 4 he spoke of keeping the oneness of the Spirit (v. 3), but toward the end of the chapter, he spoke of many details in regard to how believers should walk. The Spirit worked with him, and in him we can see many examples of moving in multiple directions and having eyes all around. Every brother and sister should have eyes all around and be able to move in four directions so that wherever the Spirit moves, we can follow. We should have wheels, and our feelings should be sharp. If our service is like this, the church will be living, and there will be rich food with which we can supply others.</p>
<p>In our service we need to learn to be keen in our perception, and we also need to have wheels on all four sides, not wheels that move in only one direction. We must have the wheel of gospel preaching, the wheel of edification, the wheel of visitation, the wheel of speaking, the wheel of not speaking, the wheel of listening, and the wheel of prayer. We must have wheels for all directions. Although the Holy Spirit may not mobilize the wheel on one side, it should always be ready.</p>
<p>Finally, all those serving in the ministry of the word must prepare living material that can meet people&rsquo;s needs. For instance, if we are giving a message on a Lord&rsquo;s Day, we must seek the Lord concerning the condition of the people to whom we will be speaking. We must find the supply that they need. If we seek the Lord in this way, the material that we prepare will be living. I do not encourage the brothers to read too many reference books. These books are precious, but they are not worth much, because they are not living. If a child is thirsty and asks for a glass of water, it is useless to put a pearl in front of him. We need to supply people according to their need. We need to spend time in the presence of the Lord in order to know the condition of the saints and to obtain words that will deal with their condition. Such words will be living; hence, we do not need to search reference materials in order to find content for a message. To do so is to have no eyes and no wheels. It is not only dead; it is also useless.</p>
<p>If we see a need, we should not feel at peace; rather, we must pick up the responsibility for the meetings in our district. We should not simply show up for the meeting on time and call a hymn occasionally. That is not to bear responsibility. We must seek what message to give in the meeting and what burden to pray for in the prayer meeting. We also need to seek how to help the saints with respect to their family situations, their physical health, and the problems related to their career. According to my observation of the church life, although there may be some visitation, no one is taking care of the work. Messages are given in the meetings, but no one is really meeting the need. Likewise, although there are responsible ones in the church, no one is taking care of the real need of the church. If a saint is sick, loses his job, or has marital problems, we should seek to shepherd him and help him. However, we are short of people taking care of these matters. Not only do we not know how to do it, no one is doing it. How can we still feel at peace?</p>
<p>Our condition can be compared to someone who has a business but has no feeling after losing money for six months. The whole church is suffering, but some of us have no feeling. Some think that since they have been assigned to be the responsible one in a certain district, if no one speaks in the meeting, they should, and if no one gives a report, they should. Even their visitation is out of obligation. When they see someone in distress, they feel obligated to help. That is all. They do not spend time in the Lord&rsquo;s presence seeking concerning people&rsquo;s situations, neither do they have a genuine concern for them. To serve out of the ordinary love that people have for one another, in the same manner as those in Protestantism or Catholicism, is not sufficient.</p>
<p>If a couple is going through a trial, we should have eyes and a sense regarding their situation. We should then activate the wheel of prayer to pray for them, seeking the Lord as to what to do. When we pray for them, the Holy Spirit will come in and lead us. Then when we visit them, we will be able to render practical help to them. Not only will they touch our love in the Lord, but they will also receive supply from our inner being and be built up. The Holy Spirit within them will bear witness to this building.</p>
<p>Some of the brothers in the various districts are in their thirties and have recently become married. These ones have a heart for the Lord, yet no one has visited them. They have not found the supply in the church to meet their need. We need some to have a feeling regarding this situation and create a &ldquo;wheel,&rdquo; seeking the Lord as to how to serve these brothers who were recently married. We do not need to ask the elders; rather, we must first have eyes. Then when the Holy Spirit moves, we will follow Him immediately and render solid help to these ones. As a result of receiving such help over a period of three to five months, these ones will never forget the leading that was rendered to them.</p>
<p>We must be alert, having many eyes, and we must have multidirectional wheels, waiting for the command of the Spirit. Such service is living. The church today needs such service. If we are this kind of a worker, no place can limit us. It will not matter whether we are in a large church or in a small district. Wherever we are, we will be able to supply the saints. Moreover, it will not matter whether the Holy Spirit leads us to speak to a big group or a small group. Today our service depends on whether or not our eyes are bright. In all these things we should learn, and we should practice. Our wheels should turn whenever the Spirit leads us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>The Ground of the Church and the Service of the Body &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
