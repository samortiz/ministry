   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to say again that I hope we would pray-read the verses in the Scripture reading.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we pray them into us, we will be able to see the proper church life with Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous chapter, we saw the main revelations which the Lord has shown us in the past fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter we want to see the practice of the church life in the Lord's recovery throughout the past fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Beginning of the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>in Brother Nee's Hometown</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The practice of the church life among us started in 1922, two years after Brother Nee was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first local church was established in his hometown, Foochow, in southern China.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He and some other young Christians saw that Christianity had deviated from God's way as revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not more than ten of them began to meet in a sister's home, but after two years, something very negative happened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The husband of this sister became a popular evangelist among the Chinese Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He met a missionary of the Christian and Missionary Alliance in Shanghai named Mr. Woodbury.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mr. Woodbury was a man of God, but he was in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He advised this brother to be formally ordained so that he could be invited by all the so-called Christian churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An appointment was made for Mr. Woodbury to come from Shanghai to Foochow to ordain this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Brother Nee found out about this, he gave a message in one of the meetings on the history of the ark in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The tabernacle with the ark was built according to God's heavenly design.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The tabernacle typifies the church, and the ark typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the children of Israel were in a normal situation, the ark was in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When they became abnormal, the ark was captured away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In that abnormal time, the ark was in one place, and the empty tabernacle was in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee was only twenty-one years old, but he could give such a message on the history of the ark, pointing out that we Christians today are in an abnormal situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the abnormal situation, God does not care for the empty tabernacle but for the ark, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Nee applied this by saying that God does not care for outward things such as being formally ordained to be a so-called minister.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Notes were taken of Brother Nee's message, and I was able to read them nine years later.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This message was very revealing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because of this message, Brother Nee was excommunicated by six brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The leading one was this brother who was the evangelist, Leland Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brother Nee related this entire story to me in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It took him hours to tell me the whole story.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of his excommunication, the meeting in Foochow became a "marsh" cf.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>47:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Nee referred to this as a halfway shelter in some of his writings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He likened such a meeting to some of the people of Israel coming out of captivity in Babylon but never returning and entering into Jerusalem, staying halfway between Babylon and Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Over ninety percent of the people who met in Foochow were converted through Brother Nee's preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many of them came to Brother Nee and told him they did not agree that he would be put out of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He told them, however, that he felt deeply that he had to learn the lesson of the cross, so he decided to leave.</S>
