   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SINGING TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because many of us were born into Christianity, raised in Christianity, and even constituted of Christianity, we must admit that, at least to some extent, we are still under the influence of the religion of Christianity, especially in the way we gather together for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nowhere in the New Testament are Christians told that we should gather together and sit quietly, waiting for someone to start the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the book of Psalms, when the children of Israel came together for the feasts three times a year, they began their meetings not in the temple, but at the foot of Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As they ascended the mountain, they psalmed the songs of ascent Psalms 120 through 134 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Likewise, the church meetings should begin not in the meeting hall, but either in our homes or on our way to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The meeting should be an exhibition of our daily life, of the way we live at home, at school, or at work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The meeting should be full of singing and praising because we sing and praise the Lord day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I appreciate the chorus of the hymn, This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But where can you find a Christian who praises the Lord all day long?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Christians who sing this hymn do not praise their Savior in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But our daily life should be filled with singing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many of us have read the Bible for years without realizing that we can receive the Word of God by singing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is it your practice to take a verse of the Bible not only by reading, but also by singing?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christians have been taught to study the Bible and to read it, but not to sing it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are thankful for the recovery of pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now we must go on to sing-read the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly in all wisdom by singing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not my teaching; it is the charge given by the apostle Paul in Colossians 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though we have been reading Colossians for years, we have not paid adequate attention to taking the Word by singing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many Christians claim to be scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But instead of being wholly scriptural, they may be formal and religious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It certainly is scriptural to sing the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should sing the Word not only in the meetings, but especially in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In particular, we should sing the Word at home.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you are alone in your room or with others at the dining table, sing the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Singing the Word is an excellent way to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To pray is to exercise the spirit, but to sing is an especially good way to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The longest book of the Bible is the book of Psalms, containing one hundred fifty psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This book was composed not merely for reading; it was written for singing, even for psalming.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Psalming is more elevated than singing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Colossians 3:16 Paul mentions psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Spiritual songs are usually short; hymns, of medium length; and psalms are usually longer compositions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to sing and psalm the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Psalming is higher, deeper, and more profound than singing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>SATURATED WITH THE WORD BY SINGING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we sincerely desire to be saturated with the living Word so that we may live Christ, we need to follow the practice advocated by Paul in Colossians 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that we must let the word of Christ inhabit us in a rich way, not by mere knowledge from the mind, but by every kind of wisdom from our spirit, including singing and psalming.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Oh, we need to sing and psalm the Word of God!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To sing the Word is better than reading it, and to psalm the Word is even better than singing it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Psalming the Word includes musing upon it and enjoying it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we psalm the Word, we dwell upon it, muse on it, and enjoy it, thereby giving more opportunity for the Word to saturate us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we only read the Word, there is little opportunity for the portion we read to sink into us and saturate our being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we sing the Word, and especially if we psalm it, we open our being more fully to the Word and give it the opportunity to sink into us and saturate us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, if we sing Psalm 1, we shall enjoy the riches found in this short psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Let us sing and psalm the Word of God not only in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let us come to the Word daily to sing and psalm it with our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In singing and psalming the Word of God, let us exercise our voice, our mind, our heart, and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, I hope that from now on in the church meetings more place will be given to spontaneous singing of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Perhaps in a certain meeting we shall sing or psalm the whole book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No doubt, if we spend an entire meeting to do this, we shall touch the riches in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is surprising that in Colossians 3:16 Paul does not mention reading.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead, he emphasizes singing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is possible to read the Word without exercising our spirit and without contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But by praying, singing, and psalming, we are ushered into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The best way to receive the word of life and to be saturated with the element of Christ is to sing the Word.</S>
