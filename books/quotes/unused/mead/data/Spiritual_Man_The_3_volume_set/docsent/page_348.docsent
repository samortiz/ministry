   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is an enormous difference between being healed by medicine and being healed by trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The power of medicine is simply natural, while the power of God is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ways to obtain these two kinds of healings are also totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The healing that comes from medicine depends on man's intelligence, while the healing that comes from trusting in God depends on the merit and life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even when a doctor, who is a believer, asks God to grant him wisdom and bless the drugs that he uses, he still cannot give the healed ones a spiritual blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unconsciously, the patient allows his heart to turn to medicine more than to the Lord's power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though his body may be healed, his spiritual life is greatly damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a believer trusts in God, he does not need medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He needs only to commit himself to God's love and power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He should examine the source of his own sickness before God and see where he has displeased God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Consequently, when he is eventually healed, he will not only derive benefit for his body but also receive blessing in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most believers regard medicine as something given by God and therefore believe that they can use it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we want to pay attention to whether one uses the medicine according to God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will not debate whether or not medicine is given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We only want to ask: is not the Lord Jesus explicitly given by God to the believers as the Savior of their sicknesses?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Should we follow unbelievers in the world or believers who are weak in faith to seek after medicine or healing by natural means, or should we receive the Lord Jesus whom God has prepared and fully trust in His name?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Trusting in medicine and accepting the life of the Lord Jesus are two completely different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We admit that medicine can cure people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The sciences of medicine and pharmacology have invented many ways and items to heal people's sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, this kind of healing is only natural, and it is not the best that God has prepared for His children.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A believer can ask God to bless the drug and still be healed; after he is healed, he can still thank God for it and consider that God has healed him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, this way of healing is not through receiving the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a sign of a believer who has left the battle of faith for convenience' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the whole goal of our struggle with Satan in sickness is to obtain a cure, any kind of healing is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we are trying to accomplish something more important than mere healing, we have no choice but to remain quietly before God and wait for His way and His time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will not adamantly say that God never blesses the use of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On many occasions God has blessed the use of medicine because He is kind and forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, these kinds of believers do not stand on the position of redemption; they simply stand on the same position as the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning the matter of sickness, they are the same as the worldly people and cannot give any testimony for God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Swallowing medicine, applying a salve, and injecting medicine cannot give us the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we trust in God, we are simply standing on a ground above the natural standing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In many cases, the healing that comes from medicine is painful and prolonged, whereas the healing that comes from God is swift and with blessing.</S>
