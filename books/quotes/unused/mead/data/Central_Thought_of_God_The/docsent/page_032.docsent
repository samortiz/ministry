   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Appearance of the City</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 18 says, "And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here jasper is mentioned again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The appearance of the city is like the shining of jasper, and the whole wall is made of jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The city itself is gold, while the wall built upon it is jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you look at the city from a distance, you do not see the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What you see is its jasper wall, for the whole appearance of the city is jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have seen, jasper stands for the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the city is in the nature of God as gold, and the wall is in the appearance of God as jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The young people who are believers in Christ have God within them as the divine nature, the new nature, signified by the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am sure that they have the divine gold within them, but I am afraid that many are barren gold with little of the shining jasper as the appearance of God built upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have the gold, the divine nature of God, within them by regeneration, because when we are regenerated, we receive God as the golden nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, after regeneration we need to be built up by transformation to have something of the appearance of God shining as jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you go to certain churches, you can realize that there is something built up that is shining all the time, something that is always attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The whole wall of the city is jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means the whole appearance of the city bears the appearance, the likeness, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God appears as jasper, and this city also appears as jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So, this city has the appearance, the likeness, of God expressed through her.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Precious Stones in the Foundations of the Wall</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 19-20 say, "The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The entire wall is jasper with twelve foundations, and all twelve foundations are precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first stone of the foundation is jasper, which is the same as the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we consider carefully, we can see that the twelve stones are laid upon each other in layers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The twelve layers of precious stones as the foundation in their respective colors have the appearance of a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 3 of chapter four says, "He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appearance."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The appearance of God in the universe is that of jasper with a rainbow around Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the New Jerusalem comes, there is the same picture a city of jasper with a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Its appearance is exactly the same as the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The spiritual meaning of a rainbow is seen in Genesis 9:13-17, which says, "I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The rainbow is a token of the everlasting covenant that God will never destroy His living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the rainbow is a sign of God being the God of covenant, the God of faithfulness, who is faithful to keep the everlasting covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That the foundation of this city is a rainbow means that the city is built upon the faithfulness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a city that can never be destroyed because it is a city of the everlasting covenant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The New Jerusalem is a city which has the foundations Heb 11:10 , and the foundations are the faithfulness of God, the everlasting covenant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The foundation of this city is like a rainbow which reminds us and God that we are safe, that we have eternal security.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The city in which we will dwell is a city with a rainbow as the foundation to remind God that it is not lawful for Him to destroy it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is not allowed to destroy it, and He is bound by His everlasting covenant not to destroy it.</S>
