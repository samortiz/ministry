<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING GOSPEL VISITATION</h2><p>Gospel visitation is also an important work of the church. We have to pay attention to a number of points: How do we knock on others' doors? What should be our attitude when we meet others? How should we conduct ourselves in our speaking? How should we respond to different kinds of people? How should we respond when we have the answer, and how should we respond when we do not have the answer? What should our manner be? How long should we stay in someone's home? (It should be half an hour at the most.) The responsible brothers have to consider these things. When we meet the gospel friends, we can say, "I am coming to you on behalf of the church; the church cares for you and has heard that you have believed in the Lord Jesus. We are very happy about it. The church has sent me to visit you." The visiting ones do not necessarily have to pass on any teaching; they can simply give their own testimonies. If the friends have some problems, there is no need to answer everything. Just say, "I myself have believed in the Lord for only two months. I am also a learner." If many people can rise up to do this work, there will be less idle ones in the church (cf. Matt. 20:1-10).</p><p>For visitation, there is the need of training. The trainers and the leaders must pray and consider much. Before assigning brothers and sisters to the visitation work, they should seek the Lord. They should know how to lead the saints in this work. When they encounter difficulties, they should fellowship, pray, and seek solutions. The same is true with the overseers. If the visitation work is done in a hurry and if the visitors are not exercised before the Lord, it will be easy to offend others. It may even cause problems. However, if it is conducted in a careful way, everything will be covered adequately.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD OF EXHORTATION</h2><p>The brothers have to bear responsibility for carrying out the above points. You have to consider much before the Lord and pray much before making any assignment. You have to be strict before the Lord. If you are strict, you will not be careless. You have to present all the things before the Lord one by one. If you want to work at all, you have to work properly, systematically, and in a dedicated way. Do not be loose. Do not think that any way is just as good as another as long as it is done by the spirit. This is wrong. In addition to exercising your spirit, you have to work according to the right principles. The most important principle in the work is not being slothful in zeal. Those who are slothful will not accomplish anything. I hope that none of you will be slothful. If God grants mercy and adds more people, you will feel that twenty-four hours are not enough to do your work.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETINGS FOR BUSINESS AFFAIRS</h2><p>Every week you have to schedule a meeting for business affairs. This meeting is harder to conduct than a message meeting. Sometimes one does not know how he can release his burden through the fellowship. If the burden remains locked up inside, it becomes a condemnation to the conscience. If there are too many affairs to take care of in such a meeting, the burden becomes correspondingly heavy. For this reason you have to come together to pray first. You have to open up your spirit to cast your care on God. Your spirit has to be unfettered. Then you must consider carefully and think through everything before God before discussing it. The meeting for business affairs should be separated from the meeting for Bible study. Do not mix the two things together. They must be separate. Do everything with a single heart. A man is limited in his mental capacity. Even the combined effort and energy of a few people are limited. This is the reason you must work with singleness of heart. You must study the Bible with singleness of heart, and you must fellowship about business affairs with singleness of heart. If you mix these two things together, you will accomplish nothing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEETING FOR EVANGELISTS</h2><p>In addition to these meetings, there is sometimes the need to have a meeting for evangelists. Before and after every such gospel meeting, there is the need of thorough prayer, fellowship, and evaluation. If you do this, the church will become powerful in the gospel.</p>
