<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: You have encouraged us to walk according to the spirit and not to rely on the exercise of the spirit in the meetings. If we leading brothers are led by the Lord to change the meeting environment, how should we help the saints who want to continue in the old way?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The basic principle is that we should not make anything a legality. If we decide to give up the old way and force our decision on the church, this is legality. When we first began to the call on the name of the Lord and pray-read in the meetings in the 1960s, I often felt that the calling and the pray-reading were somewhat wild, but I did not say much to correct the situation. Recently, I did not feel good about the shouting of some young brothers in the meetings because I did not believe that their shouting was of the spirit, but I did not say anything. In principle, we must help the saints to know the real exercise of the spirit, which is not merely shouting or excitement. Recently, some young brothers laughed wildly in a meeting. I do not believe that it was the release of the spirit, and I do not believe that it edified others. The elders should adjust such ones in fellowship not during the meeting but afterward. Otherwise, the elders are being negligent. We would not be wild or loose if the president were among us. Therefore, we certainly should not be this way in the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>The elders should care for the saints as children in their family. When some of the children do not behave, the elders need to do something. The elders should not expect that a traveling co-worker would do something to correct a situation. The church is under the care of the eldership. The elders have many responsibilities, just as parents must do many things to raise their children. Regrettably, I have noticed that some elders do not do their duty. In every meeting the elders should be watchful. The elders are overseers of the church (Acts 20:28, 17). As overseers, they should exercise oversight.</p>
<p>The elders should not try to force the saints in their localities to stop the so-called old way. That is legality. Instead, the elders need to pray much and do their best to help the saints learn the real exercise and release of spirit. A saint may call on the Lord loudly in order to be released from some bondage. That is genuine and is not a performance. We all need to exercise and release the spirit, call on the name of the Lord, and pray-read in the meetings. However, we should not be unruly. We should not be a &ldquo;pray-reading church,&rdquo; neither should we be a &ldquo;non-pray-reading church.&rdquo; Both are wrong and are matters of religion. We should not make anything a legality. We like to have things clear-cut and make regulations. However, according to the New Testament, the church is absolutely a matter of the spirit and life. It should have no legal regulations or bondage. A local church is simply the saints in a locality meeting together. It does not need to have official membership or a record of its members. Whoever believes in the Lord Jesus is a member of the local church wherever they are.</p>
<p><em>Question: First Peter 5:3 says that the elders should be patterns of the flock. Can you share more about what the elders should do to become such patterns?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The elders in each locality should fellowship concerning what needs to be done. There is much for the elders to do. Those who only come to the meetings and do routine work need to begin to do something more. Every elder can begin by praying to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. The Lord may lead the elders to contact every saint in their locality. They may contact the saints in different ways&mdash;one at a time or in small groups, by visiting them or inviting them somewhere. If the elders begin to contact all the saints, they will stir up the practical shepherding in the church. First, the elders will shepherd the saints; then the saints will begin to shepherd others. This is the way for the elders to be a pattern to the flock. They are the first sheep to do something, and the rest of the flock will follow them to do what they are doing.</p>
<p>We are always short of shepherding. There is also a great need for gospel preaching. This is not simply a matter of announcing a love feast and a gospel meeting. We know from experience that this alone does not work. Once we have laid a foundation, then we can use this way. A love feast for the gospel is the drawing in of a fishing net. First, we must cast the net. If only a few new ones come to a love feast for the gospel, it is difficult to give a gospel message with impact.</p>
<p>There are many things for the elders to do&mdash;it all depends upon their seeking the Lord&rsquo;s leading and carrying it out properly. However, as the elders work, they should pass things on to others. The more we do, the less there should be in our hand. After we finish doing something, there should be nothing left in our hand. Every burden should go to others. We need to include others in everything we do in order to pass the burden on to them. From the very beginning, whatever we do should lay the foundation to pass the burden on to others. After a year of laboring on something, no burden should remain with us. Every bit of the burden should be on others&rsquo; shoulders. If we practice in this way, a revival will come in which every member will be functioning and active in the church life.</p>
