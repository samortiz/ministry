   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SHANGHAI MESSAGES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF 1940 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THE ATTACK ON THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Acts 2:26-27, 31; 1 Cor 15:55; Rev 1:18; 20:13-14; Isa 38:9-11, 18; Eph 1:23; Col 2:9; Rom 8:10; 1 Cor 2:14 THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A VESSEL OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ was living on earth, He was a vessel for the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was God's expression and image.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Colossians 2:9 says that in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is invisible, and He dwells in unapproachable light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, He has deposited all His riches into Christ and has made Christ a visible man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ dwelt among men and manifested God's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then one day Christ put all His riches into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His intention is for the church to express His riches and be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, the church in turn becomes the vessel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the riches of God are in Christ, and today all the riches of Christ are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to Ephesians 1:23, the church is "the fullness of the One who fills all in all."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is not a refugee camp filled with poor and pitiful people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is filled with people who have the riches of Christ and who are the vessels of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why does the church exist on the earth today?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church exists to be a testimony of the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The riches of God are in Christ, and the riches of Christ are manifested through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How does the church express Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since the church is the testimony of the riches of God, its characteristics must be the characteristics of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then what are the characteristics of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can put it in a simple way: The characteristics of Christ are encapsulated in the words He said when He raised Lazarus from the dead, "I am the resurrection and the life" John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the church is the vessel of Christ on earth, it should express this life and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God intends for the church to manifest the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the church must be full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the church everything that issues from God is life, and everything that issues from Satan is death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The main goal of the Lord coming to earth is for man to have life John 10:10 , that is, for man to receive God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Gospel of John is a book on life; it is not on sin or other things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Almost every chapter concerns life and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's Christ is life, and God's Christ is resurrection, and the church is the vessel of this life and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We know that a vessel is used to contain things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You cannot give water to others with your hands; you have to have a vessel to contain the water before others can receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through the church the vessel of Christ God dispenses His life and riches to men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>SATAN'S ATTACK ON THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan is God's rival.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He attacks everything that God wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since God's goal today is the church, Satan's attacks are directed specifically against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan does not necessarily stumble Christians or the church with the enticement of sin or the world, because these things are too obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While we may be free from sin and not love the world, we can still be under Satan's attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A bottle with a five-inch mouth cannot be stopped with a one-inch cork.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Dealing with sin and the world alone is not enough to stop the attacks of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The ultimate weapon Satan uses to attack the church is death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Death is not easily identifiable; it can creep secretly into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This does not mean that Satan will not use the world and sin to attack the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It means that Satan can use refined and moral things, not just filthy and treacherous sins to attack Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many refined and moral things are filled with death, and Satan can easily utilize these deadly things to attack the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Matthew 16:18 says that the foundation of the Lord's church is Christ the Rock, and the gates of Hades cannot prevail against this church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hades is death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the church has its roots in heaven, it will be impossible to cut it off from heaven, because like a great heavenly banyan tree, its roots are entrenched and death cannot prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only reason that death cannot prevail over the church is that the church is built upon Christ the Rock.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Isaiah 38 mentions Hezekiah's illness and his recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It shows us that Satan is most afraid when a godly man defies death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many Christians can tell the difference between hot and cold; they know whether or not a sermon is well-delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But it is hard for them to distinguish between death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if the church is built on Christ the Rock, it will distinguish between death and life, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Romans 8:10 corresponds with John 12:25.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Romans 8:10 is on the body and the spirit, while John 12 is on the soul, both the preserving and the losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In both cases the end result is related to death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everything that issues from the body or from the soul results in death, which is Hades, whereas everything that issues from the spirit results in life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A man may be very talkative; he may be very wordy and may love to speak vain and improper words.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A man also may be clear in logic and excellent in eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All these things are but the products of the flesh, the soul, and the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>None of them is of the spirit or of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, there is no life; there is only death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A Christian should not ask whether a thing is good or evil but should ask from where a thing originates.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Does it originate from the natural life, the flesh, the soul, or does it originate from the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Of all the things that a Christian possesses, only those that originate from the spirit are of life, and only they can give others life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nothing else no matter how good, profitable, or nice gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Soon after I was saved, I became very interested in Bible exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I studied the different ways to outline the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I studied the different ways to quote Scriptures and use parables.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When I listened to others' messages, I would criticize them and label them good or bad, right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I tried to collect more material from others so that I could be as good as they were.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even in listening to Miss Barber, I held the same attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many times I did not appreciate the messages of others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At that time I could not tell the difference between life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I thought that the most important thing was logic and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After listening to Miss Barber for two years, I was invited once by her to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>She wanted to see how well I spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I did my best to prepare for it; I felt good about my own speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The ideas were clear, the logic lucid, the explanations thorough, and the examples appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After I delivered my message, I thought she would surely commend me a little.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But she did not say a word and acted as if nothing had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I said in my heart, "Even if the message was not good, you should say something about it."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But she simply did not mention it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>One day, as I was walking with her in the courtyard, she turned to me and said, "If you realize someday that ideas alone are not good enough, it will be a wonderful day."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I was puzzled by what she said, and I did not appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I said in my heart, "Didn't you use illustrations and quote Scriptures in your sermons?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>What is the difference?"</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>At that time I did not understand what she meant, but today I do.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There was life in her messages, but there were only ideas without life in my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Her words caused others to touch life, while my words only caused others to touch knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Once I invited a doctor of theology to Miss Barber's meeting and asked that he be given the opportunity to speak, and I translated for him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>After the message I asked Miss Barber, "How was it?"</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>She said, "It was sad!"</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I asked her why, and she pointed to a door that was chained shut and said, "Something good, but not moving."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I was again upset by her remark.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I told another brother, "This man has spoken only once.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Can she possibly know all about him?"</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But today I know what she was talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Everything depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If there is no life, all we have is death.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The church does not need good doctrines, good theology, or wonderful expositions.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The church needs life, the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>No doctrine, idea, theology, or exposition can replace the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Only the life of Christ and that which issues from it will prevail against the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Everything else is just disguised forms of death and cannot withstand the attacks of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>May the Lord be merciful to us, and may He keep us from touching death or bringing death into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>May God fill the church with life, and may Satan find no opening to attack the church.</S>
