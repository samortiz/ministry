THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING ACCORDING TO LIFE</h2>
<p>The organization of the church is a matter of growth. Whether we speak of the church as the Body or as a house, both are the issue of growth. This is because the organization of the Body is of life, and the organization of the church as a house is also of life. As a house, it is the growing together of living stones. The church is not without organization. It absolutely has organization, but its organization is of life. We cannot study this matter according to reason; rather, we need to prove and test it according to life.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that a brother becomes an elder. His being an elder is definitely something related to organization; otherwise, it would be unlawful and illegal. The raising up and the appointment of an elder in the church is a matter of spiritual organization. If a brother becomes an elder but cannot supply life to others nor receive the life supply from others, his being an elder is merely a matter of man-made organization. However, if his being an elder is an issue of the growth in life, he will be able to supply life to others and also receive the supply of life from others. Hence, the organizational fact related to his being an elder is based on the inward reality of life. Based simply on outward appearance, it is inaccurate to say that having elders is organizational and that such organization is wrong.</p>
<p>In the past, among the churches in different places in mainland China, some elders were elders purely in an organizational sense. Whenever we thought of their serving as elders, we had an inward sense of death. Whenever we observed them handling church affairs, we sensed death. With them there was no supply of life. Their being made elders was purely a matter of outward organization. In principle this was Catholicism and Protestantism. It was not the work of the Holy Spirit. An elder who is an elder among the saints according to the arrangement of the Holy Spirit will produce in people a sense of life. They will sense life in his person and in his carrying out of his office, that is, in the carrying out of his duty and position as an elder. If an elder is merely an elder according to an outward arrangement in the way of organization and not as the result of growth in life, he himself will sense that there is no life in his eldership. He will sense that his eldership is dead, not living.</p>
<p>The church is not without organization. On the contrary, the church has organization, yet this organization is of life. The organization of the church is of life just as the organization of a body is of life. The church is an organism. All those who work for the Lord need to be careful. They should not think that they can appoint elders, deacons, and other serving ones merely according to the Bible. This matter is not so simple. In principle, one who is sent by the Lord for His work is an apostle, and as such, he may appoint elders in the churches. However, if the appointment of elders is based merely on this principle, it will be only a matter of human organization carried out according to dead regulations and in letter. It will be no different from the dead situation found in Protestantism. All those who work for the Lord must seek the Lord cautiously and seriously in regard to their appointing of elders and choosing of deacons. They need to ask, &ldquo;Will this brother be an elder who will be able to supply life to the saints? Will he be able to dispense life to the church? Moreover, will he be able to receive the supply of life from the church?&rdquo; This is an accurate test.</p>
<p>Every elder must also examine himself before God in a serious way. He must ask, &ldquo;Today, am I, as an elder serving and administrating in the church, able to touch the life supply? Am I able to render a life supply?&rdquo; If an elder&rsquo;s answer to these questions is in the negative, he is in the wrong position. If a member of a body is in the proper position, there will be the circulation of blood within him, and he will be able to supply blood to others and receive a supply of blood from others. We can be clear regarding whether our position is proper or not, based upon whether our inner being is living and has the sense of being alive.</p>
<p>There should be no competition in the matter of service. For example, a brother may have been saved for fifteen years, whereas another brother, who has an important position in the church, may have been saved for only fourteen years. The brother who was saved a year earlier should not expect to be in the same position simply because he has been saved longer. This is not proper.</p>
<p>We must know that our place in the church is something of life and is an issue of the growth in life. If we try to compete with others and seek to be in their position, the result will be death. For example, if a brother stands up to speak and does not keep his place in his speaking, those listening to him will feel uneasy and uncomfortable within, even though they cannot explain why. This is because his speaking is not according to the Spirit. This situation produces death, not life, and it is not the issue of the growth in life.</p>
<p>Is a certain arrangement in the service proper? Should certain ones serve as deacons? Should a certain brother be responsible to take the lead in a service? All these questions cannot be determined outwardly but must pass through a strict test. Being an elder, a deacon, or a responsible one for a home meeting or a small group is a matter that should be tested before God. Competition or comparison with others does not matter. The only way is to submit under the Head. This is the way to receive mercy and grace.</p>
<p>If a brother is appointed to be an elder or a deacon, our response should be to tell the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, praise You for appointing and using my brother. Even though he is younger than I, even though I have been saved for ten years and he for only four years, I worship You. You are the Head. I am a member.&rdquo; This is the way to be blessed. In the church we should not make comparisons or engage in competition. It is God who appoints, and it is Christ who builds. All the matters in the church are of life and are not controlled by human hands.</p>
<p>Anything that is of life is beyond human manipulation. If there is really life, there is life. If there is no life, there simply is no life. If the activities of the saints in their service in the church are in life, everyone will sense it; however, if their service is not carried out in life, everyone will also sense this. Not only will everyone else sense it, but even the ones not serving in life will sense it. The saints can sense whether they are serving in life or in competition with others.</p>
<p>If the children of God do not serve and coordinate in life, they will compare, and even more seriously, they will compete. God&rsquo;s children should not neglect life, simply because the church has organization. Once they neglect life, the church will no longer be an organism. It will be a dead entity. This is terrible. Those of us who work for the Lord should be careful; we must not stretch out our hands to appoint people in a careless manner. We cannot and should not do this. Let us suppose that a co-worker says, &ldquo;I am a worker; why can I not appoint elders?&rdquo; Such a word demonstrates that he is not qualified to appoint elders. His word is a proof that he is not in life. Being an elder is a matter of growth in life, and even the appointment of elders has to be of life. Not only in the appointing of elders, but even in the appointing of deacons and those responsible for small groups, the brothers need to be careful to always check whether or not they are touching life or touching death and whether their appointment is of life or merely of organization. This is a solemn matter.</p>
<p>We should have coordination and arrangement among us; that is, we should have organization. However, what we have should not be mere coordination, arrangement, or organization. It should be the issue of growth in life. When we appoint elders and deacons, we should bow our heads and worship the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, there are a few brothers in the church who have grown. It is Your abundant life that has produced these elders and deacons. Lord, we worship You.&rdquo; How sweet this is!</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, those who cannot and do not know how to touch the sense of life are not qualified nor worthy to appoint elders. It is dangerous if they do so; hence, they should never attempt to touch this matter. We should never think that we are the one to take care of a messy situation simply because no one else is taking care of it. We must know that unless it is of life, our taking care of such a situation will be similar to Uzzah and the Ark of God in 2 Samuel 6:1-7. The result will be death. The important matter is not whether the condition is messy, but whether we have touched life inwardly in our service, arrangement, and coordination. We must use life as the test. The church definitely has coordination, arrangement, and organization, but all these matters must be in life.</p>
