   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MUTUAL TRUST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Lord's recovery today we need to have a mutual trust.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all must believe one another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You must believe me, and I must believe you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If one of the churches is cautious about the other churches, that church is abnormal and unhealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the past, I was greatly influenced by the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every one among them was an expert at being cautious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Brethren were afraid that someone would desire to be a pope.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some of the brothers who feared that others might become a pope might have been the ones most ambitious to become a pope.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all need to receive mercy to drop this concept of a pope, a concept that may cause us to be sectarian, even in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need to be concerned about someone becoming a pope.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, let us take care of our spirit and be concerned with how much we release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is just one Body in the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the churches must be one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But I do not mean that they should be organized to be one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the church in Cleveland is afraid of being touched by the church in New York, I would wonder what kind of church there is in Cleveland.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It would certainly be abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I am afraid that the person sitting next to me will steal my watch, I must have some kind of problem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I encourage you all to be at peace and to open your church to the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not keep the church in your pocket as a pocket version of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is of Christ, of God, and of the saints Rom 16:16; 1 Cor 11:16; 14:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not a church of you or me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, some desire to turn the church into a pocket church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past I saw this a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In every instance those who tried this failed, for the saints would not agree with such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every saint desires to be in a church that is an open church, a church that is of God, of Christ, and of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every local church must be open.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not keep the church in secret.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, keep it open and welcome all the saints who visit you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they visit you, bring them into the inner chamber.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not sufficient even to bring them into the living room; you must also bring them into the secret chamber.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I can boast for the brothers in Anaheim that nothing there is kept secret.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you come to Anaheim, you will find that everything from the skin to the innermost being of the church is open to you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nothing is in our pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am familiar with the diseases in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I know the damage caused by the hidden germs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this reason, I have been burdened to pass on this healing word to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only the elders, but also all the young ones, should be clear that the Lord's recovery is to bring us back to one Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not have organization or division; and we do not have confusion, control, or a pocket version of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the churches must be open, and all must be one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But there is no organization, no confusion, and no control.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, there is one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, no one should keep the church in his pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the contrary, everything must be public, everything must be for the saints, everything must be in the Spirit, and everything must be for the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Remember, the Lord's recovery is to bring us back to the one Body with the one Spirit.</S>
