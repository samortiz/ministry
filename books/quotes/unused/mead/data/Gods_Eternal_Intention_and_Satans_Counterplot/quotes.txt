[2]  CHAPTER ONE GOD'S ETERNAL INTENTION AND SATAN'S COUNTERPLOT Scripture Reading: John 1:12-13; 14:16-17, 20, 23; 15:5b; Rom 8:9-11; 1 Cor 6:17; Eph 3:17a, 19b; 4:6; 1 John 4:13; 3:10a; Eph 2:2; John 8:44; Matt 16:23
[3]  "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death" Rom 8:2 .
[4]  If we go back to Romans 7, we shall find two other laws, the law of good in the mind v. 23 and the law of God v. 25 . Both the law of the Spirit of life and the law of sin and of death are mysterious.
[5]  The ordinances are like small commandments; they with the Ten Commandments, which are the principles of God's law, comprise what is called the law, not the law of nature, but the law of commandments.
[6]  Then, when our mother asked if we had taken any, we quickly answered no. Was there a commandment, telling us to say no to our mother? We had no commandment; we were acting according to the law of evil within us.
[7]  Every kind of life is not only governed by a law; every life is a law.
[8]  The apple life is a law; the peach life is also a law.
[9]  There are many different beings in the universe, but only three are vital.
[10]  We may have read the great philosophers' writings, but if we do not know the Bible, we still do not know what man is.
[11]  We do not know where we came from nor where we are going; we do not know where we are; we do not know what human life is; and we do not know the purpose of human life.
[12]  John 14 tells us that the Spirit of reality is coming, not only to be with us but to be in us vv.
[13]  In that day, that is, the day of resurrection, "you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" v. 20 . Here is mingling.
[14]  That we can abide in Christ and have Him abide in us indicates that we and He, the very God, are one.
[15]  But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you."
[16]  "Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit" 1 John 4:13 .
[17]  The Spirit is the consummate manifestation of the Triune God.
[18]  This God who has been processed and is now the Spirit dwelling in our spirit is the law of the Spirit of life.
[19]  CHAPTER TWO THE TWO TREES IN GENESIS AND THE TWO LAWS IN ROMANS Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-9, 16-17; Rom 7:21-25a; 8:1-2
[20]  There are many things on this globe which people treasure.
[21]  Without Christ we do not know where God is; He cannot be traced.
[22]  We have a new message, vital though unusual, on the two trees in Genesis and the two laws in Romans.
[23]  One of these items, the Bible, God's Word, tells us that God created man, another item, in a particular way.
[24]  Romans 11 tells us that we believers in Christ have been grafted into God.
[25]  Then God took this man whom He had created and set him before two trees.
[26]  I would have thought God would take Adam and talk with him in lecture after lecture, training him in how to behave.
[27]  If Genesis 2 had been written like this, I surely would have thought it was a wonderful chapter of the Holy Scriptures, written by God.
[28]  May God be merciful to you and grace you, that you may grow together with Him and that He may grow together with you!
[29]  Before the tree of life got into man, the second tree entered into him.
[30]  It may seem so to us, but God waited.
[31]  CHAPTER THREE THE WAR AGAINST THE LAW OF GOOD IN OUR MIND BY THE LAW OF SIN IN OUR MEMBERS AND THE FREEDOM FROM THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH BY THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 7:17-24; 8:1-6, 13, 14-16, 23 THE CONFLICT IN MAN
[32]  In human beings there is a law of trying to do good.
[33]  There is a war going on against this law by the law of sin.
[34]  Then I read verse 2 to them: "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death."
[35]  It was left to Paul, and Paul alone, to tell us that the church is the Body of Christ; that Christ is the mystery of God Col 2:2 ; that the church is the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4-6 ; and that Christ lives in us Gal 2:20 .
[36]  For, the law being impossible in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit."
[37]  After reading this message, will you pray like this?
