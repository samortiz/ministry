<P>Many years ago our brother, Watchman Nee, saw this clearly. I surely knew where he was. He had many talks with me. Actually, I learned these things through him. Since the time that Brother Nee shared these things, however, the Lord's recovery has gradually and unintentionally drifted back in certain respects to the practice of Christianity. It seems that hierarchy, organization, and clergy, in principle, have begun to exist among us secretly. The way to uproot hierarchy, organization, and clergy is to fully abandon the practice of Christianity.</P><P>I think that the leading ones in all the different localities should have realized that the real situation among us has drifted back, to some extent, from the living Body of Christ to hierarchy, organization, and clergy. The way to pull down hierarchy, organization, and clergy is to kill the system of having big meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. Then there will be no means to build up hierarchy. If we pull down this old system of meeting and meet according to homes, hierarchy will be gone.</P><P>Some may argue by saying that if we have many home meetings, the church will be full of confusion. My response is that it all depends upon how we have the home meetings. The Bible shows us that the home meetings are not for doctrines or organization, but for preaching Christ and teaching Christ. The pattern in the New Testament reveals that in the home meetings they remembered the Lord by breaking bread, they preached Christ, and they taught what Christ did and is still doing. They ministered Christ to people. If we do this, there will be no standing and no ground for the enemy to come in to cause confusion.</P><P>In order to fully enter into the scriptural practice of the church life, the way ahead of us is very long. We are acquainted with the way to hold big meetings. We were raised up in this way, and this way has become a part of the "tissue" and the "cells" of our being. It is somewhat easy for people to establish a so-called church. They can build or rent a place to meet, collect some people together, raise funds, and hire someone to speak to them. But we must labor to learn the God-ordained, scriptural way to practice the church life because it is really new to us.</P>
