   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings to the brothers and sisters who inherit grace with us:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every time we receive The Open Door, we praise God unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord began to work in San-Ban-Gang three years ago.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We still must ask the Lord to work and lead us all forward until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Peace.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank God for constantly gracing us during the six months we lived as refugees.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He always covers us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I think that Brothers Chou Hsing-yi, Tang Shou-ling, and Chou Fu-en and their wives have already told you about our condition in detail, so I will not say too much.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We especially thank God that we suffered no loss through hardships, even though our houses in San-Chiao-Bu were burned and we were robbed twice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can even say that we did not feel frightened by all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The meetings of the brothers and sisters have never stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that God's grace will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I really am thankful for the prayers of the brothers and sisters in Shanghai and every other place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before the Lord we often remember the brothers and sisters that have met with similar hardships.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can only feel for them and respond to their needs in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have written these few lines hastily because someone is going to Shanghai, and I wanted to greet you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I really think of Brother Stephen Kaung.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please greet him for me.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I received Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1 5 of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord's light really shined into my heart.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We thank the Lord even more that through this printed communication, the brothers and sisters are able to fellowship with each other during this time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We truly admire the saints' heart for the Lord and feel ashamed for ourselves at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is not a meeting in Gao-Mi that is truly according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On March 2 Brother Chang Tze-jieh was led by the Lord to meet in Gao-Mi for seven days.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We really need to wait before the Lord to deal with everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must know His heart's desire, seek His will, and wait for His arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Please pray for us and ask God to establish our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May God gain us more.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Your little brothers in the Lord,</S>
