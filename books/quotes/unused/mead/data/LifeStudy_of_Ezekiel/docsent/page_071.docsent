   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Showers of Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord promises that there will be showers of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There will be no lack of water, for there will be not only rivers but also showers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times in the meetings of the local churches we sense that something is not only flowing but also coming down like a shower.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes even at home after the meeting, we have the sense that the showers of blessing are still coming down upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the strongest sign that the Lord s blessing is upon the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He sends us showers of blessing in season, so timely.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Tree of the Field Yielding Its Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and the Earth Yielding Its Increase</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 27 tells us that the tree of the field will yield its fruit and that the earth will yield its increase.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The showers will cause the trees to yield their fruit and cause the earth to yield its rich produce.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that there will be an abundance of spiritual food not only for us to enjoy ourselves but also for us to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the local churches are rich with spiritual food, in the Lord s recovery there is no more famine, no shortage of food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the start of a meeting, we may seem to have only five small loaves, but after the meeting we have twelve full baskets left over.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a real blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus far we have seen that there are three signs that the local churches are under the Lord s blessing: the showers in season, the trees yielding fruit, and the abundance of produce from the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should never have the sense that the local church meetings are short of food.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are short of food, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we in the Lord s recovery are under His blessing, we will be rich in food.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Being a Plant of Renown</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ezekiel 34:29a says, I will raise up for them a plant of renown.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here the Lord promised to raise up a plant of renown, whose fruit would be for the enjoyment of His recovered people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once again, this plant is Christ as the rich food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whatever needs we may have and whatever difficulties we may face, He will give us the rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No Longer Being Consumed</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>with Hunger in the Land</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Finally, verse 29b says, They shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead of spiritual famine, there will be a rich food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God Being Their God, and They Being His People</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verses 30 and 31 conclude, Thus shall they know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here the Lord promised that He would be with them, that they would be His people, and that He would be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They have God s presence, God is among them, and they are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the perfect fellowship with God, the fellowship in oneness the genuine recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Lord s recovery we have God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are His people, and He is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are His and He is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have such a fellowship, such a oneness, for we are one with God, and God is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the recovery of the church life the real mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From this we see that the recovery of the church life is not a matter of teachings or gifts but a matter of the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are here on earth enjoying such a oneness and mingling with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the Lord s recovery by life.</S>
