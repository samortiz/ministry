   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Obeying the teaching of the anointing is the crucial and central experience of our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This lesson is related to all the dealings we experience on the negative side and the building up on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, our obedience to the anointing is the secret of our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we desire to follow the Lord in the way of life, we should have a thorough knowledge and experience of this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. THE MEANING OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the meaning of the anointing?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can understand this by the term itself and by its origin in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Firstly, let us look at the meaning of the term itself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The anointing of 1 John 2:27 in the original Greek is not a noun, but a verb pertaining to a certain kind of motion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not an ointment in a quiescent state, inactive and motionless, but it is an ointment in a state of motion and activity, involving the movement of anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then what does the anointing refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All Bible students agree that the anointing refers to the moving of the Holy Spirit, and that the ointment in the Old Testament is a type of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. The Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who is the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people misunderstand the Holy Spirit as a power or a thing given by God to do supernatural or sometimes spooky things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No. The Holy Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The eternal God is embodied in the eternal Word John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This eternal Word is God who became flesh and was called Christ Jesus John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This complete God as a genuine man lived a perfect human life 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He went to the cross to remove all the negative things in the universe Heb 2:14 and to release His life to all His chosen and redeemed people John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , that is, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore when we talk about the Holy Spirit, we are talking about the Triune God Father, Son and Spirit who went through a process to consummate in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>B. The Old Testament Type</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This Holy Spirit is typified by the compound ointment in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Exodus 30:23-25 describes how the compound ointment is made.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This ointment is made of four spices myrrh, cinnamon, calamus and cassia added to a hin of olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Myrrh is a sweet spice used for burials, so it typifies the Lord's sweet death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Cinnamon has certain healing properties, thus it typifies the effectiveness of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Calamus is a reed which grows out of muddy places high into the air, therefore, it must signify the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Cassia, the last spice, repels insects and especially snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It reminds us of the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since the compound ointment in the Old Testament typifies the Holy Spirit, we may call the Spirit, the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With this compound Spirit, we have the Lord's sweet death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The effectiveness of His death always kills all the negative elements inside our being Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This Spirit also brings to us His resurrection with the life and its power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By this resurrection power we may overcome all our enemies, especially Satan, the snake.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only that, the Spirit also brings into us all that God is love, light, holiness, righteousness, etc. and all that God has, obtained and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What a wonderful Spirit is dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. The Moving of the Holy Spirit to Sanctify Us</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since the Spirit is a living person, He is always moving.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why in 1 John chapter two, He is not merely called the ointment, but the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are unholy naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is Holy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He always moves within us to sanctify us, that is, to separate us from the common worldly things, so that we may be filled with the holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He kills everything in us that is not of God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then He adds to us all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, to follow the teaching of the anointing is crucial to our experience and growth of life.</S>
