To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak Him forth.</P><P>All of us need to speak Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ. But the matter of speaking has two problems. On the one hand, most of the saints are too silent, but on the other hand, some are too released. Those who are too released should exercise to restrict their speaking. By doing this they will save the church from being frustrated by their over-exercise. On the other hand, those who are silent must speak because the church meetings have been killed by their silence.</P><P>The principle in the New Testament is that God the Spirit desires to see all of His people speak for Him (1 Cor. 14:1, 31), yet Satan always goes alongside the Lord's move in order to frustrate Him. God wants all of His people to speak, but Christianity has produced the clergy as the speaking class and the laity as the nonspeaking class. The Lord's recovery today is for the overthrow of the clergy-laity system.</P><P>Over the past few years, we have endeavored to build up the practice of all the saints prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ, but this has been a very difficult job. When asked why they do not speak in the meetings, some may say, "I do not know how to speak, and I do not have anything to speak, so I dare not speak. I like to be a proper member in the church life. I do not like to speak loosely." This is one of the factors which causes many saints not to speak in their meetings.</P><P>In general, I am glad to see that a number of the saints have the boldness to speak, but I am concerned that in the long run, the constant, bold speaking on the part of some saints may kill the appetite of others. Because the other saints do not hear the riches of Christ or receive the proper enlightenment from certain bold ones, they will lose their appetite for the speaking of these ones. In the long run, this kind of speaking will cause others to become disinterested. This is another factor which frustrates the speaking of all the saints in the meetings.</P><P>A small number of saints among us do not care whether or not their speaking is received. Even if someone were to ask them to stop, they would still go on speaking. This is a situation in which their boldness in speaking has developed into their "joy." Such "joy" eventually becomes their "toy." Speaking in the meeting has become their toy. For these ones to over-exercise in the meetings by speaking too much is not good.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. EXERCISING</H2><P>In the previous message, we fellowshipped that in order to prophesy we need to learn the truths and the experiences of life. Without learning the truths and the experiences of life, we have nothing to speak. This is why we need to labor. According to Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, to be a functioning member of the Lord's Body is not an easy thing. As members of the Body of Christ, we all must speak, and in order to speak, we have to learn. Furthermore, even if we have learned the truths and the experiences of life, there may still be other problems with our prophesying. There may be problems in our speaking with regard to the exercise of our spirit, our mouth, our voice, our speed, our gesture, and our accent.</P>
