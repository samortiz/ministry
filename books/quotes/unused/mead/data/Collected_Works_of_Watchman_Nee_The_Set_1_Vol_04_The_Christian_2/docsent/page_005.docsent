   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The book of Revelation really demands us to keep its words.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not vain to keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, it is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This book demands a great deal, but the blessings it bestows are also great.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although it sometimes seems very difficult to keep according to the flesh, is not the yoke of the Lord easy?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is not the burden of the Lord light?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matt 11:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He who knows the Lord will not consider the Lord a "hard man" Matt 25:24 , much less the "taskmasters" of Egypt Exo 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our sacrifice now will be for our eternal benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The loss at the present time is for a real gain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more we lose, the greater our joy will be.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is worthy of our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in order to please His heart and in order for us to gain the blessing, we must examine the hidden parts deep in our hearts to see if our love and goal are solely for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Are there, perhaps, still many things you would "spare" 1 Sam 15:9 ?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Blessed are those who can say as the psalmist, "Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way" Psa 119:128 !</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now let us look briefly into why those who read and hear this book have special blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we read the words of God with a heart for them, then to read the words of God is a blessed thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is, however, only this one book in the Bible in which God explicitly promises blessings to the readers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let us expound a little.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we see how the Lamb suffered and endured in the world, our hearts are drawn toward Him in love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This book shows us His glory so that we come to realize the greatness of the Lamb's glory which He obtained through His humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only does it speak of the Lamb's glory, but the glory of those who follow the Lamb as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This turns our dark and cloudy sky into sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What a hardship there is now for those who really love the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are impeded in everything, and for the Lord's sake they tolerate and even suffer silently.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, this book tells us that the Lord will wipe away their every tear and satisfy their hearts with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What a blessing this is!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Knowing this will strengthen the power of our endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, this book clearly tells us things that are going to take place in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone likes to know about the future so that they will know the way to prepare themselves and the principle to follow in their daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Worldly people, however, have no way to find out about the future, but our God has not kept the future in the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Revelation He tells us of future events in order for us to walk now in the light of the future so that we will not err or work in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He tells us the coming end of all worldly things so that we would come to realize that "the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who does the will of God abides forever" 1 John 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way we will not build our hope on this temporary world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, this book tells us the hope of Christ's coming again so that "everyone who has this hope set on Him purifies himself, even as He is pure" 1 John 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The coming again of the Lord is the greatest motivation for the believers' sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The truth of the coming again should govern us in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who do not know the power of God's word think that the knowledge of the Lord's soon coming makes people lazy, but no clear understanding of the truth will lead men to do things that displease God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First John 3:3-4 shuts up man's vain mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thank the Lord that there is such a blessing for those who read Revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people admit that the epistles sent to the seven churches are very useful, but they look down on the other portions on prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord, however, blesses particularly what man despises "this prophecy."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although the Lord did not speak to the churches directly in the portion on prophecy, His will is that the churches would benefit from the entire book.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord's intention is to use this book, while it is yet a prophecy and before it has become history, to open our understanding and to stir up our love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While the time is near but has not yet come, we should all the more listen to, read, and consider this book.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Revelation is a timely book for the present!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, since Revelation is a book of blessing to its readers and hearers, man begins to cultivate a selfish heart in thinking that everything in the book, including the seals, trumpets, bowls, and so forth, refers to the church!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Still, the word of the Holy Spirit is very clear!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should pay attention to this book, not because we are within the sphere of this prophecy, nor because these things have already come to pass, but because "the time is near."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not yet, but it is near.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should remember that the church is standing on grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not move the foundation of the church of Christ away into the fearful sphere of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God gave this book to us for the purpose that we may escape all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is only when we do not receive its warnings that there exists the possibility of being caught in the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To go through the tribulation is not a blessing; to escape the tribulation is indeed a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not consider all the prophecy in this book to be the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the saints at the apostolic age, who were not in the tribulation, could benefit from this book, surely it can also benefit us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible does not teach us that we will benefit from a prophecy after its fulfillment, that is, after the prophecy is over.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, it says "Blessed...for the time is near."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What time is at hand?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we compare verses 6 and 7 in chapter twenty-two with verse 3 which we just read, we will see they are almost the same.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"I come quickly" seems to have the same meaning there as "the time is near" here.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because the Lord is coming soon, those who read, hear, and keep the prophecy are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because the Lord is coming quickly, the things related to Him will also come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who do not read this book will find that they will miss something while caught in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The "hour of trial" is near 3:10 ; we should "watch and pray" that we will not be caught in it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The time of "harvest" is come Mark 4:29 ; the ripe ones will be gathered into the barn, and the green ones will be left on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The time of "judgment" is come 1 Pet 4:17 ; will we gain the prize or will we suffer loss?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The time of "restoration" is come Acts 3:21 ; the promises given by God through the prophets are soon to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Can we go in with the Lord to be kings together with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May we have only one goal, which is to please the heart of the Lord, so that we will not suffer loss in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"The time is near."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Was the time near even twenty centuries ago?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It seems that God did not set a definite time for the coming again of His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The reason why He still has not come even until today is not His delaying, but His long-suffering 2 Pet 3:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Notwithstanding, this "time" is still "near."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He intended that all the saints, from the ancient times until now, watch and be ready while they are alive for the coming of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Paul was such a one at his time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is very strange that Satan will cause people to think that since the Lord did not come back, He will never come back again, or that we will have to wait for ten million years before He will come back!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Is this not absolutely contrary to the Lord's words: "I come quickly"?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we look at the situation now the situation of the church and of the world we cannot help but repeat the words, "The time is near."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should know that the Lord Jesus could have come back at the time of John.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He did not have to wait for these twenty centuries to pass by and for any other prophecies to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As we have said before, it is the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to select seven churches that existed simultaneously at that time to show that there was actually no need to wait and that the Lord could have come back even then.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>After this, however, the Lord delayed, and these seven churches became effectively a picture of the history of the churches throughout the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is similar to the Lord's word to Peter concerning John, "I want him to remain until I come" John 21:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Oh, how I hope that I could be like Simeon: "And it had been divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ" Luke 2:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>How I long to see His face!</S>
