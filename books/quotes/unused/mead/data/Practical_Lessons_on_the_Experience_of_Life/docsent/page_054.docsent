   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREMATURE KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not give a child of seven years the knowledge of a fifteen-year-old.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That is premature knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not help, but rather it damages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A new believer may just have been saved last week and was baptized last Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although he is a dear brother, he still smokes, but at this stage his smoking does not bother him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He can still say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have seen this kind of case.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a brother may say, "Formerly I lived in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Day by day I lived in the place of gambling, but now I have dropped it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of brother is still young.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not bother him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not tell him, "Brother, since you praise the Lord, you should not smoke."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To do this is to give him premature knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to feed him just as a mother has to feed her children and let them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the child grows to a certain age, then she can give him a certain amount of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a new convert is fed in the church and grows, perhaps after two months he will drop smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if we give him premature knowledge, we will damage him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is because, on the one hand, he now knows; just as Adam and Eve took the fruit of the tree of knowledge, his eyes are now clear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, this new one does not have the growth of life, the stage and degree of life, to follow up on the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will know that he should not smoke, but he will not be able to give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way we damage his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before we tell him about smoking, he can praise the Lord with confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But now he cannot, and neither can he give up smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then his conscience is condemned, there is a breach in his conscience, and he is shipwrecked.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am not guessing about this; I am speaking something that I have seen in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Never pass on premature knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, help people to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a new believer grows, perhaps after only two weeks he will come and ask, "What is the matter?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever I smoke I am not so happy."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even at this point we should be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should simply say, "Brother, bring this matter to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Talk to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If after you pray, you have the peace to smoke, then just smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Smoke by the mercy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But after you pray, if you feel it is the Lord's grace that you give up this thing, then give it up by the grace of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps after another three days, this brother will come to the meeting and give a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Premature knowledge, however, damages.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Never set yourself up as a standard, and be careful in the church meetings when you are giving a testimony never to set up your experience as a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE ADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE FROM THE GROWTH OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should learn to deal with the conscience not according to premature knowledge but according to the adequate knowledge from the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If, for example, a sister stands up in a fellowship meeting and testifies how the Lord dealt with her way of dressing, she must be careful not to set up her experience as a standard, giving people the impression that all the sisters in the meeting must be like her.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you give this kind of impression, you are not ministering the adequate knowledge from the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other side, the other sisters should not follow the first sister simply because they heard her testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They should not say, "She is a spiritual sister.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From this day she will never dress like she did before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, I have to follow her."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This also is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The dealing with the conscience must be according to the living knowledge from the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we grow in the Lord, we gain an amount of knowledge to realize that we must deal with the Lord about certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THE SUPPLY OF GRACE WITH THE DEALING OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever there is the proper knowledge of the conscience that comes from the enlightenment of the spirit, the supply of grace always follows.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever we have the realization in our conscience to deal with certain things, we must know there is always the supply of grace to come.</S>
