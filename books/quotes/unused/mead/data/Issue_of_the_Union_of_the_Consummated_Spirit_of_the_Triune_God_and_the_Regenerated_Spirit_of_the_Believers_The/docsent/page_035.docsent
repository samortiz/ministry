   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Concerning the Eternal Life of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fifth major item in the divine revelation concerns the eternal life of God John 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Generally, in the understanding of Christians, eternal life is not a life but a blessedness in the heavens to be enjoyed forever after death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The teachers in Christianity do not give people the proper knowledge concerning the eternal life; instead, they explain the eternal life as a place where the believers go after death to enjoy the good things in the heavens forever.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What an error this is!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank the Lord that in the past seventy years He has recovered among us the scriptural view and the proper understanding concerning the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We obtained this eternal life from God through believing in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This life is the life on the highest plane; it is the divine life of God, even the complete Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is uncreated, incorruptible, indestructible, and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eternal implies that in quality, quantity, time, space, and existence, it is perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are regenerated and transformed in this eternal and everlasting, perfect and complete, incorruptible and indestructible, marvelous and wonderful life, and glorified with the consummated Triune God as our eternal glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>F. Concerning the Body of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Which Is the Church of God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sixth major item of the divine revelation in the Bible concerns the Body of Christ, which is the church of God Eph 1:22-23; 1 Cor 10:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the revelation and pattern seen in the New Testament, the church is the gathering of the believers in Christ, who are called out from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This gathering, on the one hand, is the house of the living God 1 Tim 3:15 for God to dwell in to accomplish His will according to His desire for His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other hand, it is the organic Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 for Him to have a counterpart that is organically united with Him to be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a church as the house of God and also the Body of Christ is unique in the universe, yet it is manifested and expressed in many different localities on the earth to be the many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fellowship in life of this church, whether universally or locally, is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would exhort the brothers and sisters, especially the co-workers and elders, to study thoroughly the revelation of these six major items, and even to widely teach and preach concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY THE GOD-MAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we come to the second aspect of the Lord's recovery, that is, the God-man life, which is the kind of living that the believers need to have.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The worldly people emphasize moral and ethical living and religious living; yet these are not what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What God wants is the God-man life, which is God and man living together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In your family life you should have God living together with you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a wife, you should have God be the wife with you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a husband, you should have God be the husband with you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a co-worker, you should have God be the co-worker with you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even when you go shopping, you should have God go shopping with you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have often prayed, "Lord, are You willing to go with me?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have a few words that I want to speak to Brother So-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lord, will You go with me?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not living alone but living together with God in this way is the God-man life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not religionists living a religious life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Neither are we followers of Confucius's teachings or Mencius's thoughts, living a moral and ethical life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are God-men living a God-man life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord's recovery is to recover this kind of God-man life.</S>
