   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>John 14:16-20 says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What facts can we discover here?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These sentences first use He or Him but later change to I. There is a change in pronoun.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here is a fact: The words He and Him have been changed to I.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the four principles of reading the Bible, how should we deal with this passage?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, we should discover the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this case, the pronoun change from He to I is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, we must remember this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, we must analyze this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here are two Comforters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord says, "I will ask the Father, and He the Father will give you another Comforter."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word another in the expression another Comforter means this is the second one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"And He the Father will give you another Comforter."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that the Father will give a second Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there is a second Comforter, there must be a first Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first thing we can ascertain is that the Lord is speaking of two Comforters.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord said that the disciples already had one Comforter, but that He was going to give them another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What kind of Comforter is the second?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"That He may be with you forever."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Who is the He?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus said, "The world...does not...know Him; but you know Him."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Because He abides with you."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was with them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The world cannot receive Him and has not even seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What about them?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The disciples had seen Him; they knew Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They knew Him because He was abiding with them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord said, "Because He abides with you and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After this point the pronoun He is no longer used.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the next sentence the Lord said, "I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In studying this, we find that He is I, and I is He.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, while the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He was the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit was in the Lord, and the Lord was the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord was on earth, the Holy Spirit was in Him; He and the Holy Spirit were one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why He said that the disciples beheld Him and knew Him and that He was with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But then what happened?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord went on to tell them that another Comforter would come.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Following His death and resurrection, the Lord said that He would come back to them and that God would give them the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But how was this to be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Himself would come to them again in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He did not leave them orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After a little while they would see Him no longer, but then they would see Him again, and He would abide in them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 17 says, "He...in you."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then verse 20 says, "I in you."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, the I in the second section is the He in the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once we see the change in pronouns, we see the difference in the two Comforters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first section refers to the Holy Spirit in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The second section refers to Christ in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He refers to the Holy Spirit in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I refers to Christ in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Who is the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Son is the Father in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the same way, the Holy Spirit is the Son in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is only a change in form.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>From this example we see that the first basic principle in reading the Bible is to discover the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we cannot discover any facts, we cannot expect to receive any light from God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not a question of how many times we have read the Bible, but a question of the facts we have discovered through our many times of reading.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul was a person who knew how to discover facts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Consider what he said in Galatians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He saw from Genesis that God would bless the nations through the seed of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God used the word seed in its singular form, not in its plural form.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First, Paul discovered this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He saw that the nations would be blessed through the seed of Abraham, and he saw that this was a unique seed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From this he realized that this seed referred to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If it had been plural, it would have referred to the many children of Abraham, that is, the Jews, and the meaning would be completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul read the Scripture thoroughly and discovered the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the Bible there are many facts.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether or not a person is rich in God's Word depends on how many facts he has discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more facts he discovers, the richer he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If he cannot discover any facts and if he reads through the Bible in a hasty and mindless way, he will not understand much.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In reading the Bible, we must learn to discover the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After this we should memorize, analyze, and compare these facts.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Finally, we should kneel down before God and ask for light.</S>
