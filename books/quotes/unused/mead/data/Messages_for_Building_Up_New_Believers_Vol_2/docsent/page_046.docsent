   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I HAVE BEEN CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps some will ask, How can we experience it is no longer I who live ?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can I be eliminated?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The answer to this question lies in the first part of Galatians 2:20: I am crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I am not crucified with Christ, I cannot be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I am not crucified with Christ, I am still I. How can I say, It is no longer I ? Only those who are crucified with Christ can say, It is no longer I.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for our crucifixion with Christ to become experiential, there is the need of cooperation from two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is impossible to experience this crucifixion if there is cooperation on only one side; cooperation on both sides is essential.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our inner eyes have to be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Christ was crucified on the cross, God put our sins on Christ and crucified them on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is God s side of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ died for us and took our sins away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This occurred more than nineteen hundred years ago, and we believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Similarly, when Christ was crucified, God put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as our sins were settled more than nineteen hundred years ago, our person was also dealt with at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God laid our sins on Christ, He also put our person in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the cross our sins were removed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the cross our person was also dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must remember Romans 6:6: Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not have to hope to be crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been crucified with Him, forever and unchangeably crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Christ died on the cross, we died on the cross as well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you take a piece of paper, write a few letters on it, and then tear the paper apart, you tear the letters apart as well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are tearing the paper, but as the paper is torn, the letters are torn.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible tells us that the veil of the temple was embroidered with cherubim Exo 26:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord died, the veil was split Matt 27:51 , and therefore the cherubim were split as well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The veil refers to the body of Christ Heb 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The cherubim had the face of a man, the face of a lion, the face of an ox, and the face of an eagle Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>1:10; 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This signifies all created beings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the body of the Lord Jesus was split, all the creation in Him was split as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He died that He might taste death on behalf of everything Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The whole old creation passed away with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have been trying in vain to do good and to be a successful Christian for years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now God has crucified you with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Christ was crucified, the whole old creation was split, and you were split as well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have to believe in this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Your eyes need to be open to see that your sins were upon Christ and your person was also upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your sins were on the cross, and your person was also on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your sins were taken away, and your person was also crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All this has been accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people fail because they keep looking at themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who have faith should look at the cross and see what Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God placed me in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Christ died, I also died!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But why is this person still living today?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since you have been crucified, why are you still living?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To solve this problem you must believe and exercise your will to identify yourself with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you are looking at your own self every day, hoping that it will improve, this self will become more alive; it will not die by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is death?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When a person is so weak that he cannot be weakened any further, he has died.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many people do not admit their own weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are still demanding so much from themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that they are not yet dead.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 6 says that God has crucified us with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But Romans 7 tells us of one person who is still trying to will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even though God has crucified him, he still wills to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He cannot die, yet he cannot do good either.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If he would say, Lord, I cannot make it, and I do not believe I will make it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I cannot do good, and I will not will to do good, everything would be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But Romans 7 tells us that man is not willing to die.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God has already crucified our old man, but we are unwilling to die; we still exercise our will to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today many Christians are still trying when they know very well that they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nothing can be done about these Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose there is a person who cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What can he do?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He may try his best to be patient by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whenever he prays he asks for patience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even while he is working he thinks about patience.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But the more he tries to be patient, the less patient he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead of trying to be patient, he should say, Lord, You have already crucified this impatient person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I am impatient.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I do not want to be patient and do not intend to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the way to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord has crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You should say simply, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He has crucified you, and it is futile for you to try to be patient by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God knows you cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is why He crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even though you still try to be patient, God considers you hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He has even crucified you.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is a great mistake to think you can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is also a great mistake to try to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God already knows that you cannot make it; the only way He has for you is crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Even though you think that you can make it, God says that you cannot make it and that you should die.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>How foolish it is to still make resolutions and to struggle!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God knows that you cannot make it, and it would be well with you if you agreed with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God knows that you deserve to die.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you would say, Amen, I will die, everything would be well.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The cross is God s assessment of us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In God s view we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we could make it, God would not have crucified us.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He knows that the only way for us is death.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is why He crucified us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we saw things the same way God sees them, everything would be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Brothers and sisters, God must bring us to the point where we accept His verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Here we see two aspects: First, Christ died, and we were crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is something God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Second, we have to acknowledge this fact; we need to say, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>These two sides must work together before God s work can take effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we constantly frustrate Him by trying to do good and be patient and humble, the work of Christ will have no effect on us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Our resolution to be humble or to be patient only makes things worse.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Instead, we should bow down our head and say, Lord, You have said that I am crucified, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I am useless, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I cannot be patient, and I will no longer try to be patient; You have said that I cannot be humble, and I will no longer try to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>It is useless for me to try to make any further resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I am only fit to remain on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we did this, Christ would live Himself out of us!</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We should not think that this is a difficult thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Every brother and sister should learn this lesson after he or she is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>From the beginning we must learn not to live.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Instead, we should let the Lord live.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The basic problem is that many Christians have not given up on themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>They still try to solve their problems themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The Lord Jesus has already given up on them, but they are still struggling and trying to come up with ways to live.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>They stumble again and again, only to rise up to try again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>They sin again and again, only to make more and more resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>They have not given up on themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The day will come when God grants mercy to them and opens their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>On that day they will see that as God considered them hopeless, they should consider themselves hopeless as well.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Since God has pronounced death to be the only way, they also should pronounce death as the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Only then will they come to God and confess, You have crucified me, and I do not want to live anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>I have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>From now on, it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>For years we have been so wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We have committed so many sins and have been bound by so much weakness, pride, and temper.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>It is about time that we give up on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We should come to the Lord and say, I have done enough; nothing has worked.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>I give up.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>You take over!</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>I have been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>From now on live in my place!</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>This is the meaning of it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
