   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 1: "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the beginning of this chapter, in the first verse, Jesus Christ is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This corresponds to the last verse of Revelation Rev 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, the phrase rendered "the book of the generation" is used only once, here, in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is also mentioned only once in the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament, in Genesis 5:1, "the book of the generations of Adam."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Septuagint Version was the version read by the Lord while He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One is the book of the generations of the first Adam, whereas the other is of the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The two are in contrast to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The son of David."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this book the Lord is called by this title a total of nine times: in 1:1; 9:27; 12:23; 15:22; 20:30-31; 21:9; 22:42, 45.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From Adam to the Lord Jesus there were a total of seventy-five generations see Luke 3:23-38, in which the name of Cainan is recorded twice .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why does the chapter begin not by mentioning the son of Adam, of Isaac, or of Jacob, but, rather, by singling out two names, David and Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows that this book has two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One is the line of the son of David, the line of prophets; the other is the line of the son of Abraham, the line of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this we know that the Lord fulfilled these two functions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The son of David refers to Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To say that the Lord was the son of David is to say that He would be Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In his lifetime Solomon did two particular things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One was that he spoke the word of wisdom, and the other was that he built the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord is greater than Solomon; as a prophet, He sent forth the Holy Spirit and built the spiritual temple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's being the son of Abraham means that He was to be Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In his lifetime Isaac had two characteristics: he was offered on the altar, and he married Rebecca, a Gentile woman.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord was offered in His death and resurrection, and He also married the Gentiles and brought forth the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The genealogy of a man begins with the descendants and goes back to the ancestors, whereas the genealogy of a king begins with a king and comes down to the descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The genealogy recorded in Luke traces back to the ancestors, whereas the genealogy recorded in Matthew follows the generations in succession.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verses 2-6: Here four women are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The purpose is to show that the Lord is related not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles Eph 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus did not come to call the righteous; He came to be the Savior of all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament the names of women and of Gentiles were never included in the genealogies.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, this time not only were four women mentioned, but they were all Gentile sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Tamar was Judah's daughter-in-law; she committed incest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rahab was a prostitute in Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ruth was a Moabitess.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Deuteronomy 23:3 the Moabites were forbidden from entering the assembly of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Bathsheba was not mentioned by name but was referred to as "the wife of Uriah" 2 Sam 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is to inform people as to what kind of person she was.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From this it can be seen that, whether they are Jews or Gentiles, all have a share in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the whole Bible man is used to signify the aspect of doctrine, the objective aspect, and woman is used to signify the aspect of experience, the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Examples are Solomon and the Shulamite virgin in the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although this chapter mentions fourteen kings, only David was definitely designated as "the king," for he was a man according to God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verses 7-9: Compare this section with 1 Chronicles 3:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The names of Ahaziah 2 Chron 22:2-5, 9 , Joash 2 Chron 24:25 , and Amaziah 2 Chron 25:14-16, 27 were recorded in 1 Chronicles but omitted in Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They were left out by Matthew because they 1 were born of Jezebel, 2 did evil, and 3 did not die a natural death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God punished such people until the third and fourth generation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They did not deserve to be kings; therefore, Matthew did not record their names.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verses 10-12: Here the name of Jehoiakim 2 Chron 36:4; 2 Kings 23:34-35 is missing, though it is found in 1 Chronicles 3:15-19.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jehoiakim was made king by Pharaoh king of Egypt, not by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, he heavily taxed the people that he might please Pharaoh, and he also worshipped idols.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, his name was struck from the King's genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Uzziah in Matthew 1:8 is Azariah in 2 Kings 15:1-3, 13.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Matthew 1:12 says, "Salathiel begot Zerubbabel."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, 1 Chronicles 3:17-19 says that Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is because Salathiel died at an early age, and according to the custom at that time Deut 25:5-6 , his brother Pedaiah might have married his wife and begot a son, Zerubbabel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Or, it might have been that Zerubbabel, the son of Pedaiah, was made the son of Salathiel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 12: "Jeconiah begot Salathiel."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, according to Jeremiah 22:24-30, none of Jeconiah's descendants would sit on the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although Joseph was a descendant of Jeconiah, the Lord was not Joseph's son.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is God's marvelous doing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verses 13-16: In verse 16 the genealogy turns to read "Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, the difficulty mentioned above is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 17: The genealogy of Christ has a total of forty-two generations.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Forty-two is the number for the experiencing of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is different from forty, which is the number for trials only and does not necessarily involve sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After the number forty-two is concluded, the millennium will come, a time for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Revelation mentions forty-two months.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Numbers 33 has a record of forty-two stations, and the forty-third station was Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once the number forty-two is passed, Christ comes, and there is eternal rest.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Three times fourteen generations is forty-two generations.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But when one counts the generations recorded in chapter one, there are only forty-one generations.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is because David was the last of the first fourteen generations and also the first of the second fourteen generations.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, there were forty-one generations.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Verse 19: "Joseph...being righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A righteous person is both just and kind.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Joseph was just; hence, he had to divorce such a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was also kind; thus, he was not willing to disgrace her openly but intended to divorce her secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As a righteous person, Joseph was both just and kind.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Verse 20: "While he pondered these things."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Joseph's pondering afforded God an opportunity to speak to him and to lead him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Verse 21: Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It may be rendered "Jehovah the Savior" or "Jehovah saves."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Je is Jehovah, and sus means "salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Verse 23: Emmanuel means "God with us."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is not "God is present among us" the rendering in the Chinese Union Version .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>"God with us" is broader in meaning than "God is present among us."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In Hebrew, whenever a name has "el" in it for example, Daniel, Israel, and Eli , it always means something related to "God."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>King David typifies the Lord Jesus as King: 1 the king established by God, 2 the warring king, and 3 the king despised and rejected by men.</S>
