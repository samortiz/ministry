<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Its Consummation</H2><P>Peter also tells us that the believers' growth in the divine life also has its consummation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Enter into the Eternal Kingdom of<br>Their Lord Jesus Christ Richly and Bountifully</H2><P>The believers' growth in the divine life consummates in their entering into the eternal kingdom, that is, firstly, the one-thousand-year kingdom and then the eternal kingdom, of the Lord Jesus Christ richly and bountifully (2 Pet. 1:11). We all will eventually enter into the kingdom of Christ, but some will enter richly and bountifully, whereas others will enter poorly and scarcely. We need to grow in life so that we can enter into the kingdom of Christ richly and bountifully.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Be Glorified with God's Eternal Glory as<br>the Redemption of Their Body in the New Jerusalem</H2><P>The believers' growth in the divine life will also consummate in their being glorified with God's eternal glory as the redemption of their body in the New Jerusalem (1 Pet. 5:10). Our spirit has been regenerated, and our soul is now being transformed. When Christ comes, our body will be transfigured, that is, redeemed into God's glory. That will be our glorification in the coming age. All this depends on our growth in the divine life. Thus, our growth in the divine life is good not only for the building of God's house but also for our enjoyment in the kingdom and in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</P>
