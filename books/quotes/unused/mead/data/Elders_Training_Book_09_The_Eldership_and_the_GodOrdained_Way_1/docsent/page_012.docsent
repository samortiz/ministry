   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>First, we have to go to our "Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In other words, we need to go to those close to us, that is, our relatives, neighbors, friends, colleagues, and classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Instead of going to visit people with the gospel, however, we have picked up much of Christianity's way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We invite the sinners to come to us, instead of our going to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The way that we have taken to meet and to serve in the past, in many respects, has been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must take the God-ordained, organic, scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Recently I told some of the brothers that I was like Gideon looking for the three hundred to be in one accord with me for the Lord's move Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I only care for one thing to carry out what the Lord has charged us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all need to rise up and put everything of the unscriptural practice of Christianity under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The number one thing we should do in these days is to visit people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is to follow the pattern of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must go to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not necessarily need to go to Africa or Mongolia.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can go next door to our neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can go to the homes of our relatives to bring the living Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have the high gospel, the rich truth, and the wonderful life of Christ to minister to people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After setting up home meetings with the new believers, we have to teach them the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can use appropriate portions of our publications for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now is the time for us to go out and send the truth to people's homes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the ones in these homes will be brought into functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They will talk about the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to impress the new ones that they can practice the church life in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I want to take the new way, the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the new way, we have to be raised up to spread the gospel by visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elders need to forget about spending much of their time to work for the church at a desk in their office.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They should go out to preach the gospel and baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One leading brother told me that in the past twenty years he had not brought one person to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within a short time after coming back from the full-time training in Taiwan, however, he baptized seventeen people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another brother who went to Taiwan knocked on a particular door, and the gentleman said that he was not interested.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then this brother went to the back of the house and knocked on the kitchen door.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The gentleman said again that he was not interested, and he told the brother that he could not come in. Then the brother said, "Okay, I won't come in. You come out." This brother had the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That gentleman came out, and the brother read a few pages of The Mystery of Human Life with him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then that man received the Lord, and was baptized in his bathtub.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These experiences show that we need to forget about the traditional way of Christianity and come back to the scriptural way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christianity has misled us and given us the wrong impression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have received a wrong understanding of the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not need to wait to form a mission, raise up funds, and send missionaries to go to Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can be missionaries to our neighbors right away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to budget our time to visit people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to have a revolutionized church life.</S>
