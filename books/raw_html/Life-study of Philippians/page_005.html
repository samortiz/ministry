	<h2 class="head2">D. Dissension Existing<br />among the Philippian Believers</h2><p>Even though the Philippian believers participated with Paul in the furtherance of the gospel, there was still at least some amount of dissension among them (1:27; 2:1-4; 4:2-3). As we shall see, the reason for this dissension lay in the fact that they were not one in soul. They had been regenerated in the spirit, but they had not yet been transformed in soul. They had no problem in the spirit, but there were at least some problems in the soul, particularly in the mind. Some among them had different concepts, and these different concepts were causing dissension.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SUBJECT&mdash;THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h2><p>As we have already indicated, the subject of Philippians is the experience of Christ. Concerning the experience of Christ, each chapter of Philippians covers a major point. First in chapter one we have the magnification of Christ. No matter what the circumstances are in which we find ourselves, we need to express Christ in such a way that we magnify Him.</p><p>In chapter two Paul presents Christ as our pattern. In everything we do, we need a pattern, a model, an example. Even in the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ, we need a pattern. This pattern is Christ Himself.</p><p>Chapter three indicates that Christ should be our goal, our aim. We who love the Lord and seek Him are not aimless. Our aim is Christ Himself. He is the goal toward which we press.</p><p>Finally, in chapter four, Christ is our strength. In 4:13 Paul says, &ldquo;I can do all things in Him who empowers me.&rdquo; Christ is not only the pattern and the goal; He is also the strength, the power, the dynamo. As the dynamo within us, He empowers us to live Him, to magnify Him, and to press on toward Him as the goal.</p><p>In the four chapters of Philippians we see Christ as the One lived out and magnified, Christ as the pattern, Christ as the goal, and Christ as our inward strength. This book on the experience of Christ covers four major points: the expression, the pattern, the goal, and the strength. We all need to experience Christ in this fourfold way.</p><h2 class="head2">A. For the Overcoming<br />of the Influence of the Judaizers</h2><p>It was necessary for the Philippians to experience Christ in order to overcome the influence of the Judaizers. We also need to experience Christ if we would overcome the opposition we face today. We cannot overcome the &ldquo;barking&rdquo; of religious &ldquo;dogs&rdquo; by anything we have in ourselves. The opposition is too severe to be overcome by our own efforts. For this, we need the adequate experience of Christ. We need to experience Christ in such a way that we live Him, and take Him as our pattern, goal and power. Such an experience of Christ will enable us to overcome all opposition.</p><p>The more we are opposed, the more we should live Christ. We should be like a ball full of air: the more we are suppressed, the higher we rise up. In a sense, we should be thankful for all the opposition. Because of it, we are being stirred up. However, it is not sufficient merely to be awakened and stirred up to stand against the opposition; we must go on to live Christ and to magnify Him. As we experience Christ, we shall overcome the negative influence of today&rsquo;s religionists.</p><h2 class="head2">B. For the Discernment<br />of the Preaching of Christ in Rivalry</h2><p>Through the experience of Christ, we shall also acquire discernment concerning the different ways of preaching Christ, in particular concerning the preaching of Christ in rivalry (1:9-11). The more we experience Christ, the more discernment we shall have. In fact, Christ Himself will become our discernment, our sensitive perception, our moral tact. By experiencing Christ we become sensitive and tactful. Such tact is neither natural nor that gained by education. It comes only through the experience of Christ. As we experience Christ, He becomes our perception and tact, the discernment by which we see through the intentions of others. With Christ as our x-ray, no one can hide from our perception. We all need such discernment.</p><h2 class="head2">C. For the Participation<br />in the Furtherance of the Gospel</h2><p>We also need to experience Christ so that we may participate in the furtherance of the gospel (1:27-30). Through the experience of Christ, we are able to share in God&rsquo;s move in His economy.</p><h2 class="head2">D. For the Abolishing of Dissension</h2><p>Finally, the experience of Christ is for the abolishing of dissension (2:5, 12-16). Dissension can be abolished only through the experience of Christ. The more experience of Christ we have, the less dissension there will be.</p>
