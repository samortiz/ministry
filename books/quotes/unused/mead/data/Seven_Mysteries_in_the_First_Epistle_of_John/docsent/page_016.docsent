   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY PREPARED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How could this divine Being, who is pure, holy, and righteous, be one with us?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are fallen, sinful, corrupted, and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Between the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation, there is a long record.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During this interval in time, God passed through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Adam and Eve disobeyed God by partaking of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they were in fear of the judgment to which God would sentence them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God came seeking Adam, however, His way was to ask Adam, and then Eve, some questions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather than take direct responsibility for his wrongdoing, Adam passed the blame off on Eve and also on God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God had not given him that woman, Adam implied, this problem would not have arisen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was the woman who had given him the fruit to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yes, he had eaten it, and that was wrong, no doubt; but the source of his disobedience, Adam maintained, was firstly God and then his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without rebuking, God then turned to Eve and asked, "What is this that thou hast done?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Gen 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eve followed Adam's tactic and passed the blame on to the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By inference, she was also blaming God, who had created the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without arguing or condemning, God turned to the serpent, who was given no opportunity to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was cursed and told, "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel" v. 15 . As the man and his wife stood there trembling, expecting to hear themselves sentenced to death, they heard God say that the woman's seed would bruise the serpent's head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eve would live!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam believed the gospel and therefore "called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living" v. 20 . Instead of death, there would be seed of this woman which would bruise the serpent's head.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the gospel, which Adam heard from the mouth of God and believed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The record continues, covering many years of history, until we come to Isaiah, where we have another reference to the seed of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel" Isa 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seed would be a son, yet he would be called "God with us" Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Isaiah further describes Him in 9:6, where he tells us that the child born is the mighty God and the son given is the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What wonderful Person can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some seven hundred years later, Mary, a virgin, conceived a child of the Holy Spirit, thus fulfilling these prophecies in Genesis and Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This wonderful One is Jesus, Jehovah the Savior, God with us!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God was now in human form.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was dwelling with man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At this point, however, God could not yet abide in man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Immanuel had to take another step.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This He did by passing through death and entering into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At this juncture He changed from the flesh to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit" 1 Cor 15:45, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>. THE OLD TESTAMENT PICTURE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Consider what has been added to God by this process through which He passed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Besides His divinity, He has now been compounded with humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Years ago I saw this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then one day, while I was reading Exodus 30, the Lord enlightened me that the anointing ointment precisely portrays this now-compounded Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Olive oil, which is commonly recognized as being a type of the Holy Spirit, is not the only ingredient of the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Four spices are compounded with it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The anointing ointment is made up of olive oil, myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the Old Testament picture of the processed and compounded God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not much more is said about the anointing until we come to 1 John 2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This passage clearly refers to Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Biblical scholars have not been all that clear about the significance of this compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As I did in the previous message, I would like to speak further on the numbers given us in relation to the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Four, the number of spices, stands for the creature, while three, the number of times that five hundred occurs, speaks of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The number four speaks of Christ's humanity, without which He could not have entered into death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was crucified in the flesh and thus destroyed the Devil who has the power of death Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we put four and three together, we get either seven or twelve, depending on whether we add or multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the beginning of Revelation there are the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the end there is the New Jerusalem, whose characteristic number is twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are twelve foundations, twelve gates, and twelve apostles Rev 21:12,14 , for example.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The city has four sides with three gates on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we are first saved, our number is four plus three, or seven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Eventually the numbers will be multiplied instead of added, and our new number will be twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These four spices are blended with a hin of olive oil Exo 30:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Four plus one speaks of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Four represents the creature, while one reminds us of God the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, God and man are brought together, like the four fingers of our hand and our one thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I trust we can see how full and rich a picture is given us in the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All we need is included in this processed, compounded God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To stay in Romans 6 and reckon ourselves dead with Christ is not effective.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to our experience, such reckoning is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brother Nee once said that Romans 6 can only be realized and experienced in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What is found in Romans 8?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is the all-inclusive Spirit the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, His Spirit who indwells us, the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we walk according to this indwelling Spirit, who is the compounded God, and have our mind set upon Him, we shall enjoy life, peace, victory, and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All that this compound Spirit contains divinity, the proper humanity, the death of Christ, and His resurrection will be our portion.</S>
