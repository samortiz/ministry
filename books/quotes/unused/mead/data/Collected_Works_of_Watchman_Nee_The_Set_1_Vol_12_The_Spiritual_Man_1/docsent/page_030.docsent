   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE CROSS AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are many believers you can say the majority of the believers who were not filled by the Holy Spirit when they believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the contrary, after believing in the Lord for many years, they are still entangled by sins and have become fleshly believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What we will talk about in the following portion concerning how the fleshly believer obtains salvation is according to the experience of the Corinthian believers and others like them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are not saying that a believer must first believe in the substitutionary work of the cross and later believe in the uniting work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is because many believers do not have the clear revelation of the cross from the beginning that they have only believed half of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason they need another chance to believe the other half of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the reader has completely believed the two sides of the work of the cross, this section will not be that deeply related to him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if he is like the majority and has only believed half of the truth, this section will be indispensable to him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, we want the reader to be clear that it is not necessary to believe the two sides of the work of the cross at separate times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is because of the lack in man's believing that there is the need of believing the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE SALVATION OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the apostle spoke concerning many items of the flesh in Galatians 5, he continued, "But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts" v. 24 . This is the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What the believers pay attention to and what God pays attention to are very different.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The believers are concerned about "the works of the flesh" v. 19 which are the works, item by item, of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are paying attention to sins individually: today's anger, tomorrow's jealousy, and the next day's strife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What they are sorrowful about and hope to overcome are certain sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But these are simply fruits born of the same tree.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may pick one fruit not to say that you cannot pick any one of them and there grows another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One after another they grow without end, until eventually there will not be one day of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What God pays attention to is "flesh" v. 24 , not the works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a tree is dead, do we still fear that it will bear fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Believers always plan to deal with the offenses fruits and forget to deal with the flesh the root .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, it is unavoidable that one offense has not been dealt with clearly before another offense has already come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to deal with the root of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The babes in Christ, being still of the flesh, should know more deeply the meaning of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The work of God is to crucify the believer's old man with Christ so that those who are of Christ "have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter whether it is the flesh or the strong lust in the flesh, both are crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the past it was through this cross that sinners obtained regeneration and knew that they had been redeemed by the Lord from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now it is also through this cross that the babyish, fleshly Christians perhaps already regenerated for many years can obtain salvation and be freed from the dominion of the flesh that they may walk according to the Holy Spirit and no longer walk according to the flesh, in order that they may become spiritual men before long.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus the fall of man is in contrast to the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The salvation afforded by the latter is the very remedy for the former.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One being the sickness and the other the cure, they match one another perfectly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On one hand, the Savior died for the sinner on the cross to redeem him from sin so that the holy God can righteously forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, having died with the Savior on the cross, the sinner no longer is ruled by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, his spirit regains the control, the body becomes the servant on the outside, and the soul is the medium in between.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, the original order of spirit, soul, and body is restored.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we do not first understand what the death mentioned in this verse is, we will still not be able to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May the Holy Spirit be our Revealer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"But they who are of Christ Jesus" refers to everyone who believes in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone who has believed in the Lord and has been regenerated belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No matter what this person's spiritual level is and no matter how his work is, whether he has been freed from sin, has been fully sanctified, or has ever been overcome by the lust of the flesh, all do not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The thing that matters here is whether this person has ever been joined to Christ in life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, has he been regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Has he ever believed in the Lord Jesus as Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If he has believed, no matter what his present spiritual condition is, whether he is victorious or failing, this person has "crucified the flesh" on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not a question of ethics or spirituality; it is not a question of knowledge or work; it is only a question of whether he belongs to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If he does, he has "crucified the flesh" on the cross he "is" not crucifying nor "will" he crucify, but he "has" crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must have the right focus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This verse is not speaking concerning the matter of experience regardless what your experience is but is stating God's fact.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"They who are of Christ Jesus," whether strong or weak, "have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may say you are still sinning; God says you have been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You say your temper still exists; God says you have been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You say your lust is strong; God says your flesh has been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Please do not pay attention to your experience now.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Pay attention first to God's speaking to you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If, instead of listening to and believing in God's Word, you merely look at your own experience every day, you will never have the experience of the crucifixion of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not pay attention to your feeling and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since God said your flesh has been crucified, it has indeed been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must hear and believe God's Word first then we will have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God said to you, "Your flesh has been crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You need to answer, "Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yes, my flesh has been crucified on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By doing this, you will see that your flesh has indeed been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The believers in Corinth committed adultery, had jealousy, strife, divisions, and lawsuits, and committed many other sins.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They were fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But they were "babes in Christ;" therefore they were still of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Can it be true with even this kind of believer that their flesh has been crucified?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yes, even the flesh of these fleshly Corinthian believers has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must realize that the Bible does not tell us to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, it tells us that we are those who have been crucified, because it is not that we are to be crucified by ourselves but that we have been crucified with the Lord Jesus Gal 2:20; Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since we are crucified with Christ, at the moment Christ was crucified on the cross, our flesh also was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Also, our being crucified does not mean that we were crucified by ourselves but that the Lord Jesus, at the time when He was crucified, also carried us up onto the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, in God's eyes our flesh "has been crucified" on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This matter, in the eyes of God, has clearly been done, has been accomplished, has already become a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, whether people have the experience or not, God's Word says, "They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we want to have the way to experience the crucifixion of the flesh, we do not need to pay attention to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Of course, experience is not wrong, but do not give it too much of a position.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to believe God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>"God said, my flesh has been crucified I believe my flesh has really been crucified."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>"God said my flesh has been crucified on the cross I confess that God's Word is true."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this way we will have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must first pay attention to God's fact; then we pay attention to man's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The flesh of those Corinthians, in God's eyes, had been crucified with the Lord Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But they did not have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The reason might be that they did not realize God's "fact."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, the first step for us to receive salvation is to deal with the flesh according to God's point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is not that the flesh is going to be crucified on the cross but that it has already been crucified, not according to what we see, but according to what we believe God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we are firm on this point the flesh has been crucified we will be able to go on to deal with the flesh in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Unless we do not care for all our spiritual progress and stand firm on this fact, considering that in any event our flesh has been crucified on the cross, there is no possibility for us to have the real experience.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Those who want to have the experience should not care first for their own experience but only believe in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then they can obtain the experience.</S>
