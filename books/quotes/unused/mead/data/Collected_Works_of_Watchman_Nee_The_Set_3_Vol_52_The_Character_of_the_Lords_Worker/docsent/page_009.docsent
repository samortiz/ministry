   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If God opens our heart to see that we are fellow men among all men, our attitude towards them will drastically change.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We will find man lovable and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brothers and sisters, it needs to dawn on us that man is precious in God's eyes because He created man in His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even today, man is still in the likeness of his Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Unless man becomes the object of our affection we cannot possibly become a servant of men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must find man lovable and valuable in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many brothers and sisters have an altogether wrong attitude, temperament, and sentiment toward their fellow men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They consider them a burden, trouble, nuisance, or an annoyance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is totally wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must learn to see man as God's creation with God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although man has become fallen, his future remains bright.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we regarded man as lovable, we would not feel that man is a burden, trouble, nuisance, or an annoyance to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord went to the cross for man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can our love be anything less than this?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a man is touched by the Lord in a genuine way, and if he really sees the Lord's goal in coming to the earth, he will spontaneously conclude that man is lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is impossible for anyone who has a genuine knowledge of the Lord to despise man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man is worthy of our love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All sins can be forgiven; we can sympathize with all weaknesses and activities of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are sinners, and we know what sinners are like.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet, at the same time, we know that man is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters, the Lord did not die for men because there was a great number of them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He said that the Good Shepherd forsook all to seek one lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not come to seek to save the lost sheep because there were ninety-nine of them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Good Shepherd came for one lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, even if only one person in the whole world were lost, the Lord would still have come to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of course, historically, all men needed to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But as far as the love in His heart is concerned, He was ready to come for one man, for one lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Holy Spirit did not begin searching because ten coins were lost; He searched because one coin was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Father did not wait for His prodigal because all of His sons had become prodigal; He opened His arms to one prodigal who returned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the parables in Luke 15, we see that in His work of redemption, the Lord was willing to spend Himself freely to meet the need of even one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He did not wait for the needs of many to arise before He would work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows us the intense love that the Lord has for man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, if we want to serve the Lord in a proper way, we have to cultivate an interest in man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we cannot cultivate this interest, we will not be able to do much.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if we do something, our work will be very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we are limited as a person, we will not have the capacity to embrace many people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will not fathom the full significance of redemption until we become interested in man and our hearts are enlarged to see his worth in God's eyes and in His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without this, it is vain for puny creatures such as we to try to have a share in the great work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can anyone be used to save souls if they do not love souls?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How can anyone try to save man without loving man?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If this fundamental lack of love for men is removed, many other difficulties in relation to men will vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We think that some people are too ignorant and others are too hard, but these problems should not stop us from loving them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there is love, there will not be any disdain for man, and God will bring us to the point that we take our place as men among our fellow men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When some Christian workers in urban areas go out into the country to work among farmers, they have an inordinate sense of superiority toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a despicable attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our Lord did not say that the Son of God would not be served by men.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He said that the Son of Man would not be served by men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we go anywhere to preach the gospel, we have to go as a son of man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times, however, workers consider working among some people as a humbling experience!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is right to humble oneself, but it is wrong to consciously think that we are humbling ourselves by walking among certain kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we feel that we are humbling ourselves when we walk among less educated ones, this is proof that we are not humble enough.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such humility is manmade; it is unnatural.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When our Lord came to earth, men only recognized Him as the son of Mary or as the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They only knew Him as a son of man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brothers and sisters, we have to be real men.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we are among our fellow men, we should not give them the flavor that we are above them in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not how a Christian should behave.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we are among men, we should be one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not give others the impression that we are condescending ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do, we are not qualified to serve anyone, and our way is totally wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can only serve men by being a man ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should never give others the impression that we are always humbling ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not give others the impression that we are different.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If others have that kind of impression about us, it proves that we are not God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In order to serve the Lord, we must be genuinely emptied of self.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we talk with those who have less education than we have and we stand aloof from them, we are telling them that we are not one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Unless we can humble ourselves to the lowest level, we cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must be brought to the lowest point; we must never feel that we are better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No brother or sister can despise a man of little knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Such a person has a place in God's creation; he has a place in God's redemption and plan just as you and I have.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The only difference between us and an unsaved man is that we know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brothers and sisters, we are wrong in our attitude in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must turn away completely from such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must see that all men are equal in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our Lord came to earth for all men.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, we should humble ourselves for them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should never categorize men based on the amount of education they possess.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You may say, "The ignorance of men presents no problem to me; my difficulty arises when I come in contact with men who are deceitful, sinful, and wild.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What should be my attitude toward them?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You only need to take a retrospective look at your own life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Were you better than they are now before the grace of God reached out?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How much better would you be today but for the grace of God?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Who has made you holier than they?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When you look at yourself outside the realm of grace, you cannot find any difference between you and them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Except for grace alone, what makes you any different than them?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You can only bow before God and say, "I am the same as they are, nothing more than a poor sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Only grace can teach you to prostrate yourself in the dust and say, "Lord, You are the One who has saved me."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Grace will never cause you to uplift yourself; it will always cause you to see that you are the same as the wicked and the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is God's grace that sets you apart from them, not you yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If what you have is yours through receiving, what is there for you to boast of?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If grace is the only thing that makes you different, you have no ground to exalt yourself with such grace.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You should give more thanks for grace; you should spend more time thanking the Lord for grace instead of giving glory to yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You should realize that you are the same as all other men in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You should love them.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Their sins should cause you to recoil, but you should still go out in love for them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>With such an enlarged heart, you will bring them to the Lord.</S>
