   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HELPING PEOPLE TO CALL ON THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN GOSPEL PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is another matter to which many can testify.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you preach the gospel to someone, you may think that if you can make the message logical and clear to him, he will then believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In actuality, however, you may speak one sentence, and he will argue back with three sentences; you may speak five more sentences, and he will argue with ten.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You will not win the argument.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On your part you wish to make him clear by speaking to him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yet the more you speak, the more confused he gets and the more disturbed you get.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But, praise the Lord, we have now found a secret.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we preach the gospel, it is better to speak just a few words; the less we speak, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If someone has a demon in him, when you speak, you rouse up the demon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The best way is to help him open his mouth to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a brother who truly knows how to preach the gospel in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day he met someone on the street and greeted that person with a smile, saying, Sir, let me tell you, I have Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You also need Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Will you please call with me?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Call, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unexplainably that person began to call with him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the brother asked him to call O Lord! a little louder.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was the way this brother preached the gospel, and many were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the reason?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reason is that when you call on the Lord, the demons are chased away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not think that this is superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The demons particularly usurp the human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you call on the Lord, the demon in your mind is chased away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, when others call on the Lord with you, their spirit is unconsciously opened to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When their spirit is opened, the Lord, who is the living Spirit, enters into their spirit, and they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many brothers and sisters can testify to the fact that the quickest and most effective way to preach the gospel is to help people call on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they call on the Lord Jesus, their reasonings are gone, and they cease their arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Amazingly, when a person calls on the Lord Jesus, his speaking is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Before he called, he said there was no God; but after he calls, Lord Jesus, he confesses that there is God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>CALLING ON THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>WHILE THANKING AND PRAISING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, the Bible shows us that when we are offering sacrifices to God, that is, when we are giving thanks to God, we must also call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever your heart is touched by the Lord s grace and you give thanks to the Lord, you must call on the Lord from deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The thing that most glorifies the Lord and gives Him the utmost thanks and praises is our calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you call on the Lord, the Lord truly gets the praises and thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let us look at Isaiah chapter twelve, which is a very sweet chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It begins with, God is now my salvation v. 2 . It does not say, God has saved me ; rather, it says that God is my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God Himself is the salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, if you want to receive the salvation of God, you have to receive God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is now my salvation; / I will trust and not dread; / For Jah Jehovah is my strength and song, / And He has become my salvation v. 2 . I am convinced that these words were uttered in exclamation and were cried out from deep within the spirit of the writer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because he cried out in this way, he enjoyed the riches of the Lord in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, he went on, Therefore you will draw water with rejoicing / From the springs of salvation v. 3 . How do we draw this water? The well of salvation is God Himself, and we come to draw water from this well by calling, O Lord! O Lord Jesus! When you call on the Lord in this way, you are drawing water with joy from within.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In other words, you are drinking again the water from the springs of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And you will say in that day, / Give thanks to Jehovah; call upon His name! v. 4a . We should not only give thanks but also call.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Make His deeds known among the peoples; / Remind them that His name is exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>/ Sing psalms to Jehovah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>4b-5a .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the original language, the last sentence means to shout loudly unto Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, do not consider that to shout is not refined; this concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To be sure, in the Bible there are phrases such as shout with joy, cry out and shout, sing, cried with a loud voice, and call on the Lord!</S>
