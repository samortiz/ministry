   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CARING THE MOST FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we have clearly seen that the word of God is the breath of God as food and drink to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to learn how to take the breath of God by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way to exercise our spirit is to transform what we understand from our reading into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then as we are open to the Holy Spirit, He will grant us many new experiences and new utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times when we pray in this way, it is easy to be filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do this, we will have a feast, a rich nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have the time, we can try this a second time in the day and have another meal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, we should at least have one meal a day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Forget the old way to read the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Take this new way of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not care for your concordance; just take the word in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Open the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Go book by book, chapter by chapter, and verse by verse without skipping.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just keep reading.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then when you understand something, put it into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not care for how long it will take.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Simply pray and let the Holy Spirit have the free way to get into you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not make a regulation that you must understand a certain number of items each morning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Simply open yourself very much to the Lord and leave the understanding to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Try to learn this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning whether or not we should pray aloud, I would not make a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What we do depends on two things, the Holy Spirit within and the environment without.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the Holy Spirit leads us to jump, we have to jump.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the Holy Spirit leads us to shout, we have to shout, if the environment allows.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we shout too loudly, though, we may be thrown out of our apartment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With everything in the universe, however, there is a principle, a natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In principle, it is hard for a person to pray with no voice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is hard to maintain a silent prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At least it is hard for me; I have to utter something with my voice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to keep ourselves in prayer, we may have to utter something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I say again, however, do not make a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It depends on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are open to the Lord, the Holy Spirit will lead us to release our spirit, and if the environment permits, He will lead us to pray loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The most important thing, though, is to read, understand something, and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have three parts: a body, a soul, and a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Especially in reading, we must exercise all three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We use our body with our eyes to read, our soul with the mind to understand, and our spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most Christians only go so far as to read and understand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually they are killed, and they kill others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because they know so much, they are condemned, and they condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we read the Bible in this way, the more we know how to condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because we receive the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, our eyes are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is good for killing others, condemning others, and criticizing others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we come to the message meeting and a brother turns to Genesis 2, we may say, "I know.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He will talk about the two trees."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is because we have the knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we will listen with a criticizing spirit; we will be killed, we will kill others, and we will spread much death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to break through this limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to get into the spirit, not merely to read and understand but to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should exercise our eyes a little to read the black and white letters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Spontaneously there will be no need to exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our mind is too exercised already; it is too active.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even when we sleep, our mind is still working in our many dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are good dreamers who exercise our mind too much.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no need to exercise our mind, because when we read, we will spontaneously understand something.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, we must pay our full attention to the exercise of the spirit though prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Learn this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then the Bible will be living to you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It will be a book of life and the real tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Day by day we will sit under the shadow of this tree and enjoy all its fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will not be killed, and we will not kill others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Neither will we be condemned, nor will we condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, we will be nourished, so we will be able to nourish others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Learn to read the word in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we all would practice this kind of reading, the church will be very enriched, strengthened, and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We will be so rich to nourish others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We will have the life nourishment without the dead knowledge of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May the Lord be merciful to us and deliver us from seeking the knowledge of letters, that we may take the word as the nourishment of life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I would ask you to take this and put it into practice.</S>
