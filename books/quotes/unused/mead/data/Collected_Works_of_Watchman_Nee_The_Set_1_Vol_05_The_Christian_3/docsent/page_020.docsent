   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The two natures revealed here by the Lord are related.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He has seven Spirits and also seven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has seven stars and also seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, these things are rejected by Protestantism, which Sardis signifies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, we are talking about the reality here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In all Protestant denominations, there are many spiritual men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They pay much attention to the matter of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This, of course, is most crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To them, the question of church administration is insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whether or not the Lord is able to execute His authority or to govern everything is a matter that they have neither the time nor the willingness to care about.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To them, spirituality is everything if believers can grow and be mature in their spiritual life, and if they can fellowship with the Lord and walk according to God's will for individual believers without failure, the many troublesome questions concerning the denominations can be ignored: "Even the best saints cannot be in one accord concerning the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is better that we give up this controversial question."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although these believers are somewhat wrong, I can excuse their attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In doing this, they are acknowledging the Lord as the One with God's seven Spirits but are denying that He has the seven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They pay attention to the Lord's spiritual power, but ignore the Lord's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the Lord does not go along with them for one moment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord does consider the spiritual life and authority to be something that Protestant churches should have.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if the Lord considers church administration to be something insignificant, as they do, the Lord would not have the need to unveil Himself as the one with the seven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our question is not which ecclesiastical system we should follow: congregationalism, episcopalianism, or presbyterianism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What we and the Lord are seeking is that the Lord Jesus be the practical Head in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No worldly person should usurp His position.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is unimportant which ecclesiastical system one follows.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The question in any system is whether or not the opinions of the one or the many are set aside, and whether the Lord Jesus has the full authority to direct everything in administration and meeting; whether He can use His gifts at will; whether the Holy Spirit is the "chairman" of everything; and whether His words are being honored above all human ordinances and creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, all Protestant denominations and sects cannot answer this question directly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although those believers who emphasize spirituality consider that their spiritual life is the most important thing and that the church administration can be carried out at random, the Lord considers that the authority of the church, like the source of spiritual life, depends fully on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of course, we have to admit that spirituality is the first thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without spirituality, even with the most perfect ecclesiastical order, we have nothing but a fa ade.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps this is the reason the Lord mentions the seven Spirits of God first.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, after there is the spirituality, if one does not obey the Lord, keep His word, and allow Him to have the full right in everything, how can this spirituality be expressed?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Lord is not given the proper sovereignty over the meeting, and if one is standing on unscriptural ground, how can one be mature in spirituality?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that some saints are in the organizations, but they are not yet mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, this is not surprising at all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The nature of the spiritual life is such that if someone is hampered on one side, he can still have lopsided growth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those believers who are not clear concerning the position of the church may grow spiritually, but their growth is lopsided!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such ones will suffer great loss as far as the Lord's mind, His will, His glory, and His word are concerned!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps such ones may not realize it themselves!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is useless for believers to compare their own lives with Jezebel or Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be higher than these cases is not a proof that one has obtained favor in the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If believers have not acknowledged the Lord as the One with God's seven Spirits in life and have not acknowledged the Lord as the One with the seven stars in church position, they must once again hear the Lord's questioning of the church in Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The saints should remember that the seven stars belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was not just one star, but seven stars.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only those who recognize Christ as Lord and who work for the Lord by acknowledging His authority and administration can bear responsibility according to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only those who shine for the Lord can be in one accord to do a united work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"And there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord" 1 Cor 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fleshly man divides Paul and Apollos into two and chooses between the two the one he wants to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet neither the planting Paul nor the watering Apollos was anything because "he who plants and he who waters are one" 1 Cor 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All works are done according to what the Lord has given and based upon His distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All those who shine for the Lord receive charge from the same Lord and are striving towards the same goal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everyone has his own gift and works and his own responsibility for which he is directly responsible to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet everyone is called and is working harmoniously together, accomplishing harmoniously the work under the one Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Individual responsibility does not annul mutual dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course every church has its own star.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This speaks of the responsibility of the seven stars in their respective localities.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, this does not mean that they are independent, because He who has the seven stars is the same Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a principle cannot be carried out in all places, it cannot be carried out in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The principle of responsibility that one locality bears is the principle of responsibility that all localities should bear together.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Wherever they are scattered, the churches of God should take the same path.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although God's children everywhere cannot be united together now, we must nevertheless recognize such a thing as the church in God's will and thought.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What the church of God in Corinth keeps is what "those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place" 1 Cor 1:2 ought to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to realize that the universal church of God is only a magnification of a local church, and a local church is only a miniature of God's universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If God's children have an accurate view concerning the church of God, they will not be concerned only for their localities but will also have a world view.</S>
