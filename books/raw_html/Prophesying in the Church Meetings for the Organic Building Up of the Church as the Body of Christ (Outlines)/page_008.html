FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 12:2-6; Lam. 3:22-26; Luke 1:41-45, 46-55, 67-79</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="20">
<li>The patterns of prophesying:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Isaiah being a prophet&mdash;2 Kings 19:2; Matt. 1:22-23; cf. Isa. 7:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Most of the book of Isaiah is not foretelling but a speaking forth of the Lord.</li>
		<li>Isaiah spoke for the Lord, spoke forth the Lord, and spoke the Lord into the Lord&rsquo;s children.</li>
		<li>Isaiah 12:2-6&mdash;a representative portion from Isaiah with the constituting elements of prophesying:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Speaking based upon and with the riches of the Word:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) God, Jehovah, is my salvation&mdash;Deut. 32:15; Psa. 62:1-2.</li>
				<li>2) Jehovah is my strength and song&mdash;Exo. 15:2; Psa. 118:14.</li>
				<li>3) Give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon His name, declare His doings among the peoples&mdash;Psa. 105:1; 145:4.</li>
				<li>4) Make mention that His name is exalted&mdash; Psa. 34:3; 18:46.</li>
				<li>5) Sing unto Jehovah; for He hath done excellent things: let this be known in all the earth&mdash;Exo. 15:1; Psa. 98:1; 8:1.</li>
				<li>6) Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great in the midst of thee is the Holy One of Israel&mdash;Psa. 47:1, 5; 48:1-2.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Having the inspiration of the Spirit with a clear view:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) New light&mdash;drawing water out of the wells of salvation by giving thanks to Jehovah (praising the Lord), calling upon His name, declaring His doings among the peoples, making mention that His name is exalted, singing unto Jehovah, and crying aloud and shouting.</li>
				<li>2) All the prophets in the Old Testament were seers (1 Sam. 9:9), meaning that a prophet, such as Isaiah, by his very constitution, is a person who sees&mdash;Isa. 1:1; 2:1.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>Jeremiah being a prophet&mdash;Jer. 1:1, 4; Matt. 2:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Most of the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations are not foretelling but a speaking forth of the Lord.</li>
		<li>Jeremiah spoke for the Lord, spoke forth the Lord, and spoke the Lord into the Lord&rsquo;s children.</li>
		<li>Lamentations 3:22-26&mdash;a representative portion from Jeremiah&rsquo;s speaking with the constituting elements of prophesying:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Speaking based upon and with the riches of the Word:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) It is of Jehovah&rsquo;s lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed because His compassions (mercies) fail not&mdash;Exo. 34:6-7; Psa. 78:38.</li>
				<li>2) Jehovah&rsquo;s lovingkindnesses in the morning, His compassions, and His great faithfulness&mdash;Psa. 92:1-2; 36:5; 25:6.</li>
				<li>3) Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in Him&mdash;Psa. 16:5; 73:26; 33:18.</li>
				<li>4) Jehovah is good unto them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeketh Him&mdash;Psa. 27:14, 8; 24:6; 105:4; 119:2.</li>
				<li>5) It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah&mdash; Psa. 52:9; 40:1; 25:5.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Having the inspiration of the Spirit with a clear view:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) New light&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s lovingkindnesses and compassions being new every morning and Jehovah being the portion of our soul.</li>
				<li>2) Jeremiah having visions from Jehovah&mdash; Lam. 2:9; Jer. 1:11, 13.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
	</ol></li>

			</ol></li>
		<li>Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, being filled with the Holy Spirit&mdash;v. 41.</li>
		<li>With a clear view:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Of Mary being blessed among women (v. 42), being the mother of her Lord (v. 43), and being blessed because of believing (v. 45).</li>
			<li>Of the Man-Savior:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) In His humanity as the fruit of Mary&rsquo;s womb (Isa. 4:2).</li>
				<li>2) In His deity as her Lord (v. 43: Psa. 110:1).</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>

			<li>He has done mighty things with His arm&mdash; Psa. 89:10; 98:1; Isa. 40:10; 51:9.</li>
			<li>He has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their heart&mdash;Dan. 4:37.</li>

			<li>Indicating that the Man-Savior would grow up in a family that was full of the knowledge and love of God&rsquo;s holy Word.</li>
			<li>An example of sisters being qualified to prophesy&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 11:5; Acts 2:17-18; 21:9.</li>
			<li>Showing that we need to be filled with the knowledge of the holy Word in order to prophesy and in order to have Christ, spiritually speaking, conceived in us (cf. John 1:1, 3; Luke 8:11), formed in us (Gal. 4:19), and produced through us (cf. John 15:7-8; Gal. 5:22-23; 2 Pet. 1:4-11).</li>
