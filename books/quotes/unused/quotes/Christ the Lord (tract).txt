He is the eternal God, who has become man; and as man, He has been exalted to the highest position in the universe
It is not difficult to understand that God is Lord of all, but it is not commonly known that the man Jesus is Lord as well
It is marvelous that a man has attained to such a position, that as a man Jesus Christ sits enthroned as the Lord of all
Because of His accomplishments, His attainments, and His obtainments we can be led into a salvation on the highest plane
The Three of the Divine Trinitythe Father the Son and the Spiritare eternally God coexisting and mutually indwelling one another eternally
We have all met persons who won our highest admiration, but none of us has ever witnessed the conduct of a God-man
When He died, He accomplished our redemption as the perfect man, paying the price for our offenses against God and reconciling us to God
As He was in His human living, so He was in His death, accomplishing an eternal redemption through His divine and human existence
Of course, as God He is fully acquainted with the heavens, but as a man He brought humanity to a new plane, the highest plane
In His living on earth, He lived out the divine attributes in His human virtues, thus expressing what God is in humanity
He has attained for humanity the highest peak-the exalted human virtues expressing the divine attributes for eternity
There is a man upon the throne in this universe, and Christ will reign as both God and man on the throne for eternity
He has obtained the throne, and He has obtained the glory and honor attendant to His status as the exalted Son of God
The highest name in the universe is that of the Lord Jesus Christ, and His name is the one name given by God through which men may be saved
As God, He has always been the Lord; but through death, resurrection, and ascension, He has been made Lord of all in His humanity
He causes all things to operate for the accomplishment of God's eternal plan, or economy, which includes our salvation and glorification
He is fully God and yet fully man, and as man He has been resurrected and exalted to the highest position in the universe
