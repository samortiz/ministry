"For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh" (Phil. 3:3). The confidence in the flesh has been lost because of the circumcision not made with hands. Here the apostle reckons boasting "in Christ Jesus" as the center of all things. He points out the danger to us on the one hand, and the guarantee on the other. Confidence in the flesh easily ruins our boasting in Christ Jesus, while worshipping in spirit causes us to gain the blessing of life and truth. The Holy Spirit exalts the Lord Jesus and humbles the flesh. If we want to boast in Christ and want Him to boast in us, if we want to glory in Christ Jesus in our experience, we must, on one hand, receive the circumcision of the cross and, on the other hand, learn to worship in the Holy Spirit. There is no need for strife because strife is the work of the flesh. There is no need for methods because methods are only necessary when the flesh is employed. It is absolutely a matter of having no confidence in the flesh, regardless of how nice or capable we are. We should believe only in the Holy Scriptures and submit only to the Lord. If there is faith and submission, the flesh will be humbled, stay in its cursed position, and lose its power. May God be gracious to us so that we will look down on ourselves more and more, rely less and less on ourselves, and realize more and more deeply how absolutely useless we are. May we have absolutely no confidence in the flesh. This is the real death. Without death, we will not have this experience.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_067.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 08: The Present Testimony (1) &nbsp; pg 68</div><br></body></html>
