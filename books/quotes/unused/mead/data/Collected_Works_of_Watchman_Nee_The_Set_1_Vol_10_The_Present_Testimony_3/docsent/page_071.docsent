   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord had this same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>May we know Christ and the power of His resurrection more deeply day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The goal of Paul's life was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not consider himself as having already obtained or as being already perfected, but he pursued after the power of Christ's resurrection in order to know, that is, experience it Phil 3:12, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He did not want to know just the fact of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 2 Corinthians 4:8-10 he said, "We are pressed on every side but not constricted this indicates the outward circumstances ; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was Paul's environment and his life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He experienced a great deal of pressure outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, he experienced a great deal of power inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The outward pressure was for the manifestation of his inward power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of our environment is arranged for us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please remember that whether we are at home, in school, working in an office or in any other place, it is God who has arranged the environment for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether we are in a good environment or an adverse environment, we should remember that God's intention is for us to manifest the resurrection life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether or not we are growing depends on how we deal with our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the things that oppress us are for the purpose of training us in order that we will gain the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who are the ones who have the power?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more we grow, the more power we have.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But what does it mean to have greater power and deeper life?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It means that we encounter greater pressure and are able to deal with such pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we want to know how deep a believer's life is, all we need to consider is the way he deals with pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a pity that Christians always want to preserve their natural power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times we do not want to die, and we do not want the Lord to die.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if the Lord had not died, there would have been no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians wish that there were fewer problems and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever they encounter upsetting, painful, or mournful things, they ask God to remove them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do this, we will only be living, but we will not be resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we can only endure the rebuke of ten persons, we may ask God not to give us temptations from more than ten persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But God may give us the pressure of eleven persons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may say to God that we can bear it no longer and that we are not able to do what we should.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this is exactly where God wants to bring us; He wants us to be so pressed that our own strength, our natural patience, and our fleshly goodness will not be able to sustain us any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we can only say to Him, "I can stand no more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Grant me the strength to overcome these things."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will see that we are not only able to overcome the pressure from ten persons, but able to overcome the pressure from twenty, and we will receive fresher and greater strength.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the greater the pressure, the greater the power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we find ourselves powerless, it is because we have not passed through the discipline of pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But we do not have to wait until we are at the end of ourselves before we look to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As soon as we find the situation too difficult to handle, we should look to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way we will receive the power.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every time we encounter new pressure, we should turn the pressure into power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do this time after time, our power will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God never keeps anything natural; He only wants resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He wants everything natural to go through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God never changes the natural things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the God who gives life to the dead and the One who calls things not being as being Rom 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To call things not being as being is the creative power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To give life to the dead is the resurrection power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The God whom Abraham believed is the God who gives life to the dead and calls not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man wants to keep and preserve his own life, but God does not want such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God wants to cast it down.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After your life has been cast down by Him, you will say to God, "O God!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am just like a dead body lying before You."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then God will give you resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the secret to life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Day by day as you face more pressure, remember that pressure is power.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You should not neglect pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the end the greater the pressure you face, the greater the power you have, and you will find yourself overcoming everything and receiving more power.</S>
