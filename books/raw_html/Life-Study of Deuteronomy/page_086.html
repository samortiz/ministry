<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REHEARSAL OF THE LAW</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(14)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Deut. 20:1-20; 21:10-17</H1><P>In this message we will consider three matters: the children of Israel going forth to battle against their enemies (20:1-20), the marrying of a beautiful woman among the captives (21:10-14), and the right of the firstborn son (21:15-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Concerning the Children of Israel<br>Going Forth into Battle against Their Enemies</H2><P>Deuteronomy 20:1-20 is concerned with the children of Israel going forth into battle against their enemies. Today we are also in a war. In this war we are fighting for Christ and we are fighting to remain in Christ. The good land is a type of Christ. If we would live in Christ as our land, we need to fight.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not Fearing Horses, Chariots,<br>and a People More Numerous Than They</H2><P>When the children of Israel saw horses, chariots, and a people more numerous than they, they were not to fear them, for Jehovah their God was with them (v. 1). They could be assured that as along as God was with them, they would be victorious.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Priest Speaking to the People</H2><P>When God's people drew near to the battle, the priest was to approach and speak to them. He was to say these words: "Hear, O Israel! You are drawing near to the battle against your enemies today. Do not let your heart fail; do not be afraid nor alarmed nor terrified of them. For it is Jehovah your God who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to save you" (vv. 3-4). Since the mighty One was fighting with them, they could be at peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Officers Speaking to the People</H2><P>In verses 5 through 7 we have the first speaking of the officers to the people. This speaking indicates that God did not force the Israelites to go to war. If any man had built a new house and had not dedicated it, he could return to his house, "lest he dies in the battle and another man dedicates it" (v. 5). If any man had planted a vineyard and had not partaken of it, he could return to his house, "lest he dies in the battle and another man partakes of it" (v. 6). If any man had gotten engaged to a woman and had not taken her to himself, he could return to his house, "lest he dies in the battle and another man takes her to himself" (v. 7). All those who had a new house or vineyard or were engaged could return home to enjoy life.</P>
