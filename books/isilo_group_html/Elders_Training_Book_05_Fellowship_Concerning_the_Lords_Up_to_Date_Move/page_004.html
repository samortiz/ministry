UP-TO-DATE RECOVERY</h2>
<p>What is the vision that the Lord has shown us for His up-to-date recovery? We all know that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery did not begin with us. The Lord began His recovery at least by the time of the reformers, among whom was Martin Luther. The main item that was recovered at that time was justification by faith. After that, the matter of the inner life was recovered through people like Madam Guyon, Father Fenelon, and Brother Lawrence, the so-called mystics. This was a reaction to the dead Protestantism in the 1600&rsquo;s. At about the same time sanctification by faith, the so-called holiness, was discovered. The brotherhood of the believers was discovered firstly by the Northern European brothers in the 1600&rsquo;s and later in the early 1800&rsquo;s by the Plymouth Brethren. Around Germany there were different kinds of &ldquo;brother&rdquo; churches, such as the Grace Brothers and even the Mennonites. Small items were also discovered such as baptism by immersion instead of sprinkling; because of this the Baptists were raised up. Administration which is not by bishops but by the presbytery, the elders, was also recovered; with this the Presbyterian denomination was raised up. Then the so-called gifts were discovered, giving rise to the Pentecostal movement. All these may be called sundry items. Immersion is a small item, the presbytery is a small item, and even the gifts are a very small item in relation to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 12 when Paul lists the gifts, he puts tongues and interpretation of tongues at &ldquo;the tail&rdquo; (12:8-10, 28). Although Paul lists tongues and interpretation of tongues as the last item among the gifts, some would uplift them not only as the head, but as the crown upon the head. This is altogether too much. Do you believe that the recovery of tongue-speaking is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? It is just one unimportant item of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Paul says that tongue-speaking builds up the individual, but does not build the church (1 Cor. 14:4). The problem with the discovery of the miraculous things is that some made these things the unique things. Even justification by faith is not the unique thing. Sanctification is not the unique thing. The inner life is not the unique thing. Needless to say, immersion or the presbytery are not the unique thing. Later, we will see what the unique thing is.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s New Testament move has been on this earth for nearly two thousand years. In this time the Lord has done very much. He has brought the gospel to every corner of this earth. His Word, the Holy Bible, has been translated into almost every language and dialect of man. Many have been brought to the Lord. Now we must consider several issues. First, in such a great work as this, how much has been carried out by the fundamentalists with the Word, and how much has been carried out by the Pentecostals with the Spirit? Perhaps more than ninety percent of the Lord&rsquo;s move in these two thousand years has been carried out by the fundamentalists with the Word. Less than ten percent has been carried out by the Pentecostals with the so-called &ldquo;Spirit.&rdquo; Second, if there were no Bible or expounding or teaching of the Bible on this earth, but only the Spirit with all the gifts, what would be the situation today? It would certainly be poor. Third, we must consider the way of the major denominations today. Beside the Catholic church there are the Episcopalian, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Baptist denominations. Of these, the Southern Baptists have the greatest membership. They do not speak much concerning the Spirit. Rather, they depend upon their Sunday school lessons. Qualified writers work the year around to compose the Sunday school lessons to be used in the next year. Basically, the Southern Baptists do not trust in their big meetings, but in their Sunday school lessons.</p>
<p>The fundamentalists&rsquo; way is with the Word. Since the middle part of the last century, the Pentecostal movement has risen up. Within this one and one-half centuries what has been built up by the so-called &ldquo;Spirit&rdquo; with the gifts? Only the Assembly of God has been built up. In half a century the membership of the Assembly of God has risen very quickly. But in their classes they taught their students not to try to build up the church by tongue-speaking. Instead they were told to build by teaching the Bible. All the other branches of the Pentecostal movement have been coming and going, even disappearing, but the Assembly of God stands because in their meetings they teach the Bible. In China, in 1936, I attended one of their meetings. A learned American missionary was there taking the lead by teaching people. They do not oppose tongue-speaking. Rather, they practice it privately, but they do not trust in this for the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE THING</h2>
<p>Throughout the past twenty centuries the work of the Spirit has been talked about and experienced by different Christians. In my study of spiritual books I have encountered the term &ldquo;the second blessing.&rdquo; The inner life people always encourage others to have a second blessing. That means that after you have been regenerated, you need another blessing. The fundamentalists use another term&mdash;the fullness of the Spirit. After you have been saved, you must seek after the fullness of the Spirit. Then the Pentecostal saints use another phrase&mdash;the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The Friends denomination, the Quakers, emphasize the experience of &ldquo;quaking.&rdquo; In Taiwan one denomination picked up the way of shaking their chairs to receive the power of the Spirit. The second blessing, the fullness of the Spirit, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, quaking, and chair shaking, all refer to the same thing in a broader sense. We should not be narrow. We should have a broader view. Do not stress so much that the second blessing is the unique thing. Actually this thing is about the same as the fullness of the Spirit. The fullness of the Spirit is about the same thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is about the same thing as quaking. If the inner life people stress the inner life as the unique thing as opposed to all other kinds of terminology, that is wrong. Every person firstly must be regenerated and then must be filled with the Spirit. No one can deny this fact. But how to express this and how to experience it may vary. It may differ according to your background and your environment.</p>
<p>In my home town of Chefoo, not too far from our hall was another hall where a group of Pentecostals met. Once their leader came to me trying to convince me to take up the Pentecostal way. I said to him. &ldquo;Brother, I surely know what your intention is in coming here. Since you have been in your way for years, how many do you have meeting with you?&rdquo; When he told me that they were under one hundred, I replied, &ldquo;I am not in your way, but among us are close to one thousand. Do you have the power or do I have the power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many Christians are narrow minded and short sighted. Once they get something, they would stay with that one thing and make it the unique thing. This is wrong. We have to believe in history. Christianity has been on this earth for nearly two thousand years. Millions have been saved and thousands became giants serving the Lord, including John Wycliffe, the reformers among whom was Martin Luther, Madam Guyon, Father Fenelon, Brother Lawrence, Zinzendorf, John and Charles Wesley, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, and the Brethren teachers, among whom were J. N. Darby, William Kelley, and C. H. Mackintosh. The Brethren were especially powerful. They nearly saturated the entire earth with the truths they had seen from the Word. Then there were Charles Spurgeon, G. Campbell Morgan, S. D. Gordon, A. J. Gordon, Andrew Murray, Charles Finney, D. L. Moody, A. B. Simpson, Watchman Nee, and today there is Billy Graham. All of these brothers did not take the way of the so-called Pentecostal movement. Can we exclude them? Of course not. We must broaden our view to see the whole matter.</p>
<p>Now I would ask you, are we Lutheran? Are we mystics? Are we Brethren? Are we Presbyterian? Are we Methodists? No, we are not. Then what are we? Praise the Lord we are so small, but we are all-inclusive. We do not stress anything as &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; Only one thing is &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; In the next chapter we will see what the one thing is.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 05: Fellowship Concerning the Lord's Up-to-Date Move &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
