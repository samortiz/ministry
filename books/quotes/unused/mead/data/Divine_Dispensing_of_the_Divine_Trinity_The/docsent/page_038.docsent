   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The seven lamps shining signify the seven Spirits of God for expression.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So the lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God, with God the Father s nature, God the Son s form, and God the Spirit s expression.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But John told us that the church is a golden lampstand as the embodiment and expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How we need to see that the church is just the embodiment of the Triune God with the Father s nature, with the Son s form, and the Spirit s expression.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a clear view of the Triune God in His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Father as the source is on the throne with the Lamb because He is the redeeming God, the Lamb-God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is only one throne, but two are sitting on the one throne.</S>

   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lamb is for redeeming, and the tree is for nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The life-dispensing river circles the entire city as it flows downward from the throne of the Lamb-God in a spiral flowing.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a city built with the Triune God as the materials and supplied and nourished also by the Triune God as the life supply.</S>
