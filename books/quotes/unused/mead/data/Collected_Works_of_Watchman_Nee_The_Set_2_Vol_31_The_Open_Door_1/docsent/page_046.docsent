   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Shaohsin, Chekiang Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my beloved brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received the large package you sent through Mr. Hsie.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May the Lord give you faithfulness and prudence in distributing food among the poor in His household.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The warplanes bombed Siao-Shan, and the city is completely burned to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The people of Shaohsin are in terror.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They are gradually moving to the mountainous country; the streets of the city are deserted and desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Most of the brothers and sisters in the city have moved to the villages in the hills, but Brother Shan Kai-fen is still responsible for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are very few people in them though.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many believers have gone to the region of Ping-Shui, but they are scattered in all the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No meeting has been raised up yet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My third elder brother, Ji-pu, has also moved to Shi-Chien-Chun in Ping-Shui.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mailing Address: Mr. Hu in Shi-Chien, c/o Loh-Ching-Mo Lime Store, West Road Intersection, Ping-Shui, Shaohsin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My family also plans to move to Shi-Chien.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are still in Hua-She because my wife has not agreed yet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church in Hua-She continues as usual; however, it is hard to make a living, and the environment is frightening.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Tang Shou-ling came to give a conference in the region of Nan-Sha, and the churches had great progress.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I also went to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many who practice living in Christ, rejoicing always, praying without ceasing, and giving thanks in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They also are putting their wandering thoughts under control.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I received a letter from Brother Hsie Yin-seng of Shanghai saying that he had no news of his company's store in Soochow nor of Brother Kao Guo-jeng.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The warehouse in Shanghai was destroyed, and he lost more than one thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He has goods in warehouses in Huchow, Soochow, and Hangchow, as well as a house and furniture in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If these are also damaged, he may be in debt.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope you will remember him in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With regard to the gospel work, it depends on the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a need in the region of Ping-Shui.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one has preached the gospel there because the people in the hill villages have deep-rooted superstitions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We hope the Lord will open a door for us for the gospel, and we hope that you will pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Greet Sister Lee, Sister Chang, and Brother Tsi-yi.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It really is the Lord's marvelous grace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the first day of this year, I found myself weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May the Lord press me to pieces so that His life may flow out!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the Lord does not give grace, what can I do?</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am now living with Sister Chang, who is on her way from Foochow to Southeast Asia, and with Sister Sung An-hwei from Tsinan, who came here to escape the war.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have all received the Lord's grace and are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am really in fear and trembling before God, beseeching Him to preserve me and to give me a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that I would know how to serve the sisters with His love and how to handle everything.</S>
