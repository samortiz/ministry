It seemed that all hope had been lost a few times when I met with dangers, but the almighty God led me through the valley of death. I am also very thankful for the desperate concern that the brothers and sisters had for me. Thank you for praying for me. You can now change your prayers into praises. God opened the way for me to come down from the mountain on April 19 and arrive in Hangchow on the same day. I stayed there for nine days before there was an opportunity to safely come to Shanghai by car (the twenty-eighth). Hallelujah! It really is God's marvelous miracle! I am temporarily staying above the meeting hall. My wife and children are staying at my parents-in-law's house. My mother is staying with her sister-in-law. It is difficult to narrate what we went through. The house and furniture which I had rented in San-Chiao-Bu were burned and destroyed. Long before this happened, I had taken my family to Yah-Dan-Ou for refuge, so we were not killed. We later moved to Mo-Gan-Shan because there was a wave of banditry in Yah-Dan-Ou. I was held up by bandits on February 25. They robbed me of money and clothes (a limited amount), and then hit me with a rifle and wounded me. It really was the grace of God that the wound was in the exact center of my chest above the sternum. The doctors said that if the blow had hit me slightly to the left or right or up or down, it would have been fatal. At the time, the wound was very bad. My entire chest swelled up and got red. God did a marvelous miracle and did not allow it to worsen. It got better in a few days. My health is the same as before, except that I tire more easily. The nine days in Hangchow were worse than the time on the mountain. We slept on hard concrete. There was nothing to eat but very coarse food. We were all sick by the fourth day. When we came to Shanghai, we carried our luggage ourselves. We carried it on to the car, off the car, over the pedestrian overpass, and put it into the bus ourselves. I am afraid that we really did not have any extra strength. Unfortunately, these sufferings cannot be counted as suffering for the Lord's sake. I went to see the meeting place in Hangchow once. The walls were broken down, and the building was in complete ruin. Brother Ruan Chi-yu is still in Hangchow. His faith remains strong. I was strengthened much in my half-hour conversation with him. Mr. Sun Wen-yuan's family, Brother Chou Hsing-yi's family, Miss Yeh Chui-chung's family, Mrs. Yu Siao-ke's family, and my family were all on the mountain. We had the Lord's Day meetings and often had prayer meetings. We only had "a little strength." I personally did nothing more than sow a few seeds of the gospel into some sinners and contact some Gentiles and seekers. Mrs. Sun was very diligent in the gospel. She took Miss Yeh to many people's homes. I was overjoyed after I read The Open Door and learned that the co-workers were all under God's protection. Once the burden that had been weighing on my heart for six months fell away, I became very released. I hope that the Lord will bring us face to face with one another. Please pray for Brother Chou Hsing-yi. He was robbed just as I was. He is very weak physically. As I write, his fever is rising. It seems that he has contracted malaria. I think it is the cumulative effect of all that we have gone through. Please pray for him.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Shou-ling<br />May 2<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_143.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_145.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 144</div><br></body></html>
