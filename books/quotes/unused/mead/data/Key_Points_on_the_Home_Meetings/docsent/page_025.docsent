   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING SPIRITUAL EDUCATION IN CLASSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON THE LORD S DAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Cutting straight the word of the truth is like carpenters cutting wood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They cannot cut according to their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They must first draw straight lines on the wood; then they must cut accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we cut straight the word of the truth, we cannot make it skewed or crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible we have in our hand is not an ordinary book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I exhort you young people to read it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need more Timothys to be raised up among us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In every place we should have some Timothys who can cut straight the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After they cut it, they should commit it to those who can teach others the same.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be very clear that the church is the pillar and the base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the church meeting is a place where we come to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Taiwan, the standard of education is very high; education is also becoming very widespread.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a worldwide trend.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But before God we also need to receive our spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is here to uphold the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the saved ones must come here to receive the proper spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even people in the world know that without education a man is wild and unlearned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once a person has received some education, his behavior will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We, the saved ones, should always remember that not only do we need God, but we also need to have a clear knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You young sisters who are fourteen or fifteen years old will one day be mothers and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The best equipping to prepare yourselves to be mothers and wives is the spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I always consider that there must have been some reason that God chose Mary to be the mother of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Mary was found to be with child, she went to visit her cousin Elizabeth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Luke chapter one Mary had a psalm of praise to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That whole psalm was a quotation from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This proves that although Mary had never gone to a seminary, she was very familiar with the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No wonder God chose her to be the mother of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, we must see that Christians need to receive two kinds of education.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only do they need to receive the worldly education; they must also receive the spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s education is a truth education.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must all learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord s recovery has been on the earth for sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since October 1984, we began to turn our attention from the big meetings to the small meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To this day, we are still studying to find a way for all the brothers and sisters to receive spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we made the decision to have classes on the Lord s Day to teach the truth lessons beginning from January 1986.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now a few brothers and I are preparing twenty-four lessons for this kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The topics and main points are all there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our plan is to prepare forty-eight lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In each quarter we will cover twelve lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are fifty-two weeks in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Besides the forty-eight weeks of proper lessons, we reserve one week at the end of every quarter for review.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The topics we have selected are as follows: The first lesson is on the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The second lesson is on the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The third lesson is on God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we go on to Satan s corruption, and then to God s calling, His promise of redemption, and Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We will cover the Old Testament from Adam to Noah, then from Abraham to Joseph, then from Moses to Samuel, and then from Samuel to David.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After we cover all the kings, we will come to the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What we cover will be not just some Bible knowledge and history.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the sections are full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You probably have never heard many of these things before.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, you must not only bring others to these meetings, but you yourselves must pay attention to all the points.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you do this, in half a year all the brothers and sisters will have gone through twenty-four lessons and will have received a very adequate spiritual education.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we finish forty-eight lessons, we will have covered a year s course.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way, year after year, in four year s time this spiritual education will become very prevalent among us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>DIVING INTO GOD S WORD FULL-TIME</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In addition, every Lord s Day evening after the Lord s table meeting, we will reserve half an hour for the release or reading of a message on life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every Tuesday after our prayer meeting, we will also reserve half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The points we cover at that time will not be mainly on life but will be mainly on service, on the spiritual principles of service in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord s Day morning is on one line, covering the truth education.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord s Day evening is on another line, on life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Tuesday evening is on the line of service.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then there is the line of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In addition to this there is the line of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Altogether there are five lines.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we go on in these five lines, we will find out that there are not many who can be faithful to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need brothers who can minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For this reason we have made the decision to have the full-time co-workers go back to the different meeting halls to concentrate on the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They will take the lessons we wrote and distribute them to the various classes in the various meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then they also have to find a message on life for the Lord s Day evening meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They also have to find a message on service for the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They must also mark out the portions for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Unfortunately, we cannot find twenty-one co-workers to labor full-time in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is why I encourage you elders to give up your jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The study of God s word requires your whole being to be given.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It requires your whole time and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Fifty-three years ago I gave up my job to labor full-time in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If my last fifty-three years were spent in my job, not only would it be impossible to produce all the volumes of Life-study messages, but I do not think I would have been able to produce even ten books.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>During the last fifty-three years I spent all my time in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Over and over I dig, I read, I study, and I write.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>On the English side, there are at least three thousand messages that are already in print.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>On the Chinese side, we have even more.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All these require time.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>EXERCISING TO PRAY, READ, SING, AND SPEAK</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>GOD S WORD IN OUR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In conclusion, the key to the home meetings is prayer, reading, singing, and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We cannot wait till the meeting time comes before we do all these four.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All the brothers and sisters must exercise in their daily lives to pray, read, sing, and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must exercise much in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The more we pray, the more we will be freed from all earthly affairs and will be brought into the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When we pray-read, we will also spontaneously sing.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The brothers and sisters should buy some song tapes and play them every day at home.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>While the brothers are driving, they should play them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>While the sisters are doing housework, they should also play them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Everyone should learn to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In this way it will be easy for us to sing hymns in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we combine our praying, reading, and singing together, the result will be our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The husbands will speak to the wives.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The wives will speak to the children.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Everyone will speak to his colleagues, and everyone will speak to his neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Whenever we come together, we will simply speak to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>May the Lord raise up some people in every home meeting to give a strong and weighty ten-minute word at the end of every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I hope that after a period of time, this will be fully realized among us.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I believe that this is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If a church is rich in truth and strong in the ministry of life, it will surely grow, and the number will surely increase.</S>
