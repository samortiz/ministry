By Eating the Bread</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) To Enjoy the Lord as Our Life Supply</H2><P>In John 6:35a the Lord told us that He is the bread of life, so to eat the bread is to enjoy the Lord as our life supply. Breaking the bread does not imply any enjoyment, but eating the bread surely does.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) To Testify That We Live by the Lord</H2><P>We also eat the bread to testify that we live by the Lord. In John 6:57b the Lord said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me." By eating the bread we indicate that we enjoy the Lord and we testify that this is our way to live. This is the real remembrance of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) To Have Fellowship in Christ's Mystical Body</H2><P>The next crucial point concerning our remembrance of the Lord is our eating the bread to enjoy the fellowship in Christ's mystical Body. The breaking of the bread mainly implies the Lord's physical body broken for us on the cross. Eating the bread, which is to take in the bread, mainly implies the fellowship in the mystical Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:16b-17). The same bread, the same loaf on the table, signifies the physical body of Christ and the mystical Body of Christ. The Lord's physical body was broken on the cross for our redemption, and the Lord's mystical Body, the Body of Christ, is for our fellowship. Regarding the Lord's physical body, we break the bread, and regarding His mystical Body, we eat the bread. Eating together means communion, fellowship. A part of the same bread gets into you, a part gets into me, and a part gets into each one of us. This is the oneness in the Body in the fellowship of the Body.</P><P>We need to spend time on this point, especially for the sake of the new ones and young ones among us. First, the bread on the table signifies the Lord Jesus' physical body He gave for us on the cross. This is the bread which we break. Second, the bread also signifies the Lord's mystical Body, which is composed of all the saved believers. When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He was a grain of wheat (John 12:24). But today He is no longer merely a single grain of wheat. He is the bread composed of the many grains, including Himself. Thus, to eat the bread implies that we are participating in the mystical Body of Christ, comprising all the saints, that is, we are fellowshipping with all the saints universally from ancient times until today. We need to see that the remembrance of the Lord at His table implies His redemption, His Body, and His entire New Testament economy.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
