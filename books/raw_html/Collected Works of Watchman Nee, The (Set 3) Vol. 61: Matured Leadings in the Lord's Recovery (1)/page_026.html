<h1 class="series">MEETINGS, CONFERENCES, AND<br />PRIVATE FELLOWSHIPS,<br />FEBRUARY 2&mdash;MARCH 11, 1950</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">A TALK WITH CO-WORKERS</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:February 2, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />REVIVAL AND HANDING ONESELF OVER</h2><p>When I came to Hong Kong this time, I felt unhappy about the lack of advancement in the church here. During the past decade war was raging everywhere, but Hong Kong has been affected by it very little. Yet today there are only one to two hundred saints in Hong Kong. The flame of war has not touched this place, but neither does it seem as if the flame of revival has either. I am a little disappointed about the progress of revival in Hong Kong.</p><p>We have to be clear that in order for the church to have a revival, it has to follow God's ordained laws. There are laws behind everything in the universe. All creatures are after their kind (Gen. 1:24). Even sin and death has its law (Rom. 8:2). There are also laws governing revival. According to my observation, the problems lie solely with the co-workers. In order for the church to be revived, our co-workers must be first revived. They can then influence the leading brothers and eventually all the brothers and sisters. How can we be revived? The way is to hand ourselves over. The co-workers must first hand themselves over; they must take the lead to consecrate themselves.</p><p>The degree of our consecration is based on the amount of light we have received. The amount of shining we receive determines the extent of consecration we render. In this aspect the elders should not fall behind the young ones; they should not be behind in consecration. Admittedly, the older brothers and sisters may not be able to match the young people in evangelism, zeal, or energy, but they should not say that they cannot match the young people in consecration and love for the Lord. If they do, this is an admission that they have received less light and grace than the young people.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADERSHIP</h2><p>In God's church there is the eldership. Among God's workers there is the leadership. Many people think that these positions are determined by age and gift, but they are not determined by age or gift. They are determined by a man's consecration before God. The amount of consecration we maintain before God determines the degree of the manifestation of our position before Him. This manifestation is our only qualification to take the lead among the churches or the workers. Those who are willing to pay the price to deal with themselves will find that others have less of a need to deal with them. If we have God's light, we can take the lead and others will follow us; they will not rebel. Even though everyone has handed himself over, everyone's spiritual condition is different. If we are willing to cut ourselves deeper, the life that flows out will be richer, and others will receive more supply from us.</p><p>The extent to which we hand ourselves over will be the extent of the riches we receive from God. It will also be the extent to which we can render direction and help to others. J. N. Darby was an Anglican minister in 1825. By 1827 he gave up his clergy robe, and by 1831 he forsook all to follow the Lord. His obedience opened the floodgate to God's light. After him Kelly also forsook all to follow the Lord. When I was young, I received much help from Miss Groves who also forsook everything to follow the Lord. Today we should not broaden the narrow gate. We should not be like the Pharisees, who closed off the gate to the kingdom of the heavens, yet they would not go in themselves and would not allow others to go in either (Matt. 23:13).</p>
