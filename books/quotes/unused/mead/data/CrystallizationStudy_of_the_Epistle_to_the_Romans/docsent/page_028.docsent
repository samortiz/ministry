   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Epistle to the Romans Message Nine The Structure of the Gospel of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Righteousness of God, the Life of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and the Faith of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>5 The Essence of the Faith of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3 Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20b; 2 Cor 5:7; Luke 18:8; Heb 12:2; 1 Tim 1:4b; Eph 3:17a; Rom 1:17a; Gen 15:6; Heb 11:6c; 2 Cor 4:12-13; Heb 4:16;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rom 10:12; 2 Tim 2:22; Eph 6:17-18 OUTLINE The faith of the believers: The believers live Christ by this faith as defined in the preceding items , the faith of Christ, the Son of God Gal 2:20b.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The believers walk and suffer persecution by this faith 2 Cor 5:7; Luke 18:8.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The believers need to look away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of their faith Heb 12:2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The eternal economy of God is in such a faith 1 Tim 1:4b; Eph 3:17a.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The righteousness of God is revealed out of such a faith and to such a faith in the gospel of God Rom 1:17a.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a faith is the initial righteousness of the believers before God Gen 15:6 , and God rewards those who seek Him in such a faith Heb 11:6c .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The believers speak for the Lord, speak the Lord forth, and speak the Lord into people by such a faith 2 Cor 4:12-13.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The way to receive such a faith is to contact its source, the Lord, the processed and consummated God, by calling on Him, praying to Him, and pray-reading His word Heb 4:16; Rom 10:12; 2 Tim 2:22; Eph 6:17-18.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Prayer: Dear Lord, we are happy to give You thanks for bringing us into such a high level.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, here we can see something marvelous, something excellent, something that will surprise us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, release Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is all that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need only You as the great I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the previous message we pointed out Hymns, #535 by Charles Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I like his hymns very much, but I had never paid much attention to this hymn until recently.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a wonderful line in stanza 5 which says, Let me no longer live, but Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is marvelous that such a line is in this hymn on faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Faith is to believe that God is, and I am not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do believe that Charles Wesley must have noticed this point.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, how could he have said in his hymn: Let me no longer live, but Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Faith always annuls us and reveals Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this message we are still on the structure of the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all have seen clearly that this divine structure is of three parts: the righteousness of God, the life of Christ, and the faith of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The structure of God s gospel is first the judicial part.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The righteousness of God is a matter of judicial standing related to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then the life of Christ, which is organic, is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The third part, the faith of the believers, is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a matter of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regardless of how much the righteousness of God and the life of Christ are in this universe, without the faith of the believers, nothing can happen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The righteousness of God is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is judicial, fulfilling all the requirements of God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The righteousness of God as a part of God s salvation makes God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is satisfied and joyful because His righteousness has judicially fulfilled all the legal requirements of the divine law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the life of Christ organically is the completion of God s salvation for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ expressed as the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if there is no faith of the believers, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So it is the faith of the believers that links God s righteousness and Christ s life with us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At one time we were unbelieving sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we heard the gospel and repented, we spontaneously called on the name of the Lord: O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By calling on the Lord, the linking faith got into us that linked us, the great sinners, with the righteousness of God and with the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we became altogether another person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I still remember my conversion when I was at the end of my nineteenth year of age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I was born into, raised up, and educated in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I had heard much preaching and teaching about the Bible, though I was not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But one afternoon I heard the gospel, and within a few hours I was a changed person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Actually, it was the linking faith that changed me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that time from my sincere heart, from the depths of my being, I cried to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That was the faith which had been imparted into me as my believing element, which linked me with the marvelous God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Faith is the linking of our salvation that links God with us and links us to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This linking makes us the God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was a sinner, an enemy of God, but I became a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is because something linked into me, linked with me, and linked me to God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That was faith.</S>
