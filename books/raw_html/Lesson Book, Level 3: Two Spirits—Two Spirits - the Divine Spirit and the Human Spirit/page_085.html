<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Express God Fully for Eternity</H2><P>[Such a composition of the Triune God with His redeemed people will express God fully for eternity (Rev. 21:11a). So at the end of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</P><P>Now we can see why John says that the Son comes in the Father's name, and the Spirit comes in the Son's name. In his Gospel John prepares the way to show us that these three&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;are not separate. These three actually are one. The source, the expression, and the entering in become the consummation. The Spirit is not separated from the Son nor from the Father. The Spirit is the consummation of the entire Triune God. The Spirit as the Bridegroom is the totality and consummation of the Triune God. He is qualified to be such a husband to marry the wife, who is the consummation of all the redeemed and regenerated people of God. This is a universal couple with divinity marrying humanity.</P><P>Here are two consummations. Divinity has gone through a process&#151;through incarnation, through crucifixion, through resurrection, and through ascension&#151;to become the Spirit, the totality, the consummation, of the Triune God to be the Bridegroom. Humanity also has gone through a process&#151;through redemption, through regeneration, and through transformation&#151;to become the consummation of God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. The consummation of the Triune God and the consummation of God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people become one in a universal marriage. The processed man will match the processed God forever for His full expression and satisfaction.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>The processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit dispenses Himself into man and mingles with man to produce the church. Because the Spirit is the reality of Christ, the more we are mingled with the Spirit, the more we become the embodiment of Christ. We also become the lampstands shining with the sevenfold intensified Spirit in a dark age as the testimony of Jesus. The mingling eventually consummates in the New Jerusalem, where the Spirit as the Bridegroom and the church as the bride are joined in a universal marriage. The New Jerusalem as the consummate issue of the Triune God dispensed into man will express the Triune God for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>What does "consummate issue" mean?</li><li>How does the Triune God mingle Himself with man to produce the church?</li><li>How do the golden lampstands in Revelation 1 show us that the churches are the embodiment of Christ and the reproduction of the Spirit?</li><li>Since the New Jerusalem is not a physical city, what does it symbolize?</li><li>What do the gold, pearl, and precious stones signify in the New Jerusalem?</li><li>Regarding the universal marriage in Revelation:	<ol class="lower-alpha">	<li>Who is the Bridegroom?</li>	<li>Who is the bride?</li>	<li>What is the process that the Bridegroom has gone through?</li>	<li>What is the process that the bride has gone through?</li>	</ol></li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Life-study of Ephesians, p. 573.</li><li>Life-study of Revelation, pp. 85-86, 93, 99.</li><li>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity, pp. 41-44.</li></ol>
