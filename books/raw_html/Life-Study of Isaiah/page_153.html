<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Israel to Be the Priests of Jehovah,<br>and the Gentiles to Be the Laborers to Israel</H2><P>In the restoration Israel will be priests of Jehovah, the ministers of their God, and the Gentiles will be the laborers to serve Israel (Isa. 61:4-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Israel to Exult in Jehovah Her God</H2><P>Verses 10 and 11 say, "I will rejoice greatly in Jehovah, / My soul will exult in My God; / For He has clothed Me with the garments of salvation, / He has wrapped Me with the robe of righteousness; / I am like a bridegroom who wears the headdress of the priest, / And like a bride who adorns herself with her jewels. / For as the earth brings forth its sprout, / And as the garden causes the things sown in it to spring up, / So will the Lord Jehovah cause righteousness and praise / To spring up before all the nations." These verses indicate that Israel will exult in Jehovah her God with the enjoyment of His salvation and righteousness. Israel will realize that God's righteousness has brought in His salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Zion to Shine Forth Righteousness<br>and to Show Forth Salvation</H2><P>In the restoration Zion will shine forth righteousness and will show forth salvation as God's crown of beauty and delight (62:1-5). Because during the restoration righteousness will be dispensed, transfused, into the Jews, they will shine forth righteousness. Also they will show forth salvation as God's crown of beauty and delight. Their shining forth will be such a crown to God. God will be beautified by and will be happy and satisfied with what Israel will shine forth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jerusalem to Be Established<br>and Made a Praise in the Earth</H2><P>Jerusalem will be established and made a praise in the earth (vv. 6-9). The whole earth will praise Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Salvation to Come to the Daughter of Zion</H2><P>Salvation will come to the daughter of Zion, and the people will be called the holy people, the redeemed of Jehovah (vv. 10-12).</P>
