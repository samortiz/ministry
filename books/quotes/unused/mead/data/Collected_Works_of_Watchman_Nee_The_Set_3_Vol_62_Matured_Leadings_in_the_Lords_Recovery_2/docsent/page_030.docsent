   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE THE CHRISTIAN PATHWAY Date: Evening, February 23, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Jordan Road, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speakers: Watchman Nee, Witness Lee KEEPING ONE'S SECRET COVENANT BEFORE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Watchman Nee: When John Wesley married in his twenties, he made a secret covenant with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was the only time he adjusted the standard of his living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before he was married, he was called to the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Later, he went full-time to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From that time until his death, he never changed the standard of his living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After his death, others listed his income.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His earning in later years did increase.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every year he earned ten to twenty thousand pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both he and his brother Charles were songwriters, and they had income from royalties.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The year before he died he earned the most over twenty thousand pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But he maintained the same standard of living throughout.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of his excess was spent on the gospel, on literature, and on tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also offered what he had for the Lord's work by training more people and sending them out for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the brothers and sisters who are in business, who hold jobs, or who are housewives at home should have a list.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They have to make a vow before the Lord as to the standard of living they want to maintain.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once they have set the standard, they have to maintain it with an unfeigned conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They should not regret later and say, "I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do not have the faith or the resources, etc."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only must the husband and the wife discuss among themselves, but the two must go to the Lord together to seek His will and to make a covenant with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One brother in Fukien has set a limit of four dollars per month for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many brothers have praised him for this, but I say that this was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need to mortify ourselves or purposely starve or freeze ourselves to death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If this brother continues this way, he will get sick one day and have to spend even more money on himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many brothers and sisters are very smart when it comes to their money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are very clever, but they do not understand a thing about spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some people have no spiritual understanding before they consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But once they hand themselves over, their spiritual understanding is enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we should not underestimate the practice of a secret covenant before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To the world, forsaking everything to follow the Lord is a reckless act.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this is only one small part of a Christian's overall service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our career, body, time, and future must also be consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will not make public the lists that the brothers and sisters have handed over to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are a means for the responsible brothers to get to know you and render proper help to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some people may be offering too little.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Others may be offering too much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The responsible brothers can render help according to your list.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE REAL CHRISTIAN STANDARD</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>WALKING ACCORDING TO</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE DEMAND OF CHRIST WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Witness Lee: I have often thought that God's love is very much misunderstood by man, but Christianity is also very much misunderstood by man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Bible there is no such term as Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible only says that individual believers are Christians, and the whole Body of believers is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no such term as Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A Christian is one who believes in the Lord and who possesses His life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many brothers and sisters have become Christians, but they do not know what it means to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we ask a Christian what a Christian is, many will give strange answers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Someone may answer, "As long as a man has Christ and His life, he is a Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even this answer is not easy to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may say this with our mouth, but we are not this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One day when God opens our eyes, we will know what a Christian is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today it is as rare to find a person who knows what a Christian is as it is to find the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is a Christian in man's concept and view?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some think that a Christian is one who follows the teachings and creeds of Christianity, attends Sunday morning service, and tithes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Strictly speaking, being a Christian has nothing to do with these outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christianity is not a religion or a teaching based on the Bible; it is not to zealously practice teachings that are based on the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christians are those who pay attention to the inward things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They pay attention to the things that are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A Christian is one who is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This may sound objective, abstract, or general.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let me put it another way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A Christian is one in whom Christ dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today you are a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On what standard do you practice your Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Does Christian conduct consist solely of keeping ordinances?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Is his standard merely the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to say, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Let me ask Miss Nee, "Do you take the teachings, slogans, and beliefs of No. 7, Jordan Road as your standard of Christian life?" She shakes her head.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Brother Ma, what would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brother Weigh answers, "According to the demand of the Christ within us."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There are two answers.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One is to act according to the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The other is to act according to the sense of the inward leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some say that a Christian is one who imitates Christ, but it is not easy to imitate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not a matter of seeing Christ jump in front of us and copying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The genuine experience of a Christian is not outward; it comes from within.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although we may have outward activities occasionally, the source of these activities must come from within.</S>
