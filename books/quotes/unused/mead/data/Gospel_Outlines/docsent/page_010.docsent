   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Nine LIFE VERSUS GOOD AND EVIL Scripture: Gen 2 Two trees Mention that after God created man, He put him in front of two trees, and that He held him responsible for these two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whether man would be a success or a failure, right or wrong, legal or illegal, was all dependent upon how he would deal with those two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The tree of life depicts God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God made man, He gave man a life for his human existence, but God did not give him His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So after man was made, man had only man s life, not God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God intended that man would, by his own free will, choose God s life and receive His life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God used the tree of life to depict God s life, and God intended that man would contact the tree of life, that is, to contact God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as the tree of life depicts God s life, the tree of good and evil depicts Satan s life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God used these two trees to point out that He and Satan are opposite to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He wished that man would contact the tree of life and thus have a relationship with Him, and He wished that man would not contact the tree of good and evil and thus have a relationship with Satan, but He gave man a free will to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Life is God s goal God s goal for man is that man may have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Emphasize this point.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This life is God s life, and this life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Explain how God made man to be His vessel, so that He may pour Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When man gets this life, he is up to God s standard; he is no longer empty, but is living in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He becomes a man of meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Good and evil are Satan s purpose</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This point must be presented clearly; otherwise it is difficult for people with moral thinking to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Satan wanted to capture man, whom God had created for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way Satan captured man was to cause man to pay attention to good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As soon as man pays attention to good and evil, he is independent of God and becomes severed from God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To man there is a big difference between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All men condemn evil and justify good, but the ultimate result of either good or evil is but one: both good and evil result in independence from God and keep man from having God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only life is the true goodness The source of good is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should make people realize that all the evil originated from Satan, and all genuine goodness originated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is the source of all good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God s true goodness is touched through God s life because God is not only good, but much more, God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only when you touch God s life can you touch the true goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Any goodness not from God and God s life is only secondary goodness, if not false.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is never the genuine goodness or the highest goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This point should subdue the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Life is the power of goodness Satan causes men to pay attention to goodness, but he would not give them the power to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Anyone who tries to do good outside of God and without leaning on God, only has the knowledge of good, but has no power to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Chinese dictionary there are the words virtue and wisdom, and even the word wisdom-power, but not virtue-power.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This proves that the Chinese philosophers had discovered that men had the knowledge of good but lacked the power to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why the more a man pays attention to good, the more he discovers the lack of power to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you are sloppy, you hardly feel that you are powerless in doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is when you are trying to do good that you find out that you lack the power of doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since God Himself is the true goodness the highest goodness , God s power must be His life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only when a man receives God s life can he have the real goodness and the power to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So if you really want to do good, you must receive the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The way to receive life God s life is put in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Speak more about this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ died to redeem us, and resurrected to release His life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ s death took away the problem sins between men and God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Unless men s sins are taken away, God the real life cannot get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through death Christ dealt with our sins, and through resurrection Christ released His life for us to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must confess our sins, and repudiate our past ways and goals.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In addition, there are many other evils we need to confess from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must change our mind and turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As soon as we change our mind, we should pray and confess to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must open yourself from within, and accept Christ to come into your heart, to be your living Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Acknowledge that you have received this life because you believed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is according to the words of the Bible 1 John 5:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This message is suitable for speaking to the more intellectual ones.</S>
