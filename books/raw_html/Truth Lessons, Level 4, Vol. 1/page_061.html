<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Due to the fall, mankind&rsquo;s only expectation is death. All those who are apart from Christ have no hope and are without God in the world (Eph. 2:12). However, the believers&rsquo; life is full of hope, not only for the Lord&rsquo;s coming but also to be resurrected and to be raptured. When the Lord comes back, there will be resurrection and rapture, and He will set up His judgment seat in the air to judge His believers. Concerning the believers&rsquo; resurrection, rapture, and judgment in the future, the revelation in the New Testament is both clear and strong. In this lesson we shall see prophecies in the Bible concerning the believers&rsquo; resurrection, rapture, and judgment. All believers should be concerned with the truth revealed in these prophecies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE RESURRECTION OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The Christian life is closely related to resurrection. A believer experiences being raised up together with Christ at the time of his salvation; this is the resurrection of the spirit (John 5:25; Eph. 2:1, 5-6; Col. 2:13). Furthermore, a believer&rsquo;s hope for the future also depends on resurrection, that is, the resurrection of the body. Paul says, &ldquo;If it is only that we have hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most miserable&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:19). The Christian life is completely different from the life of fallen mankind, which is a life without hope. The hope of the Christian life depends on the resurrection brought in at the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Resurrection of Life</h2>
<p>John 5:28-29 says, &ldquo;Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice and will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment.&rdquo; These verses reveal two kinds of physical resurrections. One is the resurrection of life, that is, the resurrection of the saved believers before the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; 1 Cor. 15:23, 52; 1 Thes. 4:16). All dead believers will be resurrected at the return of the Lord Jesus to enjoy eternal life. Hence, this resurrection is called the resurrection of life. The resurrection of judgment refers to the resurrection of the unbelievers after the millennium (Rev. 20:5, 12). All the dead unbelievers will be resurrected after the millennium to be judged at the great white throne and to be sentenced to eternal perdition (vv. 11-15). Hence, this resurrection is called the resurrection of judgment. The resurrection of the believers is the resurrection of life, not the resurrection of judgment.</p>
