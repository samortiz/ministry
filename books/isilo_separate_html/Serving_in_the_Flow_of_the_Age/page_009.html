in the Churches</h2>
<p>Following the revival in the church in Shanghai, some co-workers and I were invited to Canton, Swatow, Amoy, and Foochow at the end of 1947. We arrived in Hong Kong at the end of December, and we left Hong Kong for Canton on January 1, 1948. Then we went to Swatow and arrived in Amoy in February. We reached Foochow by the end of February. Before our visit, none of the churches in the Fukien or Kwangtung Provinces were clear concerning the ground of the church. Although the first meeting outside denominations started in Foochow in 1922, none of the churches in the Fukien Province or in the neighboring Kwangtung Province were clear concerning the ground of the church in 1948. This lack of clarity was the result of these places receiving different opinions from other sources in addition to Brother Nee&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>When we had a conference in Foochow, twenty to thirty co-workers and responsible ones from around Foochow came. There was a little revival in Foochow as a result of this conference. After the conference many would not leave, because they heard that a few co-workers and I would be staying at Brother Nee&rsquo;s house for another two weeks in order to have some fellowship with him. When they learned of this, they would not leave, and they asked me to plead with Brother Nee to let them hear his fellowship.</p>
<p>Brother Nee did not agree with their coming to this further time of fellowship, but they would not leave. When I pleaded for them once again, Brother Nee, who had a large living room in his house with a partition wall on one side, said, &ldquo;You and the two co-workers with you can sit and fellowship with me on this side of the wall; the other twenty to thirty co-workers and responsible ones can sit on the other side of the wall and listen. Furthermore, you must guarantee that they will not go out and speak about what they have heard.&rdquo; I took the risk and gave my guarantee to Brother Nee. Only then did he agree.</p>
<p>Brother Nee did not want them to go out and loosely repeat his fellowship, because many co-workers and responsible ones in the local churches had not learned the lessons concerning the practice of the church life. Instead, they were opinionated, and Brother Nee did not want anything to be stirred up among those who held differing opinions by the casual repetition of his fellowship. After I gave my guarantee to him, I said to the twenty to thirty co-workers and responsible ones, &ldquo;You are willing to hear Brother Nee&rsquo;s fellowship, but he is concerned that you will go out and speak of it in a loose way. Therefore, you must not spread his speaking.&rdquo; They promised wholeheartedly to not say anything, because they were hungry and thirsty, and they realized their need for a spiritual supply.</p>
<p>It was really quite a special situation with four of us sitting together and the others sitting behind the partition. During one of these days of fellowship, I said to Brother Nee, &ldquo;When we visited the churches in the Kwangtung and Fukien Provinces, our general impression was that the churches were in a messy condition. What do you think should be done?&rdquo; This question seemingly opened up a fountainhead in him. When he opened his mouth, words that were full of the presence of the Holy Spirit poured out of him like Niagara Falls. This caused us to be quite fearful and sober. He spoke on the line of Jerusalem for a long time, and his speaking was filled with light, rebukes, and even remorse.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Co-working Being Possible<br />
Only through &ldquo;Handing Ourselves Over&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Upon hearing his speaking, an older sister said, &ldquo;Since we have heard Brother Nee&rsquo;s words, we should practice it,&rdquo; and everyone said Amen. Brother Nee responded, saying, &ldquo;If you really want to practice this, you must hand yourselves over completely starting from today. You need to go back and write a note concerning handing yourselves over.&rdquo; This was the beginning of our practice of &ldquo;handing ourselves over&rdquo; to be completely under the direction of the work. Brother Nee was very serious when he spoke of handing ourselves over. We had the sense that we were handing over our very life. If people do not hand themselves over, there is no possibility of co-working with one another.</p>
<p>Brother Nee spoke in this way because of our history and background. In the twenty-six years between 1922 and 1948, many differing opinions and views prevented Brother Nee from going forward. Our history has shown that those who had many opinions also had no light, no revelation, and no commission from God. Now our situation has changed; we can look back over our fifty years of history and see that God indeed entrusted Brother Nee with both light and vision. During that time, however, many opinions filled the sky with clouds and fog. Brother Nee wanted everyone to hand himself over so that there could be a way to go forward.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
