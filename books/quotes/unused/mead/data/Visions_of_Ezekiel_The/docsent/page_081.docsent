   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When to Offer</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Ezekiel's record there was the yearly offering, the monthly offering, the weekly offering, and the daily offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The yearly offering was offered on the first day of the year signifying that, in principle, every year we should have a new beginning 45:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every year we need a fresh cleansing and clearing up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With the yearly offering there was a gracious part.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The yearly offering was offered not only on the first day of the year, but also on the seventh day of the year 45:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicated a period of graciousness for the people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some were simply not ready on the first day of the year to fully clear up their situations and to be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the Lord gave them another opportunity on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If they missed the first day, they had the seventh day to make it up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Keep in mind that, in principle, at the beginning of every year, we need to have a renewal in our service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Though I do not want to present to you something legal, I would still like to share a testimony of my experience concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In past years, my co-workers and I practiced to have a new beginning every year.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On December 31, we spent the whole night together and prayed until the early hours of the first day of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>During the night we had a thorough dealing with the Lord, confessing all our shortcomings, and during the early morning of the first day of the year, we consecrated ourselves freshly to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is very good to have a new beginning on the first day of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was also the monthly offering at the time of the new moon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever the new moon came, the offering had to be made 46:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only do we need a new beginning yearly, but we also need a new beginning monthly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The new moon indicates a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Beyond this, we need a weekly offering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every week we need a fresh offering to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every week on the Sabbath the offering was made 46:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Sabbath means not only a new turn, but also that we are enjoying the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To keep the Sabbath means that we stop our work and enjoy what the Lord has done.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the principle of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we are not trusting in our work, but we are fully trusting and enjoying the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the meaning of keeping the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We always need to renew this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must be able to declare to the whole universe, "Our work has stopped and we are now enjoying the Lord's work!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, there was a daily offering 46:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This daily offering was different from the daily offering required by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moses said that the continual burnt offering should be in the morning and in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in Ezekiel there is no offering in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that in their serving, there is no evening; they are continually in the freshness of the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The situation in Ezekiel improved to the point that there was no more evening but only morning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There was no more sunset, but only sunrise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In addition to the yearly offerings, the monthly offerings, the weekly offerings, and the daily offerings, there were also the offerings at the appointed feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The record tells us that they offered at the time of the Passover, at the time of Unleavened Bread, and at the time of the Feast of Tabernacles 45:21, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah for all the offerings!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah for the Passover!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah for the tabernacle in fullness!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we know what kind of priests we must be in order to serve the Lord, and now we know what we have to offer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the real priest, and Christ is the real offering.</S>
