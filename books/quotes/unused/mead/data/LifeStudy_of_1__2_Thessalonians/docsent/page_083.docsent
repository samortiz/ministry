   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A RENEWED MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Romans 12:2 Paul speaks of the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the body represents our outward being, so the mind represents our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Romans 12:1, our body needs to be presented to God as a sacrifice, and our mind needs to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be renewed is to be saturated with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be renewed actually is to be sanctified, and to be sanctified is to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our mind needs to be renewed, sanctified, transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>AN EMOTION TOUCHED WITH THE LOVE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Ephesians 3:17 Paul says, "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, having been rooted and grounded in love."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Love is a matter of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to this verse, Christ makes His home in our hearts, and we ourselves become rooted and grounded in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that our emotion is touched by His love and that we grow in this love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To have our emotion filled with the love of Christ surely is an aspect of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, when we are rooted and grounded in love, we can "know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ" Eph 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is also related to the sanctification of our heart, in particular of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To have our emotion filled with the love of Christ is to be saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No doubt, this is the sanctification of our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>LOVING THE LORD WITH OUR WHOLE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mark 12:30 says, "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we have the heart, the soul, and the mind, with the soul mentioned in between the heart and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The three parts of the soul the mind, the emotion, and the will are also parts of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But why in Mark 12:30 is there no mention of the emotion or the will?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason is that the emotion and the will are included in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But why, then, is the mind mentioned?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The mind is mentioned because it is the leading part of both the heart and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we need to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mark 12:30 also tells us to love the Lord with all our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word "strength" here refers to our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we need to love the Lord with all our physical strength and with all our heart, soul, and mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that our entire being, our inner being and our outer being, should be occupied with the Lord our God and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is to be sanctified, made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE SPIRIT AND THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am burdened to point out that, as Christians, believers in Christ, we must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be a living believer involves both our spirit and our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Doctrinally, we may say that we can become living by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in practice often it seems that the exercise of our spirit does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many of us can testify that we have exercised our spirit, but still this did not always work to make us living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The reason the exercise of the spirit may not work is that the heart does not act.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that there is something wrong in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps the mind is not renewed, sanctified, transformed; it may not be saturated with the Lord and occupied by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, it may be filled with worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may exercise our spirit and say, "Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, this exercise may not work to make us living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The exercise of the spirit works only when our heart is active.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If our heart is dormant or asleep, exercising our spirit to call on the name of the Lord will not be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This exercise cannot work if our acting agent, our heart, is dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the reason we need to deal thoroughly with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This dealing must include our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our mind must be the mind of Christ, our emotion must be saturated with the love of Christ, and our will must be one with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If this is the condition of our heart, our heart will be active and functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then if we call on the Lord when our heart is active, this calling will be very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all need to look to the Lord to have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to pray, "Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I want to have my mind renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I want to have my emotion filled with Your love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I want to have a will that is truly one with Your will."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we have such a heart, then the heart as our acting agent will be established blameless in holiness, blameless in the state of being made holy.</S>
