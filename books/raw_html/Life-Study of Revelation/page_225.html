<h2 class="head2">C. Satan Being Cast into the Lake of Fire</h2><p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;And the Devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also the beast and the false prophet were; and they shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.&rdquo; The lake of fire is prepared for the Devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). However, the beast, the false prophet, and the &ldquo;goats&rdquo; in Matthew 25 will be cast into it a thousand years earlier than the Devil (19:20). After the thousand years, the Devil will be cast there also. After the millennium, the rebellious nature of mankind will be thoroughly purged, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire.</p><p>Not all the nations will participate in the last rebellion. Those citizens of the millennial kingdom who do not rebel against God will be transferred into the new heaven and the new earth to become the nations there. Revelation 21:24-27 speaks of the nations around the New Jerusalem. These nations will be fully purged of their rebellious nature. What a great clearance this will be! At the end of the millennium the immaturity of God&rsquo;s people will be eliminated, the rebellious nature of mankind will be purged, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire. Only the unbelieving dead, death and Hades, and the demons will still need to be dealt with. This will take place at the great white throne.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE JUDGMENT AT THE GREAT WHITE THRONE</h2><h2 class="head2">A. A Great White Throne Signifying That<br />the Judgment of the Lord There Is Righteous</h2><p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;And I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.&rdquo; White here signifies righteousness, indicating that the Lord&rsquo;s great throne for His judgment is righteous.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The One Sitting upon the Throne</h2><p>Christ is the One sitting upon the great white throne. The &ldquo;Him&rdquo; in verse 11 must be the Lord Jesus. God the Father &ldquo;has given all judgment to the Son&rdquo; (John 5:22) and has ordained Him to be the Judge of the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 17:31; 2 Tim. 4:1; Rom. 2:16). Matthew 25:31-46 speaks of the Lord as the Judge of the living before the millennium. Here, the Lord is the Judge of the dead after the millennium.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Earth and Heaven Fleeing Away</h2><p>Verse 11 says that earth and heaven will flee away from the face of the One on the throne and that no place will be found for them. The old heavens and the old earth will be changed (Heb. 1:11-12). The old heavens will pass away, the elements will melt, and the earth will be burned up (2 Pet. 3:10).</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Dead Unbelievers Being Judged</h2><p>Verse 12 says, &ldquo;And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by the things which were written in the books, according to their works.&rdquo; The word <i>standing</i> here indicates that the dead have been resurrected. This is the resurrection of the unbelievers, the resurrection of judgment, after the millennium (John 5:28-29; 1 Cor. 15:23-24). The unbelieving dead will be judged by the things written in the books, or scrolls (Gk.). These scrolls are the record of the works, the deeds, of the unbelievers, according to which they will be judged. The other book that is open, the book of life, is the record of the names of the believers (13:8; 17:8; Luke 10:20). The unbelievers will be judged by the things written in the books, according to their works. All they have said and done is written in these scrolls. In Matthew 12:36 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they shall render account concerning it in the day of judgment.&rdquo; Every idle word is recorded. The universal tape recorder records every word men say. At the great white throne the scrolls will be opened, and the Lord will say to the unbelieving dead, &ldquo;This is what you have said, and this is what you have done.&rdquo; Every mouth will be shut. God is God; He will take care of everyone.</p>
