Everything recorded in this chapter is a part of this aggregate sign. In this message we shall go on to consider more aspects of the sign in John 21.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FIRE</h2><p>John 21:9 says, &#8220;When they got out then onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread.&#8221; In the foregoing message we pointed out that this verse indicates the Lord&#8217;s ability to provide food for His disciples. Now we want to pay attention to the significance of the fire.<p>This fire must have been a reminder to Peter of the fire by which he was warming himself on the night he denied the Lord Jesus. Mark 14:54 says that Peter &#8220;was sitting with the deputies and warming himself in the light of the fire.&#8221; Here in chapter twenty-one the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to Peter, &#8220;The night I was betrayed and arrested, you were warming yourself by a fire when you denied Me. Now I have made a fire here in order to prepare food for you.&#8221; Do you not think that this fire served as a reminder to Peter of that other fire?<p>First, in John 21 Peter experienced the miracle concerning the abundance of fishes, and then he saw the fire. The miracle reminded Peter of the Lord&#8217;s calling of him three and a half years before, and the fire reminded him of his denying the Lord some days before. We should not think that the miracle of the fishes and the fire have no purpose. I believe that the Lord performed a miracle for the purpose of reminding Peter of His calling of him and also made a fire for the purpose of reminding Peter of his denying of Him.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S QUESTIONING OF PETER</h2><p>When Peter denied the Lord Jesus, he denied Him three times. Now in John 21 the Lord asked Peter three times, &#8220;Do you love Me?&#8221; (vv. 15-17). Verse 15 says, &#8220;Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&#8221; On the night Peter denied the Lord, he said to Him, &#8220;Even if all shall be stumbled, yet I will not!&#8221; (Mark 14:29). Here in John 21 the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying to Peter, &#8220;Do you love Me more than the other disciples do? You should remember your word spoken on the night I was betrayed. You told Me that even if all the others would fall away, you would not be stumbled. Eventually, Peter, you were the one who denied Me. Now I ask you this question: Do you love Me more than all these?&#8221; To be sure, this question was a reminder of what Peter had done on the night he denied the Lord Jesus.<p>In 21:15-17 two different Greek words are used for love: agapao and phileo. Agapao denotes a love which is higher and nobler than phileo. In verse 15, agapao is used in the Lord&#8217;s question, and phileo is used in Peter&#8217;s answer. This indicates that Peter did not dare to say that he loved the Lord Jesus with a higher, nobler love. In verse 16 agapao is again used in the Lord&#8217;s question, and phileo is used in Peter&#8217;s reply. Then in verse 17 phileo is used both for the question asked by the Lord Jesus and the answer given by Peter. This verse says, &#8220;He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me? Peter was grieved that He said to him the third time, Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.&#8221; Here Peter seems to be saying, &#8220;Lord, when I boasted that I would not be stumbled because of You, I was full of self-confidence. You told me that I would deny You three times, and this happened, just as You said it would. Lord, You know everything. You know that I love You.&#8221;<p>I do not believe that Peter was at peace when the Lord was questioning him. He was very troubled by the Lord&#8217;s questions, and he may have felt like covering his face. Instead of giving Peter a long message, the Lord set up a fire as a reminder to him. Then He fed him and questioned him concerning his love for Him.<p>Even though the Lord did not question Peter until the disciples had eaten breakfast, I find it hard to believe that Peter enjoyed that breakfast very much. As he was eating, the fire must have reminded him of that other fire. Immediately after breakfast, the Lord began to question Peter. The Lord&#8217;s third question bothered him very much. In his answer Peter seemed to be saying, &#8220;Lord, You don&#8217;t need me to tell You whether or not I love You. Even if I say that I love You, I am not able in myself to fulfill my word. But whatever You say, Lord, will be fulfilled.&#8221; Here also Peter was being trained by the Lord Jesus.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_225.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_227.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 226</div><br></body></html>
