   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Perhaps some may ask why God has such a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is because an angel of light rebelled against God before man's creation and became the devil: Satan sinned and fell; the Daystar became the enemy of God Isa 14:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God, therefore, withdrew His authority from the enemy and put it, instead, into the hand of man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reason God created man is that man may rule in the place of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What abounding grace we see in God's creation of man!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not only does God desire that man should rule, but He marks out a specific area for man to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We see this in Genesis 1:26: "Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth..."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"All the earth" is the domain of man's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only did God give man dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, and the cattle, but He further required that man should rule over "all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The area where God desired man to rule is the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man is especially related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only in His plan to create man was God's attention focused upon the earth, but after God made man, He clearly told him that he was to rule over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 27 and 28 say, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it..."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What God emphasized here is that man should "replenish the earth" and "subdue it"; it is of secondary importance that man should have dominion over the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air, and every living thing on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man's dominion over these other things is an accessory; the main subject is the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Genesis 1:1-2 says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two verses are made more clear by translating them directly from the Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the original language, verse one says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The heavens here are plural in number and refer to the heavens of all the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The earth has its heaven, and so do all the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The direct translation of verse two is: "And the earth became not "was" waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Hebrew, preceding "the earth" there is the conjunction "and."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"; there were no difficulties, no problems, but then something happened: "and the earth became waste and void."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "was" in Genesis 1:2 "And the earth was waste and void" and the word "became" in Genesis 19:26, where Lot's wife became a pillar of salt, are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lot's wife was not born a pillar of salt; she became a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The earth was not waste and void at the creation, but later became waste and void.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God created the heavens and the earth, but "the earth became waste and void."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This reveals that the problem is not with the heavens but with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We see then that the earth is the center of all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God contends for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus taught us to pray, "Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth" Matt 6:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the meaning of the original language, the phrase "as in heaven, so also on earth" is common to all three clauses, not only to the last clause.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, the original meaning is: "Your name be sanctified, as in heaven, so also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Your kingdom come, as in heaven, so also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This prayer reveals that there is no problem with "heaven"; the problem is with the "earth."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the fall of man, God spoke to the serpent, "Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life" Gen 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This meant that the earth would be the serpent's sphere, the place upon which he would creep.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The realm of Satan's work is not heaven, but earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the kingdom of God is to come, then Satan must be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If God's will is to be done, it must be done on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God's name is to be sanctified, it must be sanctified on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the problems are on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Two words in Genesis are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One is "subdue" in Genesis 1:28, which can also be translated "conquer."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The other is "keep" in Genesis 2:15, which can also be translated "guard."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We see from these verses that God ordained man to conquer and guard the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's original intention was to give the earth to man as a place to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was not His intention that the earth would become desolate Isa 45:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God desired, through man, to not allow Satan to intrude upon the earth, but the problem was that Satan was on earth and intended to do a work of destruction upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, God wanted man to restore the earth from Satan's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Another matter we need to note is that God required man, strictly speaking, not only to take back the earth, but also the heaven which is related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Scripture there is a difference between "heavens" and "heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The "heavens" are where the throne of God is found, where God can exercise His authority, while "heaven" in the Scriptures sometimes refers to the heaven which is related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is this heaven which God also wants to recover see Rev 12:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some may ask: Why doesn't God Himself cast Satan into the bottomless pit or the lake of fire?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our answer is: God can do it, but He does not want to do it Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not know why He will not do it Himself, but we do know how He is going to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God wants to use man to deal with His enemy, and He created man for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God wants the creature to deal with the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He wants His creature man to deal with His fallen creature Satan in order to bring the earth back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The man whom He created is being used by Him for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let us read Genesis 1:26 again: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth..."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It seems that the sentence is finished here, but another phrase is added: "...and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Here we see that the creeping things occupy a very great position, for God spoke of it after He finished mentioning "all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The implication is that in order for man to have dominion over all the earth, the creeping things must not be overlooked, for God's enemy is embodied in the creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The serpent in Genesis 3 and the scorpions in Luke 10 are creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Not only is there the serpent, representing Satan, but also scorpions, representing the sinful and unclean evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The domain of both the serpent and the scorpion is this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The problem is on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, we must distinguish the difference between the work of saving souls and the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many times the work of saving souls is not necessarily the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Saving souls solves the problem of man, but the work of God requires that man exercise authority to have dominion over all things created by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God needs an authority in His creation, and He has chosen man to be that authority.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we were here just for ourselves as mere men, then all our seeking and longing would be to love the Lord more and to be more holy, more zealous, and save more souls.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All of these pursuits are good indeed, but they are too man-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These things are concerned simply with the benefit of man; God's work and God's need are entirely neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must see that God has His need.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We are on this earth not merely for man's need but even more for God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Thank God that He has committed the ministry of reconciliation to us, but even if we have saved all the souls in the whole world, we have not yet accomplished God's work or satisfied God's requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Here is something called God's work, God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When God created man, He spoke of what He needed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He revealed His need to have man rule and reign over all His creation and proclaim His triumph.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Ruling for God is not a small thing; it is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God needs men whom He can trust and who will not fail Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is God's work, and this is what God desires to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We do not lightly esteem the work of gospel preaching, but if all our work is just preaching the gospel and saving souls, we are not causing Satan to suffer fatal loss.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If man has not restored the earth from the hand of Satan, he has not yet achieved God's purpose in creating him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Saving souls is often only for the welfare of man, but dealing with Satan is for the benefit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Saving souls solves man's need, but dealing with Satan satisfies God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Brothers and sisters, this requires us to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We know how the demons can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A demon once said, "Jesus I know of, and with Paul I am acquainted; but who are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Acts 19:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When a demon meets us, will he flee or not?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Preaching the gospel demands that we pay a price, but a much greater price must be paid to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is not a matter of a message or a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This requires our practice, and the price is extremely great.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we are to be men whom God will use to overthrow all of Satan's work and authority, we must obey the Lord completely and absolutely!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In doing other work it matters less if we preserve ourselves a little, but when dealing with Satan, we cannot leave one bit of ground for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We may hold on to something of ourselves in our study of the Scriptures, in preaching the gospel, in helping the church or the brothers, but when we are dealing with Satan, self must be utterly abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Satan will never be moved by us if self is preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>May God open our eyes to see that His purpose demands that we be wholly and absolutely for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>A double-minded person can never deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>May God speak this word to our hearts.</S>
