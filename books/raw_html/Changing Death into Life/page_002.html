        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FIRST SIGN&mdash;<br />
CHANGING DEATH INTO LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 2:1-11</h1>
<p>John 2:1-11 says, &ldquo;The third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. And Jesus also was invited, as well as His disciples, to the wedding. And when the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine. And Jesus said to her, Woman, what do I have in this that concerns you? My hour has not yet come. His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do. Now there were six stone waterpots lying there, according to the Jews&rsquo; rite of purification, holding two or three measures each. Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And He said to them, Draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast. And they took it to him. And when the master of the feast tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it came from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is worse; you have kept the good wine until now. This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed into Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gospel of John speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God coming to people so that they may have His life. Although the Lord Jesus contacted thousands of people when He was on the earth, John selected specific cases to prove that in order to meet all man&rsquo;s needs the Lord Jesus causes man to have His life. The event recorded in this portion of John 2 is one of many cases. It is an important and central case that has much significance. This case shows how the Lord Jesus came to change man&rsquo;s condition of death into one of life.</p>
<p>We will consider the record in John 2:1-11 point by point. This portion is symbolic in meaning. Hence, we must consider the symbolic meaning of the things and matters referred to in this portion. The case recorded in John 2 uses physical things to signify a spiritual reality. Therefore, in reading or speaking about this portion of the Bible, we must consider all the items as symbols with spiritual realities.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD COMING IN RESURRECTION TO PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The first point reveals the Lord Jesus coming in resurrection. The Lord Jesus came to a place called Cana on the third day (v. 1). In the Bible the third day is the day of resurrection, because the Lord Jesus resurrected on the third day. Therefore, the symbolic meaning of His coming to Cana on the third day is that He comes to people in resurrection. Chapter 1 presents the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God who bore our sins (vv. 29, 36). As the Lamb of God, the Lord Jesus bore our sins when He was put to death on the cross. Therefore, symbolically, chapter 1 speaks of the Lord Jesus coming as the Lamb of God to die for us on the cross for our redemption. Chapter 2 speaks of His being raised on the third day after His death and thereby entering into resurrection. His entering into resurrection means that He is the Lord of life, who is full of life, and that as the Spirit of life He can enter into people so that they may have His life. Therefore, this portion says that the Lord came to Cana on the third day. After dealing with man&rsquo;s sins through His death, He comes as the Spirit of life in resurrection to people so that they may have His life.</p>
<p>The ancient sages and philosophers knew that there is an immense need within human life, but they were not able to identify this need. They tried to meet this need with many different things, but all their efforts were fruitless because they did not know that this need can be met only by a sufficient life. Man has problems and difficulties because the human life is insufficient. Therefore, in the Gospel of John when the Lord Jesus comes in resurrection to man, He comes in the Spirit of life so that His sufficient life can solve the problems of human life and meet the needs of man&rsquo;s insufficient life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD COMING TO THE LOW PLACE<br />
WHERE PEOPLE ARE</h2>
<p>The Lord comes to people in their lowly condition. In John 2:1 the Lord came to Galilee. Galilee was a province, and it was considered a low, despised, and detested place. No prophet or man of fame had arisen out of Galilee (7:52). Galilee signifies a lowly place, a place of no reputation. In God&rsquo;s eyes all human beings are in Galilee, a place without honor, a place that is low and mean. The Lord&rsquo;s coming to Galilee means that He humbled Himself, leaving His glorious position in heaven and coming to a low and mean place on earth. The Lord humbled Himself and came to earth because He wanted to contact people so that they may receive Him as their life. If He were high and far above in the heavens, the lowly people living on earth would have no way to contact Him, nor would they have a way to receive Him as life. It is impossible for people to go to heaven, which is high and far above. It is possible, however, for the Lord to come down from heaven in order to approach those who are in a low and mean place. The Lord came from heaven to the earth in order to approach man. He died, resurrected, and ascended to heaven, and descended again as the Spirit of resurrection, the Spirit of life, the Holy Spirit, in order to seek and approach lowly people. To this day He is still searching every corner of the earth, in low and mean places, in order to contact lowly people. As the Spirit, He can approach and contact people in any nation and in any society, and He can be received by them to become their life.</p>
<p>Most people have a wrong concept that someone who wants to seek the Lord Jesus and pray to Him must go to a chapel, because the holy Savior can be found only in a sacred and solemn place. This concept may seem pious and good, but it is wrong and not according to the Bible. The Gospel of John shows that the resurrected Lord Jesus is omnipresent. He is everywhere as the Spirit of resurrection life in order to seek and contact those who need Him. On the one hand, He is exceedingly holy and honorable, but on the other hand, He is willing and desirous to contact the most filthy and lowly of people. No one should think that he is too filthy or too low to contact the Lord Jesus. No one should say, &ldquo;I have committed too many sins, and I am living a filthy life. Why would the Lord Jesus be willing to save someone like me?&rdquo; The Lord Jesus came to Galilee, a low and mean place. He specifically came to a place condemned by men in order to save lowly people. No place is too low or mean for Him to visit. No one is too lowly to be saved. This is His great love and compassion. This is the great gospel.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
