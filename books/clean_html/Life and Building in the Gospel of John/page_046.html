<h2 class="head2">Filling Six Stone Waterpots with Water</h2>
<p>John 2:6-7 says, &ldquo;There were six stone waterpots lying there, according to the Jews&rsquo; rite of purification, holding two or three measures each. Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.&rdquo; The six stone waterpots signify the natural, created man. Man was created on the sixth day, and stone signifies the natural man. The rite of purification refers to moral regulations and ritualistic practices, such as teachings concerning self-cultivation, self-reform, and doing good deeds. The Lord told the servants to fill the waterpots with water. This means that the natural, created man contains only water, that is, death, because water here signifies death. Whatever we practice according to a &ldquo;rite of purification&rdquo; cannot solve our problem of death. Self-cultivation and moral perfection can only improve and educate dead men.</p>
<p>Self-cultivation and self-improvement can be likened to working on a corpse in a mortuary. In a mortuary a dead person is washed and make-up is applied so that he looks clean and nice; nevertheless, he is still dead. I would rather contact a living person who is filthy than a dead person who is clean and beautiful. A dead person has been defiled by death. This problem cannot be solved by any &ldquo;rite of purification.&rdquo; Man cannot change the water in stone waterpots into wine. Everything that is within man is death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Drawing Some Water Out<br />
and the Water Becoming Wine</h2>
<p>In solving the problem of death, the Lord Jesus told the servants to draw some of the water out and take it to the master of the feast (v. 8). This water was changed into wine. This was not a matter of calling the things not being as being but of changing death into life. People may teach morality, talk about love and justice, and seek moral perfection in human life in order to keep some &ldquo;rite of purification,&rdquo; but we must not forget that man is merely a stone waterpot containing the water of death. No matter how purified or well-behaved a person may be, the death in him cannot be changed into life. Only the Lord Jesus who comes to man in resurrection can change our death water into life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK BEING TO RESURRECT, NOT TO HEAL</h2>
<p>Few Christians know that the Lord Jesus has entered into us in order to change our death into life. Most Christians do not see this revelation, this vision. When a person feels that he is proud, he might pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me and make me humble.&rdquo; Such a prayer is according to a &ldquo;rite of purification&rdquo;; it will not change water into wine. A quick brother with an irritable temperament might ask the Lord to have mercy on him and to change his temperament to be one of meekness. However, this is not according to the Lord&rsquo;s salvation; it is according to a religious &ldquo;rite of purification.&rdquo; Another brother may feel that his casual attitude and speech are not proper, so he prays, &ldquo;Lord, please restrict and regulate me by sealing my mouth.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus does not come to answer such prayers. He does not ask us to keep a &ldquo;rite of purification.&rdquo; He wants to change our water into wine, that is, to change our death into life.</p>
<p>The cases of the dying son of the royal official in chapter 4, the man who had been sick for thirty-eight years in chapter 5, and Lazarus in chapter 11 are matters of changing death into life. The Lord does not merely heal man&rsquo;s sickness, which is to alter something; He changes death into life. Being quick and irritable is a sickness, just as being unrestrained, being presumptuous, and talking too much are also sicknesses. In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus did not heal sicknesses. The son of the royal official was sick and about to die (4:47). The Lord said a word, and his sickness was healed. However, the Lord did not say that the son was healed; rather, He said to the royal official, &ldquo;Your son lives&rdquo; (v. 50). The Lord does not make a bad person good; He only turns death into life. Making a bad person good is related to keeping a &ldquo;rite of purification,&rdquo; but changing water into wine is to change death into life.</p>
<p>A saint once said to me, &ldquo;Brother, I am very bad; what should I do?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;If we are merely bad, the Lord Jesus will not heal our badness. We must be dead and then the Lord Jesus will come to resurrect us. When Lazarus was sick, the Lord ignored him. The Lord did not come until Lazarus was dead, buried, and smelling. The Lord did not heal Lazarus&rsquo;s sickness. Rather, He changed death into life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we hate our irritable temperament and ask the Lord to make us gentle, He will not answer. Those who have experience will say that the Lord answers many prayers, but He does not answer prayers related to changing our temperament. Rather, the more we pray, the more we seem to lose our temper, because the Lord does not heal our sickness. He wants us to die so that we can be resurrected. When our eyes are opened, we will see that such prayers are religious prayers according to our own &ldquo;rite of purification.&rdquo; Such prayers do not ask the Lord to be our life or to change our death into life.</p>
<p>Some may say, &ldquo;If this is the case, how should we pray if we are irritable, presumptuous, arrogant, and unrestrained?&rdquo; It is best not to have a religious prayer. Instead of asking Him to do something, we can let Him shine in us. We contain water; we are full of death. Hence, we do not need Him to change our irritability to gentleness or our lack of restraint to good behavior, because the issue would still be water. Rather, we need to hand ourselves over to the Lord. Then He will bear the responsibility to change our death into life. This is a matter of seeing a vision and receiving revelation. We need not ask, beg, or request. We only need to say, &ldquo;Lord, within me is only water, only death.&rdquo; It is sufficient for us to see this. Then whatever people touch in us will be related to life.</p>
<p>The stone waterpots contained water, but wine was drawn out from them. When we give the Lord the ground in our being, we will see death in ourselves, but others will touch life in us. We should not pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am irritable; please make me meek. I am not well behaved; please make me willing to be restricted.&rdquo; Such a prayer is similar to Martha&rsquo;s prayer in chapter 11 and the prayer of Jesus&rsquo; mother in chapter 2. If we pray in this way, the Lord Jesus will say, &ldquo;What do I have in this that concerns you?&rdquo; He will reject such prayers. The more we pray in this way, the less He will move. We may say, &ldquo;Lord, come quickly! I am very sick,&rdquo; but He will say, &ldquo;I will come when you are dead.&rdquo; Just like the stone pots that were filled with water, the Lord always takes us to a place of death.</p>
<p>Some of the saints have reached this place. They have received revelation and seen the vision. They often have the sensation that they are stone waterpots filled with water. It is sufficient to see this. The Lord does not want to improve our situation or change us from being bad to being good. He desires to change the water within us into wine; He wants to change our death into life.</p>
<p>I hope that we will see this revelation, prostrate ourselves before the Lord, and say, &ldquo;Lord, I am a stone waterpot. All that is in me is death.&rdquo; Then the Lord can come to us in resurrection, and He will be responsible for changing our water into wine. He will change our death into life. The more we yield to Him, give Him the ground, acknowledge His authority, stop our activity, and see His salvation, the more thoroughly He will work in us. Then others will touch life in us. This is what the Lord desires to do in us. This is to change death into life. Our Lord has come in resurrection to fragile people in a lowly condition so that He can change death into life.</p>
