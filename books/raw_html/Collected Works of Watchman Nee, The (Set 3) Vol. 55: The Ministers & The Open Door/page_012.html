        <h2 class="head2">Lessons Learned in Siying</h2><p>In observing the children of God in Siying, I became conscious of the need to submit to the divine life and the importance of position and authority. If this matter is not upheld, the church will be in confusion, and nothing will be proper or orderly. When I was in Shanghai, often I was unwilling to submit to the older saints, and I was full of my own opinions. This greatly damaged the house of God. May God and you forgive me.</p><p>When I first came here, I was too "democratic"; I allowed the brothers to touch the affairs of the church too loosely. Thank God that my error has been exposed through practical lessons. Because some brothers knew too much about the matters in God's house, they became proud and had a bad attitude about receiving teaching. This confirms the word in 1 Timothy 3:6. You did not tell me much about church affairs when I was about to leave Shanghai; I realize now that this was really wise.</p><p>Some brothers and sisters do not have a heart for God because they have received too little grace. When I meet this kind of person, my heart aches to the extent that I cannot say anything. I dare not speak, and my attitude appears cold and hard. When others see me, they think that I am proud or that I do not want to speak with them. I am really in a dilemma and do not know what to do.</p><p>The senior Brother Chao once said to me that when Brother Witness gives a message, his words are strong and severe, but once he steps down from the platform, he is very open to receive the saints. I also remember that Brother Witness once told me that when one stands on the platform, he must be faithful to speak God's word. He should not be indecisive just because his brothers are sitting in the audience. But in his daily life, he must treat the brothers in a way they can bear. Sister Peace Wang also said in her letter that we should not be hasty in dealing with the brothers. The warm sun can cause dead branches to fall away. When I stood on the platform, I spoke a heavy word. Many brothers could not take it. Some were even repulsed. I fear that they did not have enough grace, even though they understood what was spoken. Consequently, they could not stand it. On the platform I rebuked the brothers for loving the world, and they felt that my standard was too high. They were unwilling to receive the word. Yet I did not have the peace unless I released this word, and I had nothing else to speak other than this.</p><p>This past Lord's Day, we had a baptism at the beach. (Six people were baptized&mdash;three brothers, two wives, and an elementary school student. A month before Brother Yen came, two brothers were baptized.) That evening we had the first Lord's table meeting with ten people in attendance. (All were brothers and sisters who had been baptized among us.) Those who had asked to be baptized spoke with us, the responsible brothers. They were accepted only after we consented. There were a few friends we felt that we could not accept, and we refused to baptize them.</p><p>We prefer to be very strict in order to preserve the holiness of the house of God. We do not baptize or accept people into the Lord's table meeting loosely.</p><p>The following week, we had four days of gospel meetings. Because there were a limited number of brothers, we could only do what our strength permitted. I dared not be too hopeful that many brothers would come into the church. I only hoped to make one payment on my debt of the gospel. As a result of this gospel preaching, I hoped our living before our colleagues would be dealt with more and that we would not be so loose.</p><p>I always feel that our immediate colleagues are the best candidates for the gospel. If this barrier is not broken down, we cannot hope to save friends outside of our office. (Oh, this is difficult because we must fight with all our strength and give up our rights.)</p><p>There are a few brothers here who are willing to be in one accord with me and to die to mammon. They are willing to give up all the money that passes into their hands for the house of God. Apart from their individual need for food, they give their entire salaries to the church. The church has all kinds of needs. Some of my colleagues have seen this and think that I am drawing two salaries! (One from the church!) We can all live in the dormitories provided by the company, but for the sake of having a place to meet, we would rather rent a house and cook for ourselves after work. (One brother is physically weak and is temporarily convalescing in this house of God. He cooks meals so that a meal is ready when we come home.) Brother Yen also lived in this house of God while he was in Zhan-Jiang, and he ate with us. He was very touched to see the brothers giving their all to maintain this house of God.</p><p>Presently, the coordination is still not perfect. Several of the brothers are still single, and some of the wives who believe in the Lord still have unbelieving husbands. If an entire family of believers in the Lord could migrate here, the church of God could increase more quickly.</p><p>In the beginning we met in the home of a married sister, and her eighth-grade daughter's heart was for the Lord. She often brought many of her female classmates to the meetings. As a result, several of these classmates believed in the Lord. Because we are too young, we are wary of being stumbled on account of the opposite sex, and we stopped our work among the girls after a while. I hope that a married sister can migrate to Siying in the future to continue this work.</p><p>I have gradually come to feel that the hardest kind of people to work with are those who have been in Christianity for many years. This work invites many false accusations. It is better and easier to speak to friends who have never heard the gospel.</p><p>I have not yet purchased the concordance written by Cruden, but I am still reading the Bible according to Brother Witness's "rote memorization" method. I hope to memorize every chapter in the New Testament and read the Old Testament through one or two times first. It is very difficult to memorize the Bible. I often read a chapter more than ten times without being able to find its central thought. It is also difficult to find the connection between chapters. The order of events recorded in the four Gospels is mixed up. I really do not know what is the best way to study. I will be finished with my internship at the end of this month. I hope to be able to spend more time studying the Bible and only a small amount of time reviewing homework connected with the Railway Department.</p><p>I have noted the things in a letter sent to me by Sister Peace Wang. She said that we should strike a balance between work and study. In the past I worked too much and did not study enough. A young brother should spend more time on studying. Therefore, we would rather curtail our work and spend more time on studying the Bible. I do not know if I am right in doing this.</p><p>The customs officers here (Leichow Customs Office) are transferred often. Would the brothers who are customs officers in the Shanghai Office be willing to apply for a transfer to the south? The brothers and sisters in the churches in Hong Kong and Canton are too busy taking care of their own affairs. I do not expect any of them to migrate to Siying and can only wait for the brothers and sisters from Shanghai.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Pao-sheng<br />April 9, 1948</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
