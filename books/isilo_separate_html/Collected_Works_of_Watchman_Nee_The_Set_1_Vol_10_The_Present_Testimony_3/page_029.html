Of the many things happening in this last age, how can we know which are done by God and which are not? How can we differentiate between spiritual things and soulish things? For example, many signs, miracles, and supernatural things take place. Are they done by God, or are they initiated by another power? Today I will talk about the power of the soul, what it is doing, and how it operates. Through this we may know what is from God and what is not.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROPHECIES IN THE BIBLE</H2><P>Before we go on, let us see in the Bible what will be the situation of the last age and what will be the signs of the Lord's second coming.</P><P>Matthew 24:24 says, "For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen."</P><P>Revelation 13:2-5 and 12-13 say, "And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. And one of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed. And the whole earth marveled after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? And who can make war with him? And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months....And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed. And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men."</P><P>Second Thessalonians 2:8-10 says, "And then the lawless one will be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of His coming), the coming of whom is according to Satan's operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie and in all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved."</P><P>Before explaining these verses, please notice that the word lie in 2 Thessalonians 2:9 can be translated as "deceit." A lie is a fabrication of something nonexistent, but deceit means something is there to deceive people. It does not refer to a nonentity, but to something that is actually there. However, this something is not from God; its purpose is to deceive people. Please do not misunderstand. This verse does not say that something does not exist. Saying that something is a lie may mean that it does not exist and is merely fabricated. But this verse refers to something that does exist, something that can be proven to exist. The purpose of its existence is to deceive people.</P><P>These three passages refer to what will happen during the great tribulation. Some of the things will happen before the great tribulation. Although these prophecies speak directly of the period of the great tribulation, a biblical principle tells us that before the fulfillment of a prophecy, many similar things will happen before the actual events. Many students of prophecy agree that the things that are happening in this age are a manifestation of the things that will come to pass in the great tribulation. However, the present events are not as severe as they will be during the great tribulation. The verses we have read today show us the main features of the great tribulation. At that time there will be signs and miracles. Before the Lord comes, Antichrist will especially want to perform signs and miracles. Just as the shadow always comes before a person's body, and his voice is heard before he appears, the "shadows" and "voices" of the signs and miracles of the great tribulation are already here. Since signs and miracles will be quite common during the great tribulation, the same must be true today, and we will surely see more signs and miracles around us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A NOTE OF CLARIFICATION</H2><P>Before I come to the subject, I need to make a clarification. Personally, I do not object to miracles. There are many miracles in the Bible, and they are most precious and important. Those who have been meeting here with us know that I have mentioned before that the proper growth of a believer requires several aspects. I have mentioned four aspects. Let me go over these four aspects again. First, after a person is saved, he should pursue the proper knowledge of the Bible. Second, he has to pursue the growth in spiritual life and pursue such things as victory, holiness, perfect love, etc. These are all very important matters. Third, he should be zealous in the work of saving people. Fourth, he should believe in God and have a specific faith. He should believe in God and trust in Him to the extent that he can experience God's work-miracles. Today in the church, that is, among the believers, there are many shortcomings. Many Christians only pay attention to the interpretation of the Bible. They may have very good knowledge, but they do not care about other things and do not have a heart to pursue after them. Some people are more advanced. They seek for a higher life and deeper things. Yet they do not care for the other three things. Some are zealous, but they do not have the proper knowledge. This kind of unbalanced seeking is not good. Strangely enough, in the church today, there are many who pursue after the interpretation of the Bible, both spiritually and literally. There are also quite a few who pursue deeper and more abundant life. More than a few are also zealous to save people. Unfortunately, it is hard to find some who have a living faith to trust in God and who desire to gain something from God. I have spent a great deal of effort previously to share with you the way to become a perfect Christian. First, you must have the knowledge of the Bible. Second, you must pursue after a more abundant, spiritual, profound, holy, and perfect life or living. Third, you must work zealously. Fourth, you must learn how to pray to God with faith, receive answers from God, and witness miracles from God. Every believer must have all four things and must grow in these four aspects equally, in a balanced way. There must not be any imbalance. So, please note that I am not against miracles. On the contrary, I pay much attention to miracles. However, due to the presence of false miracles and deceitful miracles, I would like to explain the difference between real ones and false ones. Today I want to tell you what a false miracle is. I am not against miracles themselves.</P><P>Please remember that all of God's works are done through both the Holy Spirit and our spirit; they are never done through our souls. The only way Satan works is through the power of the soul, through the power in man's flesh that became hidden through the fall. This is the reason Satan has to raise up an Antichrist in this last age and give his power and authority to this Antichrist; Satan has to use the latent power of the human soul. I have spent enough time in the last two messages on this matter. Now I would like to give some miscellaneous examples to show you what are not manifestations of spiritual power and show you that they are merely the manifestations of the latent power of the soul.</P><P>We have talked enough about the miraculous manifestation of the soul's power. Today let us consider some examples which are not miraculous.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
