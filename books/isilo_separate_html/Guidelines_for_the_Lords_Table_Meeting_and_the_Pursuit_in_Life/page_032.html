<p>From that time Christ in His resurrection has become our life. He brought His death and resurrection into us, completing the work of the cross that we need to bear. God in His eternal plan determined to perform a great &ldquo;surgery&rdquo; to terminate all things through the death of the cross. This death was produced through Christ becoming flesh, becoming a grain that would fall into the earth and die (John 12:24); this is the first step. After He became this grain, for a period of thirty-three and a half years He bore this death and lived in it. The Bible repeatedly shows that His death has terminated everything outside of God. This is the cross the Lord Jesus bore.</p>
<p>For thirty-three and a half years, this death was the cross that He bore. Although the Lord Jesus experienced this death, it was not yet an accomplished fact in the universe. For example, a man and a woman may love and trust each other, but as long as they are not married, they are not a couple. Once they are married, however, their marital relationship becomes a fact in the universe. In the same way, although the Lord Jesus lived in death, this death was not displayed or accomplished as a fact, a procedure, in the universe. Hence, after thirty-three and a half years, He went to Golgotha to fully accomplish this death; then He transmitted it to us in His resurrection. Only in His resurrection can we enjoy His death. In His resurrection we partake of Christ and all that He has accomplished.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #481 says, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not hard to die with Christ / When His risen life we know&rdquo; (stanza 2). What a statement this is! Christ in resurrection has become our enjoyment. When Christ was raised from the dead, He gave His life to James, Peter, and John. When we receive the resurrection life of the Lord, this resurrection life becomes our life. The Lord Jesus first bore the cross, and then He was crucified. Once the death of the cross was accomplished, He gave His life to us through resurrection. We were crucified with the Lord Jesus. We were crucified at the same time that the Lord Jesus was crucified.</p>
<p>Because the Lord has given us His life of death and resurrection, this life causes us to be united with His death. In His crucifixion He included us in His death. After He was crucified, we did not leave the cross. From that day forward, we receive the cross in the resurrection life; from that day forward, the cross has been on us and in us, and we are continually under the cross. This is to bear the cross. Bearing the cross is based on our crucifixion with Christ. He first bore the cross and then was crucified; we first are crucified and then bear the cross. Our crucifixion and His crucifixion transpired simultaneously. This shows that the Lord bore the cross before He was crucified; He was crucified after He bore the cross. Today we still have the cross upon us. Whenever the cross is not upon us, the death of Christ is not upon us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS GIVING US A DEEPER SEEING</h2>
<p><em>Question: Is there a higher experience related to the cross?</em></p>
<p>Answer: One day I was going to invite a brother to have fellowship about the problems he had in serving the Lord. Right after I decided to invite him, death began to operate in me. The operation of death asked me inwardly, &ldquo;Concerning your invitation, who is inviting him, you or God?&rdquo; As the cross was operating in me, I immediately asked myself, &ldquo;Am I inviting him, or is God inviting him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to see that the cross does not merely touch our behavior; it works so deeply that it touches us even in the matter of serving God. This aspect of the killing of the cross is not as simple as the killing that we experience when we are about to lose our temper with our family or when we are watching a movie; that kind of killing is too low. When we want to work for God, the cross operates in us at a higher level, asking, &ldquo;Is this of you? Or is it of God?&rdquo; If the cross checks us inwardly, we must submit to it immediately and say, &ldquo;O Lord, I will not invite the brother.&rdquo; In such cases, we need to be able to bow our head and say, &ldquo;Lord, I do not want any element of myself to be here.&rdquo; Therefore whenever we are about to speak to a brother, there will be an inward operation, asking, &ldquo;Does this word come from you or from God? Is it just for your own interest?&rdquo; This is the operation of the cross.</p>
<p>One day the Holy Spirit will reveal to us the universal death of the cross. Once it enters into us, it will begin a deep operation that not only touches us regarding our outward behavior but also gives us a deeper seeing. This is a higher experience of the cross. Our deliverance from the self and denying the self must be the issue of the work of the cross, because in ourselves we have no way to be delivered from the self and to deny the self. To be delivered from the self and to deny the self altogether depend on our receiving the work of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEATH OF THE CROSS AND<br />
THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p><em>Question: What is the difference between the killing of the cross and our submission to the discipline of the Holy Spirit?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Anyone who is not on the cross cannot submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Only those who live in the death of the cross can submit to the authority of the Holy Spirit, the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and the environmental dealings of the Holy Spirit. For thirty-three and a half years the Lord Jesus lived in death and under death. Death left a mark on Him; He carried the brands of death with Him and never departed from death.</p>
<p>Because death was always with the Lord Jesus, He could submit to the ruling of God continuously. We are identified with Christ&rsquo;s death in the resurrection life. This death in the resurrection life enters into us, operates in us, and enables us to submit to the authority, the restriction, and the dealings of the Holy Spirit. In this way, when we receive dealings in the environment, not only are we without murmuring, but we also rejoice. Anyone who does not live under the death of the cross cannot live under the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>There was a sister who was always submissive; she would do whatever she was told. However, although she was submissive and would do whatever people asked her to do, she would murmur afterward. When someone said, &ldquo;Sister, please wipe the chairs,&rdquo; she would wipe the chairs with smiles. Afterward, however, she would murmur and say, &ldquo;Why did you not ask someone else? Why did you choose me?&rdquo; I had never seen her refuse a request, but neither had I seen her do anything without murmuring. Although she was willing to accept all kinds of arrangements, it was always accompanied with murmuring. Outwardly she would accept and receive the arrangement with smiles, but inwardly she would murmur. Then when she saw someone close to her, she would say, &ldquo;The brothers&rsquo; arrangement is too much to bear.&rdquo; Her initial response was apparently submissive to the authority of the Holy Spirit, but actually it was not. Only those who live under the death of the cross can submit to God and say from the bottom of their heart that every arrangement of God in the environment is sweet and pleasant. Only such ones are really bearing the cross.</p>
<p>Bearing the cross began with Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. Our bearing of the cross is based on His crucifixion. He bore the cross to Golgotha, and His death on the cross was sown and imprinted in us. Hence, our way does not depend on asking or begging but on seeing that we have already died on the cross and have no way to escape His death. Taking the way of the cross in death involves neither being humble nor suffering. Whenever we touch this death, we touch Christ, we touch life, and we touch the Holy Spirit. At the same time we also touch the defeat of Satan and the losing of sin&rsquo;s power. In the death of the cross we see that all that the cross has accomplished, delivered, solved, judged, and dealt with is our portion.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
