   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECOGNIZING THAT MAN CANNOT MAKE IT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus told the young man to sell everything and distribute the money to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the young man could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord did not ask the aged Zaccheus to give away any of his money, yet he gave away a great sum all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why was there such a difference?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The difference lies in the phrase "the things that are impossible with men are possible with God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The young man was the best illustration of the first part of that verse "impossible with men," and Zaccheus was the best illustration of the second part of the verse "possible with God."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the first secret to victory lies in the first part of 18:27 "impossible with men."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You have to realize and learn that it is impossible with men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord's intention was not for the young man to sell all he possessed to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His intention was to show him the meaning of "impossible with men."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The young man was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He kept all Ten Commandments, and he thought that he was quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because of this the Lord purposely showed him that he still lacked one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many people have overcome many of the sins that they indulged in before their conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet there are still one or two sins which linger on that they cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord allows one or two things to remain in order to teach them that they cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is like a hurdle race where all the contestants fail to get over one or two hurdles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The champion may fail to get over one, and the runner-up, the third, and the last may fail to get over more than one hurdle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God knows that you cannot make it, but you do not know that you cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you keep all Ten Commandments, the Lord will show you that there is an eleventh commandment which you cannot keep.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With every one of us there are always one or two sins that we cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These sins are our private sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I was in Shanghai, I once went out to buy something and met a brother on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I nodded at him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After I crossed over to another street, I met him again, and I nodded at him again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I came to the front of the shop, he was there again, and I nodded at him once more.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I came out of the shop, he was still there, and we nodded again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within the space of an hour, I nodded at the brother over ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is our experience with some sins we encounter them again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we encounter a certain sin, tomorrow we encounter the same sin, and the third day we encounter the same sin yet again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These sins are familiar to us; we frequently commit them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our list of sins is never extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our sins are very specific.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who are stubborn are always entangled by stubbornness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who worry are always entangled by worries.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who are proud are always entangled by pride.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who are anxious are always entangled by anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who are prejudiced are always entangled by prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who are rash are always entangled by rashness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every person has "one thing."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At a minimum he has "one thing."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants to show us through such things that man cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Last year in Chefoo a doctor's wife was seeking after the overcoming experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Most of the people there had passed the gate of victory, and she was the only one who had not passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For a whole month she prayed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many of her sins were dealt with in the first three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But there was one sin that she could not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One afternoon everyone went to the restaurant for lunch, and the wife was playing the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After a while she stopped and began to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I asked her, "What is the matter?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She said, "I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is one thing which I can do nothing about.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>During the past few weeks, I have been dealing with my sins every day.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have overcome many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But I cannot overcome my habit of eating snack food.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am a Presbyterian missionary, but I dare not tell anyone else of my sin."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While she was speaking, she was weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As I sat and watched her weep, I was rejoicing and smiling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She asked, "Why are you smiling?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After some time I said to her, "I am so happy today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now do you realize that you cannot make it?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Over twenty days have passed, but thank God that you have finally come to the point where you realize that you cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You have to realize that the Lord allows this vestige of sin, this insurmountable barrier to remain in order to test the genuineness of your victory.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord just wants to show you that you cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once you see that you cannot make it, God will have a way."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The whole principle of God's work is to show you that you cannot make it, and that God alone can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There was a sister who was a mother and a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Her only trouble was that she worried about her children day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For a while she did not realize that her worrying was a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One day she saw it and could not let this matter go.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Prior to that time she did not know herself well enough.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But on that day she began to have a deeper knowledge of herself, and she felt that she could not go on in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people only know the doctrine of victory; they do not have the real experience of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>One of the reasons for this is that they do not know themselves well enough.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We know that Christ is our victory, but in order to experience Christ as our victory, we have to fulfill one condition we must first see that we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we constantly say in our hearts that we can make it, Christ will not be able to live for us; He will not be able to overcome for us, and He will not make it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Victory is for those who have utterly failed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But here is a problem: It is one thing to say that we cannot make it, and it is another thing to say that we no longer try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When were the lepers in Leviticus 13 and 14 cleansed?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They were declared clean by the priests when their leprosy had spread from the head to the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord raises only the dead; He does not raise those who are half alive and half dead.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to see that apart from the Lord we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The conditions for victory are: 1 seeing that we cannot make it and 2 not trying to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Being unable to make it and giving up on trying to make it are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some people know very well that they cannot make it, yet they still try to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For example, something may weigh a hundred catties a Chinese measure of weight , and you can only lift fifty catties.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You know that you cannot lift the hundred catties, but you try to do it anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God knows that we are totally corrupted and that there is no other way to deal with us except crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But the problem with man is that he still tries to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As a result, he resorts to all kinds of methods and struggles in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A person who struggles in this way will never be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Not trying to make it means that we not only acknowledge that we cannot make it, but also that we will not exercise any effort in trying to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We know that the Lord Jesus is living in us, and that He is accomplishing that which is impossible for us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>His power is not for making up the lack in our work, and His life is not for making up the lack in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He is living within us by replacing us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Whenever we exercise our own strength, we will not experience Him living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Therefore, we must not only see that we cannot make it, but we must give up trying to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Second Corinthians 13:5 says, "Do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?"</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Those who come to the Lord are not disapproved and have the Lord living within them.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The Lord is within you, yet your old man is also within you.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The two exist within you at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Both Christ and your old man reside within you.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This poses a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>What should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>One of the occupants has to move out.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>God's way of salvation is to move the old man out.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He has crucified the old man and put Christ within you instead.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Last year I met a Western sister in Chefoo who had three children.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The children always caused her to lose her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>She came to me and said, "I cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>What should I do?"</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I said, "If you cannot be patient, do not try to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>You have to say to the Lord, I cannot be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>From now on, I will not try to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Lord, You be my patience for me.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>I will not try to be patient anymore.'"</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If you learn to let go this way and not try to make it by yourself, but instead trust in the Lord's power, you will experience victory all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This way of victory is glorious.</S>
