[1]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR CHRIST AS GOD AND MAN SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS Scripture Reading: Heb 1 2
[2]  In these messages we will continue to see a general sketch of the New Testament in the light of Christ and the church.
[3]  Christ is better than Judaism because Judaism gives us God in name but not in reality, while Christ is the very embodiment and reality of God.
[4]  Chapter one quotes the prophecies in the Old Testament to tell us that the Son, through whom God speaks, is God Himself v. 8 . The angels, however, are merely the servants of God and even of those who inherit God's salvation vv.
[5]  As the book of Hebrews speaks about the difference between Christ and Judaism, it tells us who Christ is and what Christ has done; that is, it reveals the person and work of Christ.
[6]  If we intend to know Christ, we must know His person and His work.
[7]  To God, Christ is the effulgence of God's glory and the impress of His substance v. 3a , while to creation, Christ is the One who bears all things by the word of His power v. 3b . By this we can see that God and all His creatures are related to Christ.
[8]  THE WORK OF CHRIST IN HEBREWS 1 AND 2
[9]  The Apostle is the One sent to us from God, representing God to take care of us, as Moses did in the ancient times, while the High Priest is the One who goes to God from us as our Representative to take care of our case in the presence of God, in the heavenly court of law.
[10]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX CHRIST AS THE GREAT HIGH PRIEST SUPERIOR TO AARON Scripture Reading: Heb 4:14-16; 7:16, 25
[11]  The third section of the book of Hebrews, from 4:14 to 7:28, is a comparison between Christ and the high priest in Judaism.
[12]  It tells us that Christ Himself is the very God, the Son of God; He is the effulgence of God's glory and the impress of His substance.
[13]  As the Apostle, Christ is the One sent by God to us to be with us, to care for us, to meet our need, and to settle all our problems that we may enjoy Him as our rest and our everything to be built up as the dwelling place of God.
[14]  COMING FORWARD TO THE THRONE OF GRACE IN OUR SPIRIT
[15]  Hebrews 4:16 says, "Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help."
[16]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN CHRIST'S NEW COVENANT SUPERIOR TO THE OLD Scripture Reading: Heb 8:1-3, 6, 10-12; 9:14-17; 10:19-25
[17]  Ministering the Eternal, Heavenly, Spiritual, Living, and Refreshing Things
[18]  On the negative side, Christ is typified by Aaron, while on the positive side, He is typified by Melchisedec.
[19]  They often speak of how Christ loved us, shed His blood and died for us, and redeemed us and reconciled us to God so that we may be justified by faith and forgiven of our sins.
[20]  The fourth main section of Hebrews, from 8:1 to 10:39, tells us that the new covenant enacted by Christ is much better than the old.
[21]  Christ offered Himself as the real sacrifice for sin and shed His blood to wash away our sins, and by the shedding of His blood He enacted this covenant for us.
[22]  THE MAKER, MEDIATOR, EXECUTOR, AND MINISTER OF THE NEW COVENANT
[23]  The items of the covenant are things Christ has already accomplished, and there are no conditions or terms for their completion.
[24]  By shedding His blood, Christ enacted this deed, the covenant, and through His death He left this title deed to us as a will, a testament.
[25]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT ENTERING THE VEIL AND GOING OUTSIDE THE CAMP Scripture Reading: Heb 12:1-3; 13:10-13; Exo 33:7
[26]  The first tells us that Christ is superior to the angels, the second that Christ is superior to Moses, the third that Christ is superior to Aaron, and the fourth that Christ's new covenant is superior to the old.
[27]  Verses 12 and 13 speak concerning our portion of Christ as our offering on the earth.
[28]  On the one hand, Christ opened the heavens for us to enjoy Him in the heavens, and on the other hand, He is our portion to enjoy that we may follow Him to suffer on this earth by walking the way of faith.
[29]  Today, we Christians have to learn how to enter the veil by a new and living way which was opened for us by the blood of Christ to enjoy the heavenly Christ within the veil, in our spirit, and in the heavens.
[30]  The Camp Being the Organized Religion of the Day
[31]  We who enjoy the heavenly Christ in the Holy of Holies within the veil need to follow Him in our walk on this earth.
[32]  The camp is organized religion, which claims to be the people of God yet gives no room to Christ.
[33]  CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE FAITH AND ITS ISSUES IN JAMES Scripture Reading: James 1:17-18, 12, 21; 2:5; 4:5-8; 5:14, 7-8; Acts 21:18-21
[34]  We may now consider some verses from the short book of James, not according to their order in the chapters but according to a spiritual order.
[35]  The Implanted Word and the Saving of the Soul
[36]  CHAPTER THIRTY THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD IN 1 AND 2 PETER Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:17; 4:17; 2:12; 2 Pet 2:9; 3:7; 1 Pet 1:2-4, 18-19, 22-23; 2:2-5, 9; 5:1-5; 2 Pet 1:1-7
[37]  Although the subject of the Epistles of Peter is the government of God, their content is still in the principle of the inner life and the church life.
[38]  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you."
[39]  First Peter 2:4-5 says, "Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
[40]  In the last chapter of 1 Peter there are the elders and the flock of God, which is the church.
[41]  Verses 1 to 5 of chapter five say, "Therefore the elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory to be revealed: Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God; not by seeking gain through base means but eagerly; nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock.
[42]  Second Peter 1:1-4 says, "Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted faith equally precious as ours in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; seeing that His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who has called us by His own glory and virtue, through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust."
[43]  CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP IN THE EPISTLES OF JOHN AND CONTENDING FOR THE FAITH IN JUDE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-3, 5-7; 2:27; 3:24; 4:13; 2 John 7-11; 3 John 5-10
[44]  First John 1:1-3 says, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us ; that which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ."
[45]  Then on the positive side, the Holy Spirit is always moving, working, and anointing within us based upon the sprinkling of the blood.
[46]  First John tells us that we have to love the brothers, but 2 John tells us that we have to be very strict with certain ones who claim to be Christians.
[47]  This Epistle also shows us that among the believers, there are often some who want to be the head.
