   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We cannot speak of the organization of the church apart from God s authority and God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without God s authority and grace, there is a lack in the organization of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All that is left is a social group, a societal organization, not the genuine church with a proper organization.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The organization of the church is under God s authority and in God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not submit to God s authority and are not enjoying God s grace, we should not speak of the organization of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In its essence the organization of the church is based on God s authority and God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Offices come from His authority, and gifts come from His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone who fulfills his office submits to God s authority; everyone who exercises his gift lives in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the organization of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we carry out our offices in the church, we must ask ourselves whether or not we are submitting to God s authority and whether or not we are living in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not submit to God or live in fellowship with God, whatever we do will be worthless, even if it is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It will be nothing but human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not sufficient to measure ourselves only according to biblical principles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are not under God s authority and experiencing God s grace, even though we may be doing things according to biblical principles, all that we have is human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to be rescued from such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the past many saints held firmly to biblical principles without realizing the significance of authority and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To speak about the organization of the church according to the letter in the Bible will produce merely another human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No matter how scriptural our practice may be, if it is only according to letter, it will still be human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In contrast, if we submit to God s authority and experience His grace, the condition among us will be according to the intrinsic principles of the Bible, even if our knowledge of the Bible is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our being according to biblical principle is not a matter of letter or doctrine but a matter of spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we submit to God s authority in regard to the offices and experience God s grace in regard to the gifts, all the problems will be gone, and there will be no need for argument.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In contrast, if we do not submit to God s authority or experience God s grace but are merely according to the principle of the letter in the Bible, sooner or later we will have disputes, and problems will arise among us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the past century this has been the problem among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May the Lord have mercy on us that we would never decide the matters of the organization of the church based merely on the letter in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must see that the source of the organization of the church is God s authority and God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Corinthians 12:4-5 says, There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Spirit denotes grace, and Lord denotes authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The basic matters in the organization of the church are authority and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To have an office we must submit to authority, and to have a gift we must experience grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever we touch the organization of the church, we touch the authority of the Head and the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May the Lord rescue us from being right in principle but dead in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way, may we be His living Body, coordinating together, standing in our proper place, and supplying others according to our measure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the condition described in Psalm 133: Behold, how good and how pleasant it is / For brothers to dwell in unity!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>/ It is like the fine oil upon the head / That ran down upon the beard, / Upon Aaron s beard, / That ran down upon the hem of his garments; / Like the dew of Hermon / That came down upon the mountains of Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>/ For there Jehovah commanded the blessing: / Life forever.</S>
