   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING DELIVERED FROM INDEPENDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have Body consciousness we will comprehend immediately that the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, in spiritual work, it cannot be individualistic in its scope.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to participate rightly in the Lord's work, it is imperative that we deal with this matter of independent labor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the thinking of some people, a person must lay his own hand on things or else that person will consider those things to be good for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whatever is done by him is deemed as having spiritual value; what is not done by him has no value at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he preaches and nobody is saved, he feels depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When he preaches and people are saved, he shows pleasant surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because he looks at the work as his own personal labor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the moment God's children perceive the oneness of the Body, they immediately comprehend the oneness of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The instant they see that the Body is one, they are delivered from their individual endeavor since they now see the work of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not imply that a person can no longer labor as an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It simply means that he can no longer consider work as belonging solely to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether the work is done by him or not is no problem anymore, so long as it is done by someone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As Christians, we should admire and seek for spiritual things, but we ought not have any emulative pretensions nor any trace of jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our attitude individually towards spiritual work should be: What I can do I hope others can also do; and what I cannot do I wish someone else can do; I would like to do more as well as I would expect other people to do more.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How I need to realize that I can only be a single vessel in the work; I cannot monopolize it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I dare not consider the work and its result as altogether mine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I insist that everything must be done by me, I have not apprehended the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The moment I apprehend the Body, immediately I realize that both my labor and that of others mean gain to the Head as well as to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And let all glory be to the Lord and all blessings be to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord distributes His work to all, and everyone has his share.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must not think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should be faithful to the portion which the Lord has given each of us; but we should also respect the portion He gives to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many young people possess a kind of competitive attitude in which they are always comparing what they have with that which others do not have and what they do not have with that which others have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, such comparison is absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can we add a chair to a table?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are they one or two?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A table plus a chair equals a table and a chair.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are asked which is better, the hand or the eye, we can only answer that the hand and the eye are both good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He who has seen the Body recognizes the functions of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He looks at himself as only one among many members.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will not project himself to a distinctive position in order to compare himself favorably with others or even to occupy another's place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>V. STAYING IN FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He who sees the Body of Christ most spontaneously sees not only the stupidity of independent action but the need for fellowship as well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fellowship is not an external exercise in social intercourse; it is the spontaneous demand of body life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is erroneously but commonly assumed to be fellowship by God's children is a visiting of homes of some brothers and sisters at times of leisure and chit-chatting with them a while.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In actuality, fellowship means realizing the total inadequacy of my own self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am desirous of doing all things with the other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although for doing many things I am not able to gather all the brothers and sisters in the church, I still can do them with two or three brothers and/or sisters according to the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Oftentimes we need to learn fellowship in prayer, to learn fellowship in difficulties, to learn fellowship in seeking God's will, to learn fellowship concerning our future, and to learn fellowship regarding God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What fellowship means is that, knowing that I am inadequate in the matter of prayer, I seek out two or three others to pray with me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I by myself am incompetent in solving difficulties, hence I ask two or three brethren to deal with the situations together with me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Alone I am unable to know God's will, therefore I solicit the help of two or three others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I in myself am rather confused as to my future, consequently I request two or three brothers and sisters to fellowship and decide with me what my future should be.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I cannot understand God's word alone, so now I study the word of God with two or three brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In fellowship, I acknowledge my insufficiency and incompetency, and I also acknowledge my need of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I confess that I am limited and liable to make mistakes; for this I plead with those brothers and sisters who have spiritual discernment to help me and not just ask those to help me who are affectionate towards me .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am inadequate, and hence I need the help of other brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Body of Christ is a life, and there is therefore also a consciousness involved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You yourself will become conscious or aware of the fact that without fellowship you cannot live.</S>
