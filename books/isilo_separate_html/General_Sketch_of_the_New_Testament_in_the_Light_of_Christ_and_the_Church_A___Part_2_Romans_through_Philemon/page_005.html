Then, on the third day God resurrected Him; this resurrection was also a part of the process of God&#8217;s setting forth of Christ. After the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, God received Christ into the heavens and placed Him at His right hand. This receiving and placing are also a part of the setting forth. God set forth Christ through the entire process of His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to sit at the right hand of God. This setting forth makes Christ Himself the very propitiation. Now by Christ as the propitiation, the righteousness of God can be applied to us.<p>This section of Romans says that on the one hand, we are justified through the redemption in Christ Jesus, that is, through faith in His blood (3:24-25), and on the other hand, we are justified because of the resurrection of Christ (4:25). The shedding of blood and the resurrection of Christ are the main steps in the process of the setting forth of Christ by God. By this means God set forth Christ as a propitiation place. God placed Christ, set forth Christ, from the time that He shed His blood to the time that He ascended to sit at the right hand of God. It is by this propitiation that what God recognizes can be applied to us and become ours. We must never forget that propitiation includes Christ Himself, His crucifixion, His resurrection, and His ascension.<h2 class=head2>Experiencing Propitiation by Faith</h2><p>The fourth crucial word in this section of Romans is faith (3:25-31). We have seen the glory of God, the righteousness of God, and Christ as the propitiation place. The way to experience propitiation is by faith. These terms are difficult to grasp because they are not found in our human concept.<h2 class=head2>Reaching God&#8217;s Standard by Justification</h2><p>The fifth important word is justification (4:25; 3:24, 26). The main thought of justification is that we come up to God&#8217;s standard. By faith we experience propitiation, and by propitiation God&#8217;s own righteousness becomes ours. Hence, we can reach the standard of God&#8217;s glory. Now we are justified and do not fall short.<h2 class=head2>Being Reconciled to God</h2><p>After justification we have reconciliation (5:10-11). To be reconciled means to have peace and harmony. Now because of justification, we are in harmony with God. Between us and God there is peace and real harmony.<h2 class=head2>Boasting in God</h2><p>As we have seen, six main points are found in the second section of Romans: God&#8217;s glory, God&#8217;s righteousness, Christ Himself set forth as the propitiation, faith, justification, and reconciliation. The last verse of this section says, &#8220;And not only so, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation&#8221; (5:11). Eventually, this entire section brings us into God. In this reconciliation we are enjoying God, boasting in God, and glorying in God. Now God is our portion. We are not only reconciled to God, but by justification we are in God, and God is our boast, our enjoyment, and our everything. This is the conclusion of this section of Romans.<p>In summary, God&#8217;s glory is His standard. If we are not up to that standard, we cannot pass the test. It is impossible to measure up to His standard in ourselves, but His righteousness is the potential for us to come up to the standard of His glory. Now His righteousness is ours because God set forth Christ as the propitiation place. The way that we share propitiation is by faith. When we believe in Christ, we share propitiation, and under this propitiation and in this propitiation God&#8217;s righteousness is ours. Now we have a righteousness that is not our own but God&#8217;s. Moreover, this righteousness brings us and uplifts us to the standard of God&#8217;s glory, so we are justified. Because of this justification we are in harmony with God; that is, we are reconciled to God. There is real peace and harmony between us and God. Now we are in God, and we boast, glory, and rejoice in Him. God is our boast, our portion, and our enjoyment. This is the meaning of justification. May we be impressed deeply with these matters.<p>Romans 5:10 says, &#8220;For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.&#8221; To be saved in His life is dealt with in the following section of Romans, which immediately follows verse 11.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
