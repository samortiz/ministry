   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SATURATED WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thy Spirit will me saturate,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every part will God permeate .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hymns, #501</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our relationship with God should reach to this extent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our whole being must be saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not be content with outwardly worshipping Him, loving Him, fearing Him, and doing things to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This mysterious God has passed through a process: creation, incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now He has returned as the Spirit to enter all who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such is our God and our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He does not want us to worship Him from afar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He does not want us to stand in awe of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nor does He want us to perform certain duties to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What He wants is that we open the deepest part of our being to Him and call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then His Spirit comes into us, making our deadened spirit life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From there He spreads out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we set our mind on the spirit, the soul too is saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It also becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the soul, life spreads also to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The resurrection life saturates it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When every part of us is saturated with this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, we are in the union that God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has no use for the religious forms of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He does not want us to bow, kneel, or prostrate ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What He wants are those who have a contrite heart and will open themselves to Him, receiving Him as their life, light, power, and even their living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The worship He wants is this union.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we give Him the opportunity to be in union with us, this is worship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To allow Him to be joined with us is what pleases Him most.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the true nature of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For most Christians, however, Christianity has become a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The talk about bearing the cross, for example, is similar to what Buddhism and Hinduism teach.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The talk about living uprightly sounds like the ethics of Confucius, entirely apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way God wants us to live exceeds human ethics or morality, because it is Christ Himself lived out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE SHORTCOMING OF NATURAL VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us take the example of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the wedding ceremony, the groom promises to love his wife, and the bride vows to submit to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not too many days after the wedding, however, trouble arises between this new couple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their personalities are not compatible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The groom may be an even-tempered person, but the slowness of his wife nonetheless provokes him beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The bride, on her part, cannot stand this speedy man she has married.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It seems she has no way to keep up with him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whatever they vowed at their wedding ceremony is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Loving and submitting those promises have to be thrown away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In time there is some easing of the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Perhaps a talk with someone helps.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps they hear a message which inspires them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They resolve to work out their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yes, the groom thinks, I am too fast; I should be more sympathetic toward my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The bride too resolves she will try harder to catch up with her husband; after all, he is her head.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These renewed efforts on the part of the groom to be loving and the wife to be submissive cause a great deal of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose they succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The husband does find enough love for his wife, and the wife manages to submit to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God does not want that.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He does not want a love nor a submission which is apart from Christ.</S>
