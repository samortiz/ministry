   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Judgment of This World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the Lord's death, 12:31 says, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse indicates that through the Lord's death the world, the anti-God system of Satan, has been judged and also indicates that the ruler of this world has been cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter twelve of John we do not have the thought of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, this chapter speaks concerning multiplication, the drawing of all men to the Lord, the judgment of the world, and the casting out of the ruler of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order for all men to be drawn to the Lord so that He might be multiplied, it was necessary for the world system, which usurps mankind, to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fallen mankind is under the tyranny, the usurpation, of the world, just as the children of Israel were under the tyranny and usurpation of Pharaoh in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After God judged Egypt and Pharaoh, Pharaoh let the children of Israel go.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, the world, which usurps the children of God, has been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross, the world was judged.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the reason Paul could say, "The world has been crucified to me and I to the world" Gal 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This makes it possible for God's chosen people to be released from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the ruler of this world has been cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the sight of God and in the sight of the angels, demons, and Satan, this world has been judged, condemned, and its ruler has been cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the world and its ruler, Satan, are powerless to hold us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Realizing That We Are Christ's Glorification</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through the Lord's death the divine life within Him was released.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then in resurrection He imparted this life to God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way God's people have become His multiplication, a multiplication which is His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one in history has been glorified in such a way as the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today there are Christians all over the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though many believers are weak, it cannot be denied that Christians are Christ's multiplication and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Unfortunately, many believers do not realize that they are Christ's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you ever realized that you are a part of Christ's glorification?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Probably you have not realized this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps your understanding of Christ's death has been according to traditional teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most of the biblical truths, including the truth concerning redemption, have been leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, very few Christians know the truth in a complete and pure way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the contrary, nearly every truth has been leavened, reduced, and covered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, I hope that we all shall see that the Lord's death was not only for redemption, but was also for His glorification through multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are His multiplication, and as His multiplication we are His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the Lord predicted His glorification, He went on to give a lengthy message concerning it, a message recorded in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter fourteen we have the Father's house; in chapter fifteen, the vine with all its branches; and in chapter sixteen, the newborn man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father's house, the vine, and the new man are all the result of Christ's multiplication; they are the issue of His reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we have pointed out in previous messages, the Father's house, the vine, and the new man are the Lord's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, in 17:1 He prayed, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that in chapter seventeen the Lord prayed for His multiplication, which would be the issue, the result, of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a grain of wheat, He fell into the ground and died, and then He rose up to become many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now these grains have become the Father's house, the vine, and the new man for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This, therefore, is the purpose of Christ's death unfolded in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE LORD'S BOLDNESS IN PRESENTING HIMSELF TO BE PUT TO DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After praying for His glorification, the Lord presented Himself in chapter eighteen to be arrested, tried, judged, and put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus boldly presented Himself for death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He knew where He would be arrested.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In chapter thirteen the Lord even encouraged Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He told the disciples that one of them would betray Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then He gave a morsel to the betrayer, to Judas, and said to him, "What you do, do more quickly" 13:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After Judas took the morsel and went out, the Lord again spoke concerning His glorification: "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus certainly knew that the time had come for Him to be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, He spoke not of being put to death, but of being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His word in 13:31-32 corresponds to His prayer in chapter seventeen, the prayer that the Father might glorify the Son so that the Son might glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To glorify the Son actually means to put the Son to death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, by praying for His glorification the Lord was praying concerning His death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John 18:1 says, "When Jesus said these things, He went forth with His disciples across the brook Kedron, where there was a garden, into which He entered and His disciples."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord delivered Himself of His own accord to the process of death, as He mentioned in 10:17-18.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He did this voluntarily and boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He went to the garden where He knew that He would be betrayed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For what purpose was He betrayed?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was betrayed in order that He might be put to death so that He might be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May we all have a clear vision concerning this.</S>
