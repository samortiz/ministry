   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE AVAILABILITY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 2:9; John 14:16-20; Rom 8:9; Eph 3:8; Phil 1:19; Rom 10:6-10, 12-13; 8:11, 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to see the availability of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is so available and ready for us to enjoy Him at any time and in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The chorus of hymn #539 in our hymnal says:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How dear and near to me!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How I admire Thy marvelous</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Availability!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The processed Triune God is embodied in Christ Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The processed Triune God is a new expression that we use to describe or unveil what we have seen and what we have experienced of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The divine Trinity is not for our theological study but for our experiential enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order for God to be our enjoyment, He needs to be triune.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The doctrine of the Trinity has been a matter of great debate among Christian teachers since the second century.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Strictly speaking, it is very hard for any Christian to have an adequate, unbiased, fully balanced, perfect, and complete apprehension, understanding, or realization of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have been studying the Bible for over sixty years, and much of this time has been occupied with the study of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through my study, I have discovered that the divine Trinity is the basic structure of the composition of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible may be considered as a building, and the divine Trinity is the structure within the building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most of this structure is not so manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you look at the hall that we built in Anaheim, you will be able to see only stones and wood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the main and basic structure of the inside of the building is steel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The columns of the building are actually steel pillars covered with stone and wood, and these pillars support long steel beams.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same way, the underlying structure of the Bible is the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From eternity according to His revelation, God had the intention, the desire, and even the good pleasure to be enjoyed by His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What He had in view was that He could have a thorough mingling with this people, making Himself one with them and making them altogether like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His good pleasure, which became His desire and intention, was to make His people His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to do this, He had to be triune.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is one unique God, yet three.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Throughout the centuries, theologians have used different expressions to describe the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times I could describe the Three of the Godhead only with the term the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To say that the Three of the Godhead are three persons is not wrong, but to extend this description too far can lead one astray in his understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Three of the divine Trinity are distinct, but They are not separate or divided.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may say that They are three distinct persons, but They are distinct to a certain point and then They are one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one can say to what extent the three Persons of the Godhead are distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may illustrate this fact by considering a tree with one trunk and three branches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one can tell where the three branches end and the trunk begins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even to use the adjective three-in-one to describe this tree is not fully accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually this entity is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because God is three, He uses plural pronouns such as we, us, and our to refer to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Genesis 1:26, God said, Let us make man in our image.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is really three, yet He is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one hand, God is three, but on the other hand, He is one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one can tell to what degree the one God is three and to what extent the Three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our God is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ephesians 1 shows us the purpose of God s being three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Father chose us v. 4 , predestinating us, marking us out v. 5 . Following the Father s choosing, the Son came in to redeem us v. 7 . Redemption implies regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Lord Jesus comes, we will be glorified, and that glorification is the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our being glorified is the ultimate consummation of Christ s all-inclusive redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Following the Son s redemption, the Spirit came in to seal us and to be our pledge vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Father s predestinating and the Son s redeeming were actions, or doings, but these actions do not imply that the Person of the Father or the Person of the Son have been given to us and dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Spirit, however, seals us and becomes a pledge within us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The sealing and pledging of the Spirit are not only actions but also a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In other words, the Person of the Spirit is the action of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The sealing of a piece of paper is not only an action, because the seal itself gets onto the paper, and is even dispensed into the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the action of sealing, the seal comes to the paper, stays on the paper, and becomes one with the paper to be a part of the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the sealing, the seal mingles itself with the paper because the seal penetrates into the very essence of the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, the essence of the paper and the essence of the seal are altogether mingled as one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit was also given to us as a pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As the pledge, or the foretaste, of what we shall inherit of God in full, the Spirit was pledged into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Father acted to choose us, predestinating us, the Son acted to redeem us, and the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God put Himself into our being as the sealing and the pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the full salvation of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Spirit is an all-inclusive Person, including the Father and the Son, and this one Person, the divine Three, becomes the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The seal is the divine Trinity as our full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This all-inclusive, ultimate, consummate Person comprises selection with predestination, redemption, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All these items along with the Father, the Son, the Spirit, divinity, and humanity are included in this one ultimate and consummate Person, who is the complete seal.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This seal, which is also the divine sealing ink, has come to reach us, that is, to put Himself on us and into us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The ultimate, consummate, divine Person Himself with His action comes to reach us, the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then He stays with us in a thoroughly mingled way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Spirit as the seal and the sealing ink penetrates the essence of our being to be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He penetrates into us to become our very intrinsic element and essence; He remains in us even to become us, our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The divine, full salvation is the processed Triune God with all His doings and His Being becoming our essence, our element, and even our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Over sixty years ago, I was a piece of unsealed paper.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But today I am a piece of sealed paper.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We believers have been sealed with the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Just as sealed paper cannot be separated from the seal, we cannot be separated from the processed, sealing Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our God today is the processed Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is not the raw God but the cooked God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>To say that God is the cooked God means that He is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The raw groceries that we buy need to go through the process of cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After being cooked, these raw groceries become a cooked meal.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our God really went through a cooking process.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He entered into the womb of a human virgin and remained there for nine months to fulfill the principle in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After being born, He lay in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He went to Nazareth and lived there for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As the Passover Lamb, He was roasted with fire Exo 12:8-11 on the cross and burned with the divine fire of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>These are some of the processes our God passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He passed through a long period of cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Our God is no longer raw.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He is the cooked God, the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>New York steak is very good, but no one would want to eat it raw.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We eat cooked beef.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In like manner, our God today is the processed Triune God ready for us to enjoy as our spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This processed Triune God can be seen in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord said that He came in the Father s name in 5:43.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This means that the Son came as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When the Son came to be a man, He came with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Son told us in 16:32 that He was not alone because the Father was with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is why He told Philip in 14:9, He who has seen Me has seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The Lord Jesus told us that He did everything out from the Father 5:19 , that He did the Father s work 4:34; 17:4 , that He spoke the Father s word 14:10, 24 , that He sought the Father s will 5:30 , and that He sought the Father s glory 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Furthermore, the Son told us that the Father would send the Spirit in His name in 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This means that the Spirit came as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Son also told us that He would send the Spirit from the Father in 15:26.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Greek word for from is para, and the sense here is from with.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Spirit is sent not only by the Father in the Son s name but also by the Son and with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>These verses in John reveal the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Our God today is enjoyable.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>As the processed Triune God, He is the cooked food on the dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Everything is ready for us to come and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In Luke 15, Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, likened Himself to a fattened calf who was ready to be killed for feeding the returned prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In His process the Triune God became a fattened calf, and He was killed on the cross so that we might feed on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This calf has been killed and roasted for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We experience the processed Triune God when we call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>When we say, O Lord Jesus, we have the deep sensation of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>When we call on the name of the Lord, the Spirit comes.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If we do not call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we will not have the deep sensation that the Spirit is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When we call a person s name, that person will come because the name denotes the person.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The name is the Lord Jesus and the person of that name is realized in the Spirit John 14:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We call on the second Person of the Trinity, but the third Person comes.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Furthermore, when we call on the Lord Jesus, the Spirit comes, and we have the sensation that the Father is here who loves us so much.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This is the processed Triune God embodied in the name of the Lord Jesus for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>All three of the divine Trinity are embodied in this name.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Some may not have much assurance that the processed Triune God is within them, and they may not know how to touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We need to realize that we can call on the name of the Lord Lord Jesus anywhere and anytime.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The entire processed Triune God is embodied in this name.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When we touch this name, something happens.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>When we call on this name, a wonderful One comes.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We have to be those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ at all times and in every place 1 Cor 1:2 so that we can be brought into the proper way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>While we are coming to the meeting, we need to be calling, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If we are driving, we can call on the Lord s name in the car until we get to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>After entering into the meeting place, we should continue to call.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>If we are this kind of meeting persons, what will our meeting be like?</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Our meeting will be filled with the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>In this kind of atmosphere or situation, everyone will speak something, and the meeting will be a feast full of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Such a meeting will feed people, and this feeding will issue in the building up of the Body of Christ, the enlargement of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>This kind of meeting cannot be seen in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>What they have is a religious service with a little speaking of God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit, but without the rich speaking, realization, experience, and enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Our meeting has to be a meeting full of the enjoyment, the experience, the realization, and the speaking of this very processed Triune God embodied in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>My burden in the new way is not just to see the saints knocking on doors for gospel preaching and setting up home meetings for Christian edification.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We have to drop the entire traditional way of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>We have to open up ourselves, our entire being, to this processed Triune God that we may experience Him, enjoy Him, realize Him in full, and learn to speak Him.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Until we reach such a level, such a standard, we have not reached the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We all have to endeavor to reach such a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>When we reach this point, we will have the best replacement for the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>I want to see not only the increase in the Lord s recovery but also the exhibition of the processed Triune God in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>We may have a big congregation without the exhibition of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>We need the increase of numbers but we also need the content of the meetings, which is the full exhibition of the processed Triune God whom we have experienced and enjoyed and whom we are now realizing and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>The meeting needs such content.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>We have to see what the new way is.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>It is not just door-knocking or home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>The new way is the processed Triune God experienced, enjoyed, realized, and spoken by us.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>We all need to receive such a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>We should be able to testify to the angels, the demons, the Christians, and the entire universe that we know what the new way is.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>This way to meet and to serve is the God-ordained, scriptural way for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>This scriptural way is what the Lord is seeking today and has been seeking for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>He is in the process of getting what He is after among us.</S>
