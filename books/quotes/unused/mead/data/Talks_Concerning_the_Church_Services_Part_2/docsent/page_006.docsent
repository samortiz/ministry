   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT PRACTICING OUR PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN A REGULAR AND DILIGENT WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we want to continue our practical fellowship concerning the church services.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we have realized in earlier chapters, the first step in God s ordained way to serve is to preach the gospel as New Testament priests by visiting people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An effective way for this to be carried out is for the local saints to be formed into teams of three for going out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>ACHIEVING SUCCESS BY BEING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>REGULAR AND CONSISTENT</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for the gospel teams to carry out a successful work, they must go out in a regular and consistent way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All school teachers know that students must attend school regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the school term is four and a half months long, the students must go to their classes daily and weekly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Occasionally within one school semester students may need to ask for a leave of absence or remain home due to sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That is common and excusable.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if the attendance of a class often ranges from a high of sixty to a low of thirty, it will be difficult for any proper lessons to be taught to that class.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If our gospel team attendance is not regular, we may have results, but those results will not be satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to my own experience, only one place where I labored had satisfactory results Chefoo, my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I also worked for a while in the nearby town of Tsingtao and had a great part in the work in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After spending time in Shanghai for quite a long time, I went to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From 1950 on, I labored in Manila in the Philippines every year for at least three or four months.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then I came to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In conclusion, I realized that the situation was the same everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Generally speaking, although the teachings we gave were not so adequate, the saints were very responsive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They accepted the teachings and did something to put them into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the results were not satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was due to the fact that our kind of service was not carried out in a regular way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every class that achieves satisfactory results must be regularly attended.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A class of forty-five today and thirty-five tomorrow could not be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of course, if everyone in a church of two hundred fifty to three hundred were serving, that would be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, we cannot expect everyone to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do expect, though, that fifty to sixty saints would rise up to go out and visit people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In February of 1986 I called an urgent elders training and gave messages on the matter of being in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I received a real burden from the Lord to sound the trumpet like Gideon to form an army.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believed and did expect a number to join me to fight against the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time I made it clear that if some do not join my army it does not mean that they are no longer a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said strongly that they are still a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I only requested that they not criticize or oppose the army, since this would cause trouble and then division.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, they should pray for this army.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This army will fight in order that the recovery may gain some fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must fight against this enemy of barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who followed Gideon to fight against the Philistines defeated them and rescued the entire nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE PROPER PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although I studied the Lord s new way in Taipei since 1984, I did not have the adequate time to help the trainees to be ushered into its proper practice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I had to take care of three other things the training, the church in Taipei, and the translation of the Recovery Version into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After five years of study, I can now conclude that the new way involves four main steps.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must first exercise our priesthood to bring sinners to be saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second, we must feed the new ones in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After nourishing the new ones to grow, we can then form them together into a group to have group meetings in order to educate and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Last, by perfecting them to prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord, they can directly build up the Body of Christ by speaking for the Lord in the larger meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After traveling and visiting many churches during the past two years, I realized that everyone has learned the doctrine of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Recently on the island of Taiwan many of the co-workers went out to visit the churches to speak the same thing as I did.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although there is much speaking concerning the new way, nearly no one practices it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our situation is similar to a coach who speaks all the time concerning how to get the ball and shoot, but none of the team members shoot or play ball.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We may even become eloquent speakers of the new way so that the saints know everything, but nearly no one is playing ball.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may argue that to some extent we have been playing, but we still play in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who cannot play basketball in a natural way?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everyone can.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, we may play the piano for our entire life, yet still know nothing, because we touch the keys in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If at the present time we have no new ones under our care, we must go to visit homes to bring sinners to believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is no need to gain too many.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To gain three or four is adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Concerning the skill required to bring people to be saved, we need to receive some instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, it may be advisable to go to warm doors first, rather than cold doors.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The warm doors are those of our relatives, cousins, and in-laws.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These doors will always be open to us; we will not be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We also have our friends, neighbors, classmates, schoolmates, and colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should make a list of all of these friends and relatives and classify them according to what kind of persons they are.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some will be easier to gain than others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Due to this, eventually we may not need to knock on some cold doors.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The friends and relatives that we bring to the Lord and baptize will bring us to their own relatives and classmates for us to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then more warm doors will be open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Eventually, this will become a kind of chain reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then, every door will provide us with ones to save and baptize.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is just a matter of our diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We do not need to do too much, but just give the Lord two and a half hours every week.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we give this time to the Lord, we must mean business.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No school teacher could keep a job if he or she were unaware of the number of students in the class or ignorant of which lessons to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Before giving this time to the Lord every week, we must stir ourselves up by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must catch the spirit of gospel preaching through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After three or four are baptized, we should immediately begin to feed these new ones in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Do not insist that they come to our home for home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>On the contrary, we must go to their home.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the real home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Here we can feed them for a few weeks or even three or four months, depending on each person.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should then do our best to bring them out of their home so that we may group them together with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>By collecting the new ones together from different homes, we can form a group meeting for their perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Eventually we can lead them to attend the larger church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>From now on we should not go out to knock on doors and reach people according to our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must not carry out these four steps in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>No tutor or piano teacher would allow any of the students to use their fingers as they like.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The most difficult thing is to instruct the new ones to use their fingers properly.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Some of those who play the piano excel as pianists because they were under a strict tutor for at least ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Nearly the entire day they sat there and played according to strict instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Otherwise, they could not play in a concert.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is the same way in reaching people at their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I have heard many places testify of door-knocking, home meetings, and group meetings, but I just shake my head.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>What is on my heart is this.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As long as we are not overage, we should go out regularly and carry out these four steps exactly as the training instructs.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If each of us promises to give two and a half hours a week, eventually we will get into it.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When we get into it, we will acquire a taste for it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Then we may even desire to go out twice a week.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Every time the teams come together for fellowship, some brothers will give some instructions and training prior to going out.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This going out is a simple matter, but we must learn some spiritual principles.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Because our practice of the new way is not that regulated or regular, we may work very much but reap little.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>So we must change the way.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>ENJOYING CHRIST AND BEARING FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Some saints were not happy with door-knocking and the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>They said that I was too much in activities and that it seemed there was no God, no Lord, and no Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>One saint even expressed the feeling that all the saints need to come back to the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Although it is wonderful that we have enjoyed Christ so much, I would like to check, where are the fruits?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We may enjoy Christ, but where are the fruits?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>To enjoy Christ means to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In John 15:5 the Lord Jesus said, I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Without the proper bearing of fruit, our enjoyment is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>There must be something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If a married woman has no children after three or five years, there is something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Still worse, we may have been Christians for fifteen years, yet we are without fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We cannot tolerate this kind of teaching that speaks of the enjoyment of Christ yet without fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It is altogether twisted and imbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Rather, we testify that the enjoyment of Christ issues in fruit bearing, and fruit bearing comes out of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>These two things should be here to balance us.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Although we all enjoy Christ, what kind of enjoyment of Christ do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The real check of our enjoyment of Christ is by no other way than fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 12:33 that by the fruit the tree is known cf.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Matt 7:16-20; Luke 6:43-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Furthermore, the Lord condemns barrenness in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>In the Old Testament, the Lord condemns physical barrenness Gen 30:1-2; Prov 30:16 , whereas in the New Testament, He condemns spiritual barrenness John 15:2, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Thank the Lord that in the New Testament He does not care whether we have physical children or not.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Even the Apostle Paul said how good it would be if we did not have children 1 Cor 7:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>However, if we do not have spiritual children, that is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>MAN LABORING TOGETHER WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The Bible tells us that when man tills the ground, God sends the rain Gen 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Suppose that every day the rain comes but no one tills the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>What can we reap?</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>All farmers know that, on the one hand, they have to till the ground, sow the seed, and water the crop.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>On the other hand, they must all look to the heavens for the adequate rainfall.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This is to make a living by the heavens in the Chinese expression.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>To look to the heavens does not mean to just go home and sleep day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Farmers must go to the field, till the ground, sow the seed, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Then they will reap something at harvest time.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>In the same way, without our labor God would not be able to do any work today.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Today is the day of the New Testament, and the New Testament principle is that of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>God must work together with man and in man.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>If so, then something will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Otherwise, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>If we merely teach and speak without laboring, how could we expect to gain the fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>I am looking to the Lord that here in Anaheim and in all the churches a good number will be faithful to rise up and begin to practice the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>We will see the difference after one year.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Surely each one of us can bring at least two remaining fruit to the Lord each year.</S>
