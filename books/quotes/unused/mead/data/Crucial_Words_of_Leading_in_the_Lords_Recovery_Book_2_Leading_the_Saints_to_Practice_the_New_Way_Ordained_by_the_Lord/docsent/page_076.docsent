   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEEDING TO BE AGGRESSIVE AND PATIENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN TAKING THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some local churches have a large number of elderly saints, and the leading ones in these localities hope that they can all speak and function; this may not be easy for the elderly saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to be patient with them and wait for them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In a sense, we are climbing a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The younger ones certainly will be in the front, but the older ones may not be able to keep pace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At such times, the younger ones need to exercise patience to wait for the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In carrying out the new way, we should not force people, expect too much, or want to achieve enormous success with the first try.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The elderly saints are not young in age, and it is impossible for them to be like the young people; therefore, we need to take it slowly and not be too hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, we need to work in a slow and steady way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not expect an instant success.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A quick success often implies a quick failure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A slow success, on the contrary, lasts longer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is an ancient Chinese saying: He who advances with haste will retreat with haste.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that quick progress often results in a quick withdrawal; in contrast, a steady progress that occurs little by little is the most secure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we spend five years to put the new way into practice in Taiwan, we will greatly please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The trainees among us pass through four terms of training, that is, two years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, not a single program in the secular system of education is able to perfect a talent within two years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Elementary school usually takes six years, junior high school takes three years, high school also takes three years, college requires another four years, and in order to get a masters degree, graduate school takes an additional two years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If someone has the ability, he may receive a doctorate degree after even more years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This demonstrates that there is no program of study in the world that is able to perfect someone within two years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should never expect that after four terms of training, the trainees will be specialists.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although two years of study cannot produce specialists, there is still a great difference between those who have passed through two years of the training and those who have not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if someone has finished only four years of elementary school education, he is still very different from one who has never been to school and is illiterate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not seek to advance quickly in the new way; rather, we need to take care of people s actual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The young people learn fast no matter what the subject matter is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In reference to climbing a mountain, although they may be able to reach a peak within thirty minutes, they should not leave the older ones behind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, they need to take care of the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When older people try to climb a mountain, they may need to rest for ten minutes after walking for five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Young people are able to walk fast without any rest, whereas older people need to walk and sit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They may not reach the peak in half a day; however, sooner or later they will arrive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The situation with the church is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that the responsible brothers in all the churches will exercise patience to lead the saints positively, continuing in the new way but not being too hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They should believe that the new way will eventually succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1937 Brother Nee spoke of the need to change the big meeting on the Lord s Day morning, a meeting in which one person spoke and everyone else listened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, he also said that the habit that needed to be changed was deeply and firmly constituted into the saints and that it would be difficult to overthrow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To overthrow this habit requires that everyone push in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I still remember clearly that he used the word push.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He said that slowly but surely this deeply and firmly rooted habit within us will be overturned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I believe that as long as the brothers and sisters go on faithfully and patiently, the old system on the island of Taiwan will be completely overthrown within five years.</S>
