   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CLEANSING IN THE COMING AGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Is this cleansing discipline from God restricted to this age only, or is it found also in the coming age?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From the Bible we know that death never changes anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nowhere in the Bible are we shown a case of a man changed by death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that in the future we will be with God forever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In eternity we will be the same as the Lord; we will be holy, even as the Lord is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But can we say that today we are as holy as the Lord is?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Can we say that we are worthy to be with the Lord for eternity?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The blood of the Lord Jesus has cleansed us and that the record of our sins has been wiped away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But subjectively speaking, do we have Christ living in us experientially?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have we allowed the resurrected Christ to live out from us?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our walk today is far too different from what our walk must be in eternity; the two are too far apart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we come far short of the Lord's holiness, righteousness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians today are still full of sins and filth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So then, we have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If things are so bad today but will be so good in the future, if things are so imperfect today but will be so perfect in the future, when will the change take place?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Somewhere along the way there must be a change.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are not perfect today, but will be perfect in that day, when will such a change take place?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In eternity, when we are with God and the Lamb in the New Jerusalem, we will be in the light as God is in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when will we become such ones?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The human concept is that when we die we will change.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Bible never tells us that physical death will make a person holy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was a doctrine that was preached five or six hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Bible never says that death can change a person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If death could change a Christian, then death could also change an unsaved person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But death never changes anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The slothful servant is still slothful when he is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The foolish virgins are still foolish when they wake up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they wake up, their slothfulness and foolishness have not gone away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a man is not changed in this age but will be different in the new heaven and new earth, and if death does not cause a person to change, then when does the change occur?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible shows us clearly that in the coming age there will be discipline, and this discipline will prune and cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>SOME SERVANTS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>TO BE JUDGED IN THE COMING AGE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to look at a few verses concerning this future discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Luke 12:45-48 says, "But if that slave says in his heart, My master is delaying his coming, and begins to beat the male servants and the female servants and to eat and to drink and become drunk, the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, and will cut him asunder, and will appoint his portion with the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And that slave who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes; but he who did not know, yet did things worthy of stripes, will receive few lashes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But to every one to whom much has been given, much will be required from him; and to whom much has been committed, they will ask of him all the more."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first thing in these verses that we have to decide is whether or not the slave belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Is he a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is he saved?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Surely the slave is a saved one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How can I say this?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, in the New Testament God never considers those who do not belong to Him as His slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In going from the Old Testament to the New Testament age, first, man is a slave and then becomes a son.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, in the Old Testament there are many unsaved slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in the New Testament the order is reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a man is not God's son, he is not qualified to be God's slave.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All slaves of God are sons in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the slave spoken of here is surely a saved one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a second proof that the slave in Luke 12:45-48 is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The proof is in the previous verses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verses 42-44 say, "And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom the master will set over his service to give them their portion of food at the proper time?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Truly I tell you that he will set him over all his possessions."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is the slave in these verses the same one as the slave in verses 45 and 46?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Or are there two slaves?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is only one slave.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The slave in verses 43 and 44 is the one in verse 45.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The same person can be a good slave as well as a bad slave.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This slave can have two different minds.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If he is faithful to the charge of the master of the house and would give to the household their portion of food at the proper time, the master will reward him well and will set him over all his possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if the slave says in his heart, "The master is delaying his coming; I can act any way I want," and he begins to beat the male servants and the female servants, the master will come and judge his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This proves that a saved person can both be a good slave and a bad slave.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If a saved person has unfortunately become an evil slave, what will his end be?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 46 says, "The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, and will cut him asunder, and will appoint his portion with the unbelievers."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Does this chastisement occur in this age or in the age to come?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What does the day and hour which he does not know refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They must refer to the time when the Lord will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is something in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord says that a slave can be faithful or unfaithful and that an unfaithful slave will not only miss the reward, but will also be condemned and receive a definite punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Verses 47 and 48 are based on the words of verse 46.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They tell us of the future of those who belong to the Lord and who work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>"And that slave who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes; but he who did not know, yet did things worthy of stripes, will receive few lashes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But to every one to whom much has been given, much will be required from him; and to whom much has been committed, they will ask of him all the more."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>These verses do not say that those who do not know will not receive any lashes; they only say that they will receive few lashes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There will still be the lashes.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God does not let those who do not know get by, because His word is here.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Those who know have to be responsible before God; those who do not know and who have done things worthy of lashes will still receive lashes, yet they will receive few lashes.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required from him; and to whom much has been committed, they will ask of him all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the principle of God's future chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Luke 12:47-48 settles for us the question of future chastisement of Christians before God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>My friends, I am here preaching the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When a man is saved, he is saved forever.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is an immutable fact.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, after we are saved, if our conduct is unbecoming of Christians, we will be chastised in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I am only a preacher of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I am responsible to speak only what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I am not responsible for what the Bible ought to say.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Today some may ask why Christians need to be chastised in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You can ask the Lord for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I am only saying what the Bible has said.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Let us read Colossians 3:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>"Whatever you do, work from the soul as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You serve the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>For he who does unrighteously will receive what he unrighteously did, and there is no respect of persons."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The context of this passage makes it clear that these verses refer to Christians, not to unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The preceding verses speak of how a Christian should be a wife, a husband, a father or a mother, a son or a daughter, a master or a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then Paul says that if a Christian does unrighteously, he will receive what he unrighteously did, because there is no respect of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This shows us clearly that a Christian's recompense comes at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If he does unrighteously today, he will receive a recompense according to what he has done unrighteously.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If he acts righteously, he will receive his recompense according to his righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Hence, we cannot say that Christians will not receive a certain amount of discipline and chastisement.</S>
