   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 6 Paul says, "Since it is just with God to repay with affliction those afflicting you."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse indicates that God is judging and that He will judge in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not think that God is not judging today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There may be times when it seems that our God is not active.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, atheists may say, "Where is God?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It seems to us that there is no God in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there is a God, then He must be sleeping or retired."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No, God is now judging.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>More than fifty years ago, I devoted much time to the study of the prophecies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In particular, I paid attention to the prophecies concerning the return of the Jews to their own land and to the re-formation of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As I studied world history and observed the world situation, I wondered how it would be possible for the Jews, who have been scattered over the earth for centuries, to return to their own land and once again be formed into a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, in 1948 the nation of Israel was formed and was even recognized by the United Nations.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From that time onward, and especially since 1967, the Middle East has been the focal point of the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How happy I have been to see the fulfillment of prophecies concerning the nation of Israel!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is fulfilling prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, He is actively carrying out His judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, instead of being troubled by any kind of opposition, we need to stand with God, with the One who judges those who afflict His people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As Paul says in 1:6, it is just with God to repay with affliction those who afflict His people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>RESTING AT THE UNVEILING OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 7 says, "And to you who are being afflicted, rest, with us at the unveiling of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of His power, in flaming fire."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word translated "rest" also means relief, ease, repose, liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this age the believers suffer persecutions and troubles for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the Lord's coming back they will be relieved of their sufferings and enter into the Lord's rest and enjoy its liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this verse Paul speaks of the unveiling of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord is here today; however, He is veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His coming back will be His unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the universe is immeasurably vast in its dimensions, with the Lord there is no such thing as distance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day, at His coming, He will be unveiled, and everyone will see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We thank the Lord that we are not shortsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through His grace, we have both insight and foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are able to see through the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Unbelievers, however, do not know what is behind the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we, the believers, know that the Lord Jesus will be unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the unveiling of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of His power, we shall rest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The time has not yet come for us to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our rest will be at the Lord's coming, at His unveiling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>DEALING OUT VENGEANCE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 8 Paul continues, "Dealing out vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This verse covers two conditions and two stages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It speaks of God's dealing out vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Certain people do not know God; others do not obey the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no excuse for not knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some may say, "The gospel was never preached to me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I lived before the gospel was preached."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who reason in this way will not be able to excuse themselves for not knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the Bible, God is made known through His creation Rom 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, God is made known to man's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man can know God through creation and by means of his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our conscience tells us that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For this reason, no one can say that he does not have a way to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Anyone who does not know God will suffer punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who heard the gospel but did not accept it and obey it will also be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, God will deal out vengeance to two categories of people to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel.</S>
