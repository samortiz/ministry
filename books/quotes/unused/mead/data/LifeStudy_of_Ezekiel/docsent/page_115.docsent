   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may appreciate the temple very much, but we need to realize that the temple is in the land and that without the land there cannot be a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The temple, which typifies the church, is the issue of the land, which typifies Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not have the experience of Christ, it is impossible for us to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is the issue of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A History of the Land</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the third day of the Lord s recovery of His creation, the land was recovered, for on this day the land emerged from the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Prior to that time, the land had been under the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But on the third day the Lord caused the land to rise up out of the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The land here in Genesis 1 typifies Christ, who was resurrected from the dead on the third day as the all-inclusive land.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every kind of life plant life, animal life, and human life came out of this land.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All manner of living beings issued out of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since the land signifies Christ, this means that all these living things came out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the good land which God prepared for man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, man fell and became degraded, and this caused God to judge the earth again.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Human history is a record of man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the course of this history, the descendants of Noah fell and eventually gathered at Babel to build a tower of rebellion against God 11:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth v. 8a . Later God called Abraham out from the land of Babel and brought him into Canaan, the good land 12:1-8 . Eventually, however, the descendants of Abraham fell from the good land into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The whole house of Israel went down into Egypt, and thus they lost the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Four hundred years later, by God s deliverance, the people of Israel experienced the passover, left Egypt, and passed through the Red Sea Exo 12 14 .</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the midst of the captivity, Ezekiel was brought back to the land by the Spirit and saw the land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our reading of Ezekiel, we need to pay attention to the fact that many times the Lord promised to bring His people back to the land chs.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This indicates a recovery of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is crucial for us to realize that before we can have the recovery of the building, we need to have the recovery of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The recovery of the land signifies the recovery of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ Himself cannot be lost, but in our experience Christ can be lost.</S>
