<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEM AND DANGER OF A VISION<br />
NOT MATCHING THE AGE</h2>
<p>The problem among us is that some are bound by the little experience and vision that they have. Some have said that Brother Lee is now different from Brother Nee. This is a remark made not only by those outside the Lord&rsquo;s recovery or by some who have left us but by some who are still among us. Actually, if there is anyone on this earth who knows Brother Nee, I must be that one. He fellowshipped with me all that he had seen, and I received tremendous help from him. If anyone says that my work is different from Brother Nee&rsquo;s, he is an outsider with regard to the vision. Of course, because of the lack of opportunity on his part, Brother Nee did not develop the vision as far as I have. We may use the Recovery Version of the New Testament as an example. I spent twelve years day after day writing the footnotes, yet what I wrote was nothing more than what Brother Nee had sown earlier. I can only say that the seed has sprouted and grown, although, of course, it has not grown to the fullest. I ask the Lord to give me more years so that I can develop this seed within me. If the Lord would give me another twelve years to rewrite the Life-study messages, I will have another set of Life-studies. It will not be different, but it will be new. If anyone thinks that I am different from Brother Nee, it is because such a person has not come up to the standard of the vision of the age!</p>
<p>I would like the co-workers, the elders, and all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to realize that today we have not changed. If we are different in any way from others, it is because we hold to all the visions of the Bible, from the first vision of Adam in Genesis to the ultimate, consummate one in Revelation. If anyone sees only a part of this entire vision and condemns us for being different, it is not merely because we are different from them; it is because they do not have the vision that matches the age.</p>
<p>We cannot blame those whose vision does not match the age for doing what they are doing. James was very pious. We cannot criticize him for his piety, yet he did not have the vision that matched the age. In the end he not only destroyed himself, but he destroyed the work of God and brought trouble to all the saints in the land of Judea. Because of his inertia and reluctance, the Roman prince Titus marched with his army in A.D. 70 and ransacked Jerusalem. The temple was destroyed, and not one stone was left on top of another. Josephus the historian told us the tragedy of the whole story. Many Christians were killed. Even children were murdered. Who would have wished that the whole matter end this way? However, God was forced to do this. If God had not done this, the result would have been even more unmanageable. Christianity would have become entirely mixed with Judaism. Faced with such a murky situation, God had to step in to clear the atmosphere. The fact that Jerusalem was burned to the ground and that thousands of people were killed was altogether James&rsquo;s fault. This is not a small thing. This is what the Chinese mean by &ldquo;off by a fraction of an inch, missed by a thousand miles.&rdquo; One faulty step resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of lives. History bears a tragic testimony to this.</p>
<p>Today the Lord has been merciful to His recovery. Within a short period of sixty years, He has brought us to the ultimate consummation of all the visions. I hope that all of us will seriously study the messages that we have published, especially those in the <em>Elders&rsquo; Training</em> and <em>Truth Lessons</em> series. If we study them thoroughly, we will have the full view; we will see the vision that the Lord has given us in His recovery, and we will realize what is the ultimate consummation of all the visions&mdash;the New Jerusalem. Within this ultimate consummation everything is included, such as gospel preaching, loving the Lord, the dealing and breaking of the cross, the resurrection life, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Regrettably, today on the earth, when believers see a little revelation in the New Testament, they begin to think quite highly of themselves. They become very zealous concerning that one point that they see. So naturally they think that our actions and words are too extreme. There is no doubt that many Christian groups are very busy on the earth today, but not only are they not able to be one with us; they are not able to be one with each other. They cannot be one mainly because they have different visions; they see different things. This difference is a difference in degree, although the basis is still the same. We have the same Bible, the same God, and the same Savior, and we have received the same Spirit and the same salvation. We all believe in the blood of the Lord, and we all share the same faith, but any further advance beyond this basis ends in differences. Some advance only a few steps and then stop; others advance a few steps more; and some advance even further. We thank the Lord for giving us the same basis. We are all saved, and we all have God&rsquo;s life and nature. We all have the same standing. However, while the Holy Spirit is moving on, we may remain where we are. The minute the Holy Spirit moves on, some decide to follow, but others decide to stay. The more the Holy Spirit moves on, the fewer there are who follow Him. In the end, we are the only ones left who have followed Him all the way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANSWERING THE LORD&rsquo;S CALL AND FOLLOWING<br />
THE PRESENT VISION TO BE THE OVERCOMERS</h2>
<p>Faced with such a situation, what should we do? Thank the Lord that at the end of the Bible there is the call to the overcomers. Although the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 had degraded and their condition was poor, the Lord still recognized them as churches. The Lord did not call the overcomers to leave the seven churches. Why? Because their ground was still the right ground. They were not meeting as many churches in one locality but as one church in each locality. Although the condition of Thyatira was poor, it was still one church in one locality. Its ground was still the right ground. It was corrupt, and its condition was poor, but its ground was still the right ground. This can be compared to a member of a family. Whether the family is a good one or a poor one, that person still belongs to the family. If he separates himself to begin another family and changes his name, he is splitting up the family. According to his condition, he may be very good, moral, and educated. However, as for his standing, his ground, he has caused a division. In the same way, we can say that Thyatira was poor beyond measure, yet the Lord did not ask anyone to leave the church in Thyatira, because it was still standing on the proper ground. The Lord instead called some to be overcomers in the midst of that situation.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s situation is the same. Many have seen the initial vision, and they are satisfied with what they have seen, but they should not stop there. We must follow the Holy Spirit, and we must go on, but the more we go on, the fewer there will be who follow. Hence, it is not true that we refuse to be one with others. The truth of the matter is that they will not follow. We are not only following, but we are practicing what we have seen and what we follow, which is the dispensing of the Triune God, the mingling of God and man, to become the Body of Christ to be the manifestation of the Triune God. In the process of becoming this, we experience regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</p>
