   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Proper Attitude in Telling Others</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If our intention is pure, we will know how to do this step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we must have the right spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Next, the words we speak, the way we speak them, including our attitude, countenance, voice, and tone, must all be right.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our purpose is to gain him, not just to inform him of his fault.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are simply trying to rebuke him, our rebuking may be right, and the strong words we use may be justified, but our attitude, tone, and countenance may never achieve the goal of gaining him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is easy for us to say good things about a brother; it is easy to praise a person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is also very easy to lose our temper with a person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We only need to let go of our emotions and we will lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But pointing out a person's fault and, at the same time, restoring and gaining him is something that can be done only by those who are full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One must forget about himself completely before he can be humble, meek, free from pride, and willing to help those who are at fault.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the first place one must be right himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should realize that the Lord allows a brother to offend you because He has shown favor to you and has chosen you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has put a great responsibility upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You are His chosen vessel, and God is using you to restore your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a brother offends you in a small matter and you forgive him, the matter is settled; there is no need to do anything further.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if a brother offends you to such an extent that it becomes an issue, you cannot close your eyes and say that there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The problem is there, and you cannot ignore it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the problem is not solved, it becomes a burden to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is often weakened because of these burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The life of the Body is drained through these burdens, and the work of the ministers is wasted through these burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before God we need to learn to deal with every problem when it arises.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a person offends us, we should not close our eyes and try to ignore it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must deal with it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, our spirit, attitude, word, countenance, and tone must all be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the only way to gain our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. Telling Others</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 16 says, "But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you go to him by yourself and speak to him with a proper motive, a good attitude, and gentle words, and he still does not hear you, then go and tell others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, you must tell someone else only after he has rejected your words.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must not tell others loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a problem arises between two of God's children and if both of them go to the Lord and deal with it, everything will be solved easily.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But suppose one is not careful with his words and the problem spreads to the ear of a third person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem will be compounded, and it will be hard to solve.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there is no contamination of a wound, the healing process is relatively simple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If dirt gets into a wound, not only does the level of pain increase, but the dirt makes it harder for the wound to heal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unnecessarily spreading a problem to a third person is like adding dirt to a wound.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Any problems between the brothers and sisters should be dealt with directly by the involved persons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only time we should tell another person or persons is when one party will not receive the admonition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The purpose of telling others is not to multiply the gossip but to invite others to exhort, help, and fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The "one or two more" here should be experienced persons in the Lord; they should be those who are weighty in their spiritual measure.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You should present the case before them and ask for their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They should check whether the fault lies with the offending one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The mature ones should pray and consider the matter before the Lord and then arbitrate according to their spiritual discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they feel that the fault lies with the offending brother, they should go to that brother and say, "You are wrong in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By doing this you have cut yourself off from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You must repent and confess."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"That by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The "one or two more" must not have a loose tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not invite talkative persons to such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Talkative ones can never convince people; instead, invite those who are trustworthy, honest, spiritual, and experienced before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way every word will be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses.</S>
