   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Revelation in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Revelation in the Word</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When God gives us a revelation in our spirit, we have the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the shining does not stop with God's revelation in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to retain the light with our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet our natural thoughts are not suitable for this task.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot turn our thoughts immediately into words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to ask God for further shining, not for a shining in our spirit which communicates its meaning to us, but for a shining that conveys words which translate the meaning of the light into words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see two revelations, one in the spirit and one in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The revelation in the word is a sentence or two that God gives to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we pray to God, we receive a clear light, and we are able to retain and hold on to this light; light is translated into thoughts in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yet when we try to speak to others about this revelation, we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We understand this revelation ourselves, but we cannot communicate it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can understand it a little, but we do not have the words to make it known to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At this point we should begin to pray to God for a word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should pray watchfully and comprehensively, opening our heart to Him and dropping all prejudice.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our spirit has to be open to Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we do this, we will begin to see something before God; He will give us a word or two that aptly expresses the sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just these few words become a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The words of this revelation hold God's light in place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Light is translated into cognizance and thoughts, and then the thoughts are translated into words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is right to say this, and I believe that there is no question about this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Light becomes thoughts, and thoughts are then released through us as words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Light comes to us and is retained by the thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today these thoughts are expressed through us with words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not very accurate to say that the relationship between revelation and thoughts is limited merely to a relationship between revelation in the word and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We receive words from God in the second revelation, but the words of revelation which we receive from God the second time are for the purpose of capturing the light which we see in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can say that there are two capturings in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, thoughts capture God's light, and second, the words which we receive from God also capture His light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Just as we capture the light we receive in our spirit with our thoughts, we capture light through the words which God gives to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way, the revelation we receive through the words becomes one with the revelation we have received in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What we see in our spirit goes away in an instant; but the content of this vision is not measured by time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It does not mean that if a revelation lasts for a second that the speaking will also last for just a second.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What we see in our spirit in an instant can involve many things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the reason our mind must be strong and rich in order to capture the light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we put our mind to use, the more light we will capture from God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The words we receive from God follow the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In contrast to the vast amount that is revealed to us in an instant in our spirit, God's word comes to us only in one or two sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When God gives us a sentence or two to capture the light, these sentences contain not merely words but the whole revelation behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In ordinary speech, one only needs to speak eight words if there are eight words to say, or ten words if there are ten words to say.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a speech needs to last for ten minutes, it can be finished in ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The speaking of this world can be counted by words, minutes, and seconds.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But this is not revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A word of revelation may consist only of one or two sentences, yet this word of revelation is as impregnated with riches as God's revelation is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A revelation encompasses a great amount of riches; the instantaneous shining contains many riches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God may give us one sentence only, but that one sentence is packed with God's rich utterance and overflowing revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we can receive a great amount of riches in an instant of revelation, we can also receive a great amount of riches in a single sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If God can pack His riches within a moment of revelation, He can pack His riches within one sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What one sees in an instant may require a few months to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the same way, what one receives in one sentence may require a few months to paraphrase.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we have to differentiate between the inner words and the outer words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The inner words are not long, yet they contain many riches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The riches they contain are as rich as the riches one sees in a split second.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are not given long speeches to deliver to others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What we receive may only be one or two sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet these sentences contain many spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These one or two sentences carry one outstanding characteristic they are words that release life.</S>
