<p>To hold to truth is for the purpose of growing into the Head, Christ. According to our experience, the growth here is not our growth, but it is the growth of Christ within us. This is like the words of John the Baptist: &ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease&rdquo; (John 3:30). Before we believed in Jesus, it was we who were growing. After we believed in the Lord and began to love Him, we began to decrease, and Christ began to increase within us. In the end we will be like Paul who said that &ldquo;it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). Moreover, when Christ grows within us, we grow in Him. Actually, our growth is just His growth. As a result, we decrease, and He comes in to gradually replace us, and we grow into Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">In All Things&mdash;Everything Big or Small<br />
in Our Daily Life and in Our Work</h2>
<p>In all things means in everything big or small in our daily life and in our work. Whether they are big things, small things, spiritual things, or things in our daily life, we have to allow the Lord to grow in us. We must decrease, and He must grow. Once He grows and we decrease, we will grow into Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Growing into the Head&mdash;through Acknowledging<br />
the Authority of the Headship of Christ</h2>
<p>The meaning of growing into the Head, Christ, is acknowledging the authority of the headship of Christ. We have to acknowledge Him as Lord and Head. He has the authority over us. In all things big or small we have to allow Him to be the Lord. This lesson is not easy. In our eating out in restaurants and in our shopping, seldom do we allow Him to be the Lord. Since we lack the practice in our daily life, it is not a surprise that when we come to the meeting we find it difficult to prophesy for the Lord. The key to prophesying is to allow Jesus to be the Lord. In your daily life you have to allow Jesus to be your Lord. Only then will you have the experience, and only then will you have something to say in the meetings. Christ is not only the Head of us individually; He is also the Head of the church and the Head of all things. We should acknowledge the authority of His headship in our Christian life, in the church life, and in everything. By this we will grow into Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Allowing Christ to Increase and Grow<br />
in All the Inward Parts of the Members</h2>
<p>When we grow into the Head, Christ, we are allowing Christ to increase and grow in all the inward parts of the members. Today our common problem is that we reserve a big part within us for ourselves and give the Lord only a little place. Therefore, it is impossible for Him to increase and grow within us. When He cannot grow, we cannot grow. There are many Christians on earth today; but there are few who would allow the Lord to grow within them. We must allow the Lord to have the proper place in us. We must allow Him to increase, grow, and occupy our whole being, part by part. In this way, when you grow in the Lord and I grow in the Lord, the sum total will be the growth of the Body of Christ. In other words, when Christ grows in you and me, the Body of Christ will grow. Hence, the growth of the Body of Christ is the growth of Christ in His members.</p>
<p>The purpose of our practicing the new way is for the perfecting of the saints. The meaning of the perfecting of the saints is to allow Christ to have the proper place in us and to increase in us day by day. If you allow Christ to grow in you, your gift will be manifested. As a result, Christ will not only be your life and living, but will be your gift as well. In other words, Christ will be everything to you. It is the same with our physical life&mdash;as the body grows, so does the function. We are the members of Christ. As such we must allow Christ to grow in us so that we can be perfected. This cannot be achieved by the meetings where one speaks and the rest listen. The way to be perfected is through the practice of the new way which is according to the Bible. Every point of this new way makes man decrease and supplies man with Christ, that Christ would grow in man. The more you decrease, the more Christ will increase and the more you will be perfected. Hence, the &ldquo;perfecting&rdquo; and the &ldquo;growth&rdquo; in Ephesians chapter four refer to the same thing. To be perfected is to grow in Christ.</p>
<p>In order to perfect others, we must first have the experience ourselves. We must first learn the lessons and know God&rsquo;s economy. Then we can help others to see God&rsquo;s economy. It is not a matter of improving and cultivating ourselves. It is a matter of denying our self and knowing the crucified and resurrected Lord as the Spirit who abides in us to be our life. We should live with Him, move with Him, and allow Him to be the Lord in everything. This shows us that, on the one hand, the cross has terminated our old man. On the other hand, it shows us that Christ is the Spirit of life who is now our life. The cross decreases us, and the resurrecting Spirit supplies Christ into us that we would be equipped. This is the perfecting. In the church meetings, all the prophesying should be based on this and should have this as the focus. This kind of word should be spoken frequently in the meetings. The more we speak this kind of word, the more perfecting there will be. We have to speak until all the brothers and sisters are affected in their daily lives by this kind of word. In this way they will receive the genuine perfecting.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
