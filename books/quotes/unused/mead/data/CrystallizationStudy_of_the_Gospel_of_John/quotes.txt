[3]  OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD
[4]  The Word of God here in John 1:1 refers to Christ, the only begotten Son of God v. 18 , as the definition, explanation, and expression of God: The great "I Am," self-existing and ever-existing Exo 3:14-15; John 8:24, 28, 58.
[5]  John 1 is the introduction to the whole Gospel of John, and the main stress of this introduction is that Christ is the Word of God the definition, explanation, and expression of the mysterious and invisible God.
[6]  In this introductory word, we first need to see that there are two views concerning Christ in the four Gospels.
[7]  THE WORD OF GOD 1 I. THE FIRST CRYSTAL IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
[8]  "In the beginning was the Word" this is the opening declaration of John 1:1 .
[9]  Christ is also seen in the incarnation of the invisible God to be a visible man John 1:14 , partaking of man's flesh and blood Heb 2:14 , for the redemption of the lost universe to bring in the New Testament age.
[10]  Christ as the Word speaks through the creation, through the incarnation, through His becoming the Lamb, through His becoming the Spirit, and through His being the ladder.
[11]  In His becoming the Lamb for the redemption of the lost world, Christ speaks to us how God accomplished His redemption judicially through His death as the procedure according to His righteousness.
[12]  In His becoming the Spirit for life-giving and transforming 1 Cor 15:45 , Christ speaks to us further how God carries out His economy organically by His divine life for His divine purpose according to His heart's desire.
[13]  Whoever receives the shining light, which is Christ Himself, can have the divine life, carried forth by the light, that they may be born of God to be His children as the constituents of the house of God, Bethel John 1:12-13.
[14]  This can be illustrated by Isaiah 7:14 concerning Christ being born of a virgin, Micah 5:2 concerning the birthplace of Christ, Daniel 9:26 concerning the time of the death of Christ, Malachi 4:2 concerning Christ's second appearing as the Sun of righteousness, etc. In the New Testament Christ as the Word of God was incarnated to be a man John 1:14 to express God, that is, to speak God.
[15]  B. The Life in the Word Being the Light of Man
[16]  The intrinsic, central line of the five historical events in the introduction to the Gospel of John as the "trunk" is that, first, in the Word, who is Christ as the definition, explanation, and expression of God, is life v. 4a . Then, the life in the Word is the light that speaks to the world by shining forth, as His coming to the world, what God is vv.
[17]  God has the only begotten Son as His speaking, the Word, to speak for Him and He also has the Spirit to bring forth the Word.
[18]  C. God Having Spoken to Us in the Son
[19]  OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN MESSAGE THREE GOD OUTLINE God, as the second crystal in the writings of John, is unveiled as the fountain source of life: Flowing out to dispense Himself with His divine life as the life element, the life supply Christ as the tree of life , to meet the need of His elect and to be their pleasures and satisfaction Rev 22:1-2; cf.
[20]  God is self-existing and ever-existing, without beginning and without end.
[21]  a. The Father in Heaven, the Son on the Earth,
[22]  The Father spoke in heaven concerning the Son, the Son stood in the water on the earth, and the Spirit soared as the dove in the air Matt 3:16-17 .
[23]  OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN MESSAGE FOUR THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD OUTLINE The composition of the Gospel of John and the constitution of the spiritual things recorded in this Gospel are based upon not only the Triune God but also the processed Triune God.
[24]  The processes that the Triune God has gone through: Incarnation John 1:14: To become flesh, to put on human nature by partaking of human blood and human flesh, to be a real man through human birth by a virgin Isa 7:14.
[25]  To court man according to His love John 3:16 , which He had from eternity toward man, by humbling Himself to lay aside His divine form and position to become in fashion as a man Phil 2:6-8 that He could have man engaged to Him in the church age 2 Cor 11:2 and married to Him to be His wife at the beginning of the kingdom age Rev 19:7-9 .
[26]  We have seen that the Triune God has been processed to flow as the fountain, the spring, and the river.
[27]  Every process through which the Triune God passed was a "tunnel."
[28]  This was accomplished not only by the Son but also with the Father John 8:16, 29 and through the Spirit Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 ; hence, He was called the mighty God and the eternal Father Isa 9:6 , but He was lying in a manger as a human baby Luke 2:7 .
[29]  In the process of resurrection He regenerated all His believers chosen by God in eternity past 1 Pet 1:3 by dispensing the divine life to the believers in Christ John 3:15 , germinating all believers in Christ through regeneration John 3:5-6 , and washing away all the old things from the regenerated believers Titus 3:5 .
[30]  In His perfect redemption through His death judicially and in His complete salvation by His life organically for the carrying out of God's eternal economy, He is: God, who is the source of all things and especially the source of the divine life that flows out for its dispensing into God's elect as their life and everything John 1:1, 14; 20:28; Rom 9:5; Col 2:9.
[31]  The further revelation of Christ concerning His all-inclusiveness in the Gospel of John is in addition to the items in the Old Testament unveiling the all-unlimitedness of Christ in God's commission to Him, as God's anointed One, for the universe, for fallen man, and for God's kingdom.
[32]  Christ is the Word of God that defines, explains, and expresses God, speaking and revealing God by the Spirit through the Scriptures, the prophets, and the apostles through the ages in many ways Rev 19:13; Heb 1:1-2a; 4:12; 2 Tim 3:15-17; 1 Pet 1:10-12; John 6:63 .
[33]  Christ is the life contained in Himself as the Word of God John 1:4a; 11:25; 14:6; 10:10b to be the base of a believer's life.
[34]  Christ is the tabernacle of God John 1:14b , which refers to Jesus as a man in the flesh to be God's temporary dwelling place among men on the earth.
[35]  God dwelt in Him as in the tabernacle tent in the wilderness, like the children of Israel had the tabernacle of God as God's dwelling place among them while they were wandering in the wilderness Exo 25:8-9 .
[36]  Christ as the Son of Man, in His humanity, is the ladder as the stairway, the way 14:6a , by which we can ascend from the earth to reach God heaven v. 6b . Through Him we reach God.
[37]  Christ is the eternal life John 3:15, 16, 36 .
[38]  In this book, the Gospel of John, the eternal life is the basic factor of all that Christ is.
[39]  In the enjoyment of Christ we must eat His flesh and drink His blood that we may have His eternal life John 6:54 and eat Him as the heavenly bread that we may live forever v. 58 through His word, which is spirit and life to us v. 63 . The Feast of Tabernacles John 7:2: John in his Gospel refers to us firstly the Feast of the Passover as the beginning of our enjoyment of Christ for the initiation of God's redemption judicially.
[40]  In this message and the next we want to see more points concerning the all-inclusive Christ.
[41]  These points are of three sections, and these three sections are mostly according to our participating in the Divine Trinity.
[42]  The first section is from Christ being God John 1:1 resulting in His being the spring of living water 4:14 .
[43]  In His perfect redemption through His death judicially and in His complete salvation by His life organically for the carrying out of God's eternal economy, Christ is the Feast of the Passover John 6:4; 1 Cor 5:7-8 .
[44]  First Corinthians 5:7 says that Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.
[45]  This is the enjoyment for satisfaction in drinking the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem Rev 22:1-2 .
[46]  IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN 3 OUTLINE In His perfect redemption through His death judicially and in His complete salvation by His life organically for the carrying out of God's eternal economy, He is: The Shepherd, the door, the pasture, and the flock John 10:11, 14, 16, 7, 9: Christ, with the commission He received of God to accomplish God's eternal economy, has to be the Shepherd of the flock of God, which is His Body that consummates the New Jerusalem.
[47]  We have seen that the Gospel of John can be divided into three sections according to what Christ is.
[48]  The first section in chapters one through four is on twelve items of what Christ is: God, the Word, life, light, the flesh, the tabernacle, the group of the Lamb, the Spirit, the house, and the ladder, the temple, the serpent, the eternal life, the Bridegroom, and the spring of living water.
[49]  The second section in chapters six and seven is on Christ as our enjoyment, signified by the Feast of Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles.
[50]  If I were the woman, I might say, "Lord, thank You for Your forgiveness, but how can I sin no more?"
[51]  This is why chapter eight goes on to show us how to be freed from sin.
[52]  In this chapter the Lord told us three times that He is the great I Am who can set people free from sin.
[53]  Christ, as the embodiment of God, is the resurrection all the time, even before He was resurrected.
[54]  In John 14:6 the Lord said that He is the way, the reality, and the life.
[55]  In regeneration we have received this life, and in the growth of the divine life through sanctification, renewing, transformation, etc., we participate in the reality of Christ, which is the way for us to enter into the Body of Christ, which is the Father's house that consummates the New Jerusalem.
[56]  OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN MESSAGE EIGHT THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT OUTLINE Before the consummation of the Spirit, He was: The Spirit of God in God's creation Gen 1:2.
[57]  Through the processes which the Triune God has completed, the Spirit of God as the processed Triune God has been consummated into the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit to be: "The Spirit," who was not yet before the resurrection of Christ John 7:39 , compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the compound anointing ointment Exo 30:23-25.
[58]  John's writing begins with a new point in chapter eight.
[59]  This new point is that the all-inclusive Christ who is everything to us is our Shepherd.
[60]  Now that we have covered the Word, God, and the all-inclusive Christ, we need to go on to see the consummated Spirit.
[61]  This means He is the totality of the consummated Triune God because He has gone through incarnation, human living, death on the cross, resurrection, and ascension.
[62]  The Spirit who has been consummated to be the consummation of the Triune God is the eternal Husband speaking with His bride, the Body of Christ, to be the eternal and universal couple Rev 22:17 .
[63]  He is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who ministers the bountiful supply to the believers.
[64]  Philippians 1:19 reveals that we can be saved organically in our daily life by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[65]  OF THE COMPLETE SALVATION OF CHRIST OUTLINE The church, the Body of Christ, as the bride, the wife, of Christ is the consummation of His complete salvation by His ministry in three stages with the twenty all-inclusive items of what He is, from God to the life-giving Spirit: By the judicial redemption accomplished by Christ as the flesh in His incarnation.
[66]  In this message I have a burden to give a concluding word to our fellowship concerning the all-inclusive Christ.
[67]  In the Gospel of John, the all-inclusive Christ is unveiled in twenty items, from God 1:1 to the consummated Spirit of life 20:22 .
[68]  In His complete salvation, Christ is everything to us.
[69]  Then Christ carries out His organic salvation by Himself as the life-giving Spirit in His stage of inclusion 1 Cor 15:45b .
[70]  God the Father has given His glory to the Son, and this glory is the sonship to express God in His fullness John 5:26 .
[71]  The Son, as the grain of wheat John 12:24 , expected that He would die Luke 12:50 to have His shell of humanity broken that His divine glory might be released with His divine life to produce many grains, that is, many believers as His increase for the constituting of His Body for the glorification of the Father.
[72]  The Father's house in 14:2, the vine in 15:5, and the child in 16:21, which imply the Body of Christ, are all the issues of this glorification of Christ through His death unto resurrection.
[73]  OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN MESSAGE ELEVEN THE ORGANISM OF THE PROCESSED
[74]  The Lord's most mysterious, organic speaking to the disciples is in John 14 through 16.
[75]  This took place in the night when He was betrayed and arrested, before His crucifixion, which happened the next day.
[76]  After His long discourse of mysterious speaking, He offered a prayer to God, saying, "Father,...glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" John 17:1 .
[77]  The issue of Christ's glorification is a divine and human constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with His regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified elect as an organism of the processed and consummated Triune God John 14:7-20 .
[78]  This kind of constitution is organic, with the divine life and the human life transformed with the divine life.
[79]  The Father's house for His dwelling John 14:2 refers to the divine family with the children born of God 1:12-13 and to Bethel the house of God as the place for the heavenly ladder to bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven 1:51 .
[80]  The Father's house is also the temple of God as the house of God, which was Christ Himself before His resurrection and was enlarged with His believers through His resurrection 2:16-22 .
[81]  Furthermore, the Father's house is a mutual abode for the Triune God and the believers built up by the Father and the Son 14:23 , consummating in the New Jerusalem Rev 21 .
[82]  This child delivered eventually will be the new man, whose very constituting element is Christ being all the members of the new man and in all the members of the new man Col 3:10-11 .
[83]  John 16:22 unveils that Christ is both the One who left the disciples in His death and the One who came back to the disciples as the new delivered child in His resurrection, and He will be all the members of the new man and in all of them.
[84]  The revelation of the kingdom of God in John is based upon two verses in John 3.
[85]  Verse 3 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[86]  God became flesh to enter into the human species, and man becomes God in His life and nature, but not in His divine Godhead, to enter into His divine species.
[87]  In John 3 the kingdom of God refers more to the species of God than to the reign of God.
[88]  These God-men, who are children born of God, not only constitute the house of God 1 Tim 3:15; 1 Pet 4:17; John 14:2 but also are the constituents with which the Body of Christ is built up, and the Body of Christ will consummate the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ 1 Cor 6:9; Eph 5:5; 2 Pet 1:11; Rev 11:15 .
[89]  The blood of Christ is for God's judicial redemption in His redeeming the believers Eph 1:7; 1 Pet 1:18-19 , forgiving the believers' sins Heb 9:22 , and washing away the believers' sins Heb 1:3 .
[90]  OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE APOSTOLIC MINISTRY IN COOPERATION
[91]  The entire book covers the earthly ministry of Christ, beginning with His incarnation as the Word of God to become a man in the flesh 1:1-14 and ending with His resurrection as the last Adam to become the life-giving Spirit ch.
[92]  In view of the eternal economy of God, there is the tendency through the whole writing of John to have the church of God issuing in the Body of Christ for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.
[93]  Its judicial section qualifies and positions the believers to carry out its organic section by the divine life of the processed and consummated Triune God.
[94]  The Lord's shepherding is secondly in His heavenly ministry 1 Pet 5:4 to take care of the church of God, issuing in His Body.
[95]  PETER'S IMPRESSION WITH THE LORD'S COMMISSION TO FEED HIS LAMBS AND SHEPHERD HIS SHEEP A. Telling the Believers to Return to Christ
[96]  For the shepherding of the saints, there must be the healthy teaching in the vital groups.
[97]  In 1 Timothy 3:2 Paul said that an elder should be apt to teach.
[98]  OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE KEY TO THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
[99]  The Son of Man is typified by the heavenly ladder seen by Jacob in his dream.
[100]  In John 1:51 the Lord Jesus said, "You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
[101]  Question:John 4:14b mentions the fountain and the springing up, but where is the river, signifying the Spirit?
[102]  OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE INTRINSIC SIGNIFICANCE OF JOHN 1 THROUGH 16
[103]  OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN MESSAGE SIXTEEN AN INTRINSIC INTERPRETATION OF JOHN'S WRITINGS THE INCORPORATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[104]  In John 6:63 the Lord said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."
[105]  The Word and the Spirit give us life, and the light also gives us life by shining.
