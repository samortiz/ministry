<h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 4; Gen. 22; Isa. 27:1; 2 Sam. 12:20; Psa. 132:7; Zech. 14:16-17; 2 Chron. 32:12</h1><p>Because of man's fall, worship was ruined. Without salvation man cannot worship God. John 4:23 says that "the Father...seeks such to worship Him." Who are these "such"? They are the ones who are "born anew" (3:3). The Father wants such to worship Him. John 4:24 tell us of an eternal principle: God is Spirit. Since man's spirit was poisoned, he could no longer come to God. He could have feelings and thoughts about God, but he could not worship Him. After the fall man became twisted in his feeling, reasoning, and thought.</p><p>"Those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness." The word "truthfulness" can also be translated as truth. Only that which is of the spirit is truth. Using thoughts or feelings to praise God is not worshipping in truth. According to the Old Testament, the proper worship was at Jerusalem. The sacrifice of Isaac was on Mount Moriah. The Old Testament records many times that worship should be in Jerusalem. Even in the kingdom, the nations will worship in Jerusalem. The temple, altar, and sanctuary were all in Jerusalem. Yet these were but shadows. People forgot what they spoke of. In actuality it is all a matter of the spirit. The reality of Jerusalem in God's plan is the spirit. It is not enough to worship God in Jerusalem; we must worship Him in spirit.</p><p>We must also realize the position of Jerusalem in God's plan. Jerusalem represents God's purpose; it is God's inheritance. God will inherit Jerusalem as His dwelling. Ephesians tells us that the saints are God's inheritance. However, what in us can we give to God? There is one thing which God will inherit in us; it is our free will. Satan is doing his best to hinder our free will from being occupied by God. He is doing his best to frustrate God's purpose and to destroy any worship to God. When our free will is taken up by God, we render God the proper worship.</p><p>In Jerusalem there is the temple on Mount Moriah. Where there is the reality of worship, there is the need of the cross. "And I, if I be lifted up" (John 12:32). "So must the Son of Man be lifted up" (3:14). Worship and the cross are related. If we do not know the cross, we cannot worship God. God must touch the natural life before He can secure in us the proper worship. When the cross touches man, his constitution is changed. On the one hand, we are dead with Christ, but on the other hand, the death of Christ is killing us daily. In order for God to gain our worship, we must go to the cross. The special characteristic of the cross is its stripping us of our trust in ourselves. The cross makes us dependent. If we do not take a position of dependence, we cannot worship God.</p><p>The Old Testament temple is also a type of the New Testament church. In the Old Testament, no one could worship outside the temple. the temple was the container of God. Today worship is realized in the Body of Christ. Apart from the Body, it is difficult to have the proper worship. Worship in the New Testament is a corporate matter.</p><p>Once I went to Fukien to preach the gospel, but I knew that the Lord was not in my endeavor. Yet the result was marvelous: two hundred souls were saved. Later, I read John 15:5, which says, "Apart from Me you can do nothing." It was quite hard for me to believe this verse. According to my thought, there were many things that could be done without Him. Yet we will not be judged by how much we can do, but by how much we are doing things by Him. The principle of the fall in Eden is to boast that we can do what God can do. Such an attitude must go if we are to worship God.</p><p>In the temple there is the incense altar, which signifies that everything that we are and have belongs to God. All that we have is God's. If we can say, "Lord, I want nothing for myself," God will get the glory. When all that we have is offered to God, He will gain the glory. The ultimate point of the Lord's prayer is that God gains everything. The kingdom is His, not ours or Satan's.  The power is His, and the glory is His. If we stand in this position, God will receive worship.</p><p>In summary, worship is typified by: (1) Jerusalem, which is God's central purpose, (2) Mount Moriah, which includes the dealing of the cross on our soul, and the (3) incense table, which signifies that everything that we are and have belongs to God.</p>
