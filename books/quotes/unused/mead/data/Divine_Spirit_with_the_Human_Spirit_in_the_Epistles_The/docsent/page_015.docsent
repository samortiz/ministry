   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PLEDGING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Third, verse 22 speaks of the pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The pledge is the proof, guarantee, and down payment that all that God is, is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The seal means that we belong to God, and the pledge guarantees that God belongs to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seal declares that we are God s, and the pledge declares that God is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has given us the Holy Spirit within as a down payment of our future enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit within us today is the firstfruit and foretaste of our enjoyment of Him, guaranteeing that God will give us the full enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has anointed His ingredients into us, and He has sealed us with Himself as a mark.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In addition, He has put the Holy Spirit within us as a down payment, a guarantee, and a deposit to ensure that all that God is, is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the work of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The anointing, the sealing, and the pledging are all for the purpose of transforming us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more God anoints us, the more He seals us, and the more we enjoy the pledging Spirit, the more we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE INSCRIBING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TO WRITE LIVING LETTERS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter 3 reveals the Spirit in five aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, verse 3 says, Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit here is the writing Spirit to write Christ into us, and our heart is the tablet for the inscribing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are the living letters, and the story written on these letters is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, the writer of these letters is the Spirit through the apostles, and the ink also is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The indwelling Spirit is continually writing something of Christ upon our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ today has come into our spirit, but He may not yet be written on our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our heart mainly surrounds our spirit, being composed of our mind, emotion, and will, in addition to our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, for the Spirit to write Christ on us as living letters means that He writes Christ into our mind, emotion, and will; that is, the Spirit takes our whole heart as the tablet for inscribing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As He does this, we become a complete epistle of Christ, and people can read Christ upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When people read our mind, emotion, and will, they will say, Every bit of this person is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His thought is Christ, his love is Christ, and even his hating is Christ Rev 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, his deciding is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His deciding to keep something is Christ, and his deciding to reject it also is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am afraid that sometimes people cannot read Christ upon our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they read our heart, they may read only our car or our bank account.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is written on our mind, emotion, will?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Has Christ been written on, that is, wrought into, our heart?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To inscribe Christ in our heart is the work of the transforming Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The transforming Spirit is waiting for the opportunity to write Christ into our mind, emotion, and will to make us complete epistles of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The indwelling Spirit, who is the transforming Spirit, is doing the work of writing in us, but we need to give Him our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must let Him have the free course to write something into our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE MINISTERING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 6a goes on to say, Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As ministers of the word today, we must be the good writers of Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that we must minister Christ to people to cause those who listen to our message to become the living epistles of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit indicates that the Spirit here is the ministering Spirit to minister, to write, Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 8 also speaks of the ministry of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 6b continues, For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here the Spirit is the life-giving Spirit to always impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Life includes satisfaction; to be satisfied means that we are full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Life also includes strength; to be weak means that we are short of life, but to be full of strength means we are full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In addition, to be in the light and full of light means that we are full of life, but to be in darkness means that we are short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we have rest, comfort, and peace, that also means that we have life, but to be short of these indicates that we are short of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The life-giving Spirit always ministers life and the life supply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE LIBERATING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 17 says, And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Spirit in verse 17 refers to the Spirit who gives life in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verse 17 the Spirit is the liberating Spirit, liberating us from every kind of bondage, particularly from the bondage and veiling of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By the work of this liberating Spirit we are released from any kind of covering and bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have been liberated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we still need to give Him the ground, the opportunity, and the free course to do His liberating work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This verse says, Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that He must be with us and He must have the ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If He is not with us, we do not have freedom; if He does not gain the ground in us, we cannot obtain freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the other hand, if the ground in us is His, the freedom is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is the liberating Spirit, liberating us from every kind of bondage, suppression, oppression, and occupation, but we must give Him the ground in us.</S>
