   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The content of this message is much more difficult than that of the foregoing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many in the past have used the term the great commission to describe the Lord's charge to His disciples before He ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But in this message we want to pick up a deeper understanding and application of this term.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The great commission of Christ is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In resurrection is a critical phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ's commission is found nowhere else except in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Outside of His resurrection He has no commission.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Christ who gave the great commission is the One in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is not only in resurrection; He Himself is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. THE CHRIST IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to see what resurrection is, we need to see that the Lord's ministry in its history has three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is new light to us from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We call these three stages the three i's: incarnation, inclusion, and intensification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first stage is the stage of incarnation, from His human birth to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In that stage the Lord was in the flesh, but He worked and moved by the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, He was conceived in Mary's womb by and with the Spirit Matt 1:18, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then Matthew 4:1 says that Christ was led by the Spirit to the wilderness to be tempted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew 12:28 reveals that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hebrews 9:14 says that He offered Himself to God on the cross through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows that when Christ was in the flesh, He was also in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ did everything in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In John 5:19 and30 He said that He did not do anything from Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, He lived by the One who sent Him John 6:57a .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 14:10 the Lord Jesus said, "The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The One who works when the Son speaks is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our crystallization-study of John we pointed out that not only His resurrecting of Lazarus but also everything that Christ did was the exercise of Himself as resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He was in the flesh, He had a human part of His being which was not resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever is human is not resurrection, but whatever is divine is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was in the flesh, and at the same time He was also in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He lived in the flesh but He did not live by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He lived by another factor, another source, that is, by the One who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The One who sent Him was the Father, who is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That Divine One is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then when Christ passed through death and entered into resurrection, He uplifted His human part into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 1:3 through 4 says that Christ as the seed of David in the flesh was designated the Son of God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To designate is to uplift His human part into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In resurrection He was born to be the firstborn Son of God; as the seed of David He was designated to be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Also, through His resurrection we were regenerated, begotten of God, to be the many sons of God 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In regeneration God begets gods, who are His children in His life and nature but not in His Godhead John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because our humanity has been uplifted, resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ephesians 2:5 and 6 reveal that we were made alive and resurrected together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Resurrection means to uplift our humanity into divinity, from the level of humanity to the level of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A. The Christ in His Incarnation 1.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To Bring God into Man</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Resurrection means divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Incarnation means humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ becoming a man was His entering into the stage of incarnation by bringing divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is to bring God into man, making God and man one, as one entity, one person, one God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was unprecedented in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There was no one before Christ who was one entity of divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To Live in Humanity to Express God</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ lived in humanity to express God, especially to express the attributes of God in His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although He was in humanity, He did not express humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He expressed divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He especially expressed the attributes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's attributes are what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When these attributes were expressed in Christ's humanity, they became His human virtues.</S>
