   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW COVENANT 4 Issue No. 26 Scripture Reading: Matt 26:28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen what a promise is and what a fact is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This morning we will see what God's covenant is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A covenant includes a promise and a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we will consider in detail what the new covenant includes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has never established a covenant with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was no old covenant and no new covenant with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before the new covenant, of necessity, there was another covenant that became old; hence, the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This point relates to biblical knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Originally I had no intention of mentioning this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But, for the sake of helping those who want to study the Bible more and want to understand the origin of the covenant, I have to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Bible the new covenant is strictly for the Jews, the people of Israel; it is not for the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jeremiah 31:31 says, "Behold, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse is the first mention in the whole Bible of God's making a new covenant with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Notice that the covenant was made between God and the house of Israel and the house of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What time does "after those days" in verse 33 refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most people believe that it refers to the beginning of the millennium at the end of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They believe that God will not make a new covenant with the Israelites until that time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If this were the case, God has not made a new covenant with us because He has yet to make a new covenant even with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please note that only Christ's special grace allows us to participate in the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible clearly says that when the Lord Jesus died, He shed His blood for the enactment of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This blood is the blood of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The time for enacting the new covenant between God and the Jews, as mentioned by Jeremiah, will be at the end of the tribulation and the beginning of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, the writer of the book of Hebrews applied Jeremiah's word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew 26:28 says that the Lord's blood is the blood of the new covenant, and Hebrews 8:8-13 says that the new covenant belongs to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How can we explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to realize that God made a covenant with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not make a covenant with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as Abraham was justified by faith, we are also justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today we can similarly enjoy the future new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are doing what the Israelites will do in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has put us under the blessing of the new covenant today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Romans Paul told us that a man, through faith, could participate in the covenant God made with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The same principle applies in obtaining the covenant that God will make with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as we follow the footsteps of Abraham, we will receive the covenant that God gave to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as we trust in the same thing that the Israelites, in the future, will trust in, we will receive the future covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Zechariah says that the people of Israel will one day come, believe, and acknowledge Jesus as their Savior, not just as their Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we believe in the Lord Jesus, as the Jews will believe in the future, God will put us in His new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we believe what Abraham believed, we will receive Abraham's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we believe now what the Israelites will believe in the future, we will receive what the Jews will receive in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can see clearly that the time for realizing the new covenant is in the future at the beginning of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through the Lord Jesus' death for us, we now have a foretaste of the blessing of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no doubt about this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to pay attention to what the new covenant is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the time God spoke about enacting the new covenant through Jeremiah to the time the Lord Jesus established the new covenant, how many years were there?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The time span was very long; it was a few hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>During these few hundred years, the new covenant was just dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a pity that many Jews did not receive the blessing of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although God's covenant was written out, placed before them, and they had read about God's making a new covenant with the people of Israel, they did not know how they could obtain this new covenant, nor did they receive the blessings of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thank the Lord that He did not mention a covenant throughout most of His lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He did not speak of a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All He did was cast out demons, heal the sick, feed men by multiplying loaves, and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our Lord worked quietly, day after day and year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then one night, when He was alone with a few disciples at dinner, He suddenly brought up a covenant which was very old, buried, concealed, and completely forgotten, but was still very precious, reliable, and signed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was a covenant that had never been used or claimed by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Suddenly the Lord declared that the cup was His blood, which was shed for the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From the time He came to the earth to the time He died, the central thought occupying the Lord Jesus was enacting the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But until that night He had not explicitly mentioned that He was going to fulfill this covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He said then that the blood He was to shed was for the enactment of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today man has forgotten the full gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Most people say that the Lord Jesus shed His blood to redeem man from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Truly, the blood of the Lord was shed for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But at the same time, it was also shed for the enactment of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the Lord had not died and His blood had not been shed, the new covenant would not have been accomplished, and God could not have made a covenant with us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Truly, the Lord shed His blood for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But redemption is not the final goal of the shedding of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Redemption is only a means and a way to reach the final goal.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The final goal is the enactment of the new covenant and the bestowal of the blessing of the new covenant on us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Our sins are forgiven through the blood of the Lord, but the purpose of His shedding the blood was for the enactment of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We know that without the shedding of blood, there is no redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hebrews 9:22 says that without shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Redemption and the enactment of the covenant are very intimate and closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, there is a distinction between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers and sisters, please remember that God made a covenant to give us knowledge, life, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because our sins are not yet cleansed, we do not receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Sin lies between us and God, and separates us from the knowledge, life, and power that God wants to give us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All of our sins before God must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The way to remove the sins before God is not by our work, merit, or future improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If our sins are not dealt with and removed before God, He cannot forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Thank the Lord that He has been crucified for our sins; He has shed His blood, has resurrected from the tomb, and ascended to God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God is fully satisfied in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Therefore, He must forgive us.</S>
