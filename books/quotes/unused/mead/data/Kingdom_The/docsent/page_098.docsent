   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BAPTIZED INTO THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Matthew 28 there is the seed of baptism into the Triune God, and in the Epistles there is the growth of the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already referred to Romans 6:3, which says that we have been baptized into Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 12:13 tells us two things: "In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not simply a matter of being put into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we have been put into the Triune God, we become the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The charismatic movement stresses speaking in tongues, but neglects the point that the genuine baptism in the Holy Spirit is to produce the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you have had a genuine experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, you will be for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You will not be content with individuality; you will care for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not every experience of speaking in tongues is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the experience is genuine, the person will care for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The real baptism in the Spirit is for the producing of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Body is a strong test as to whether or not the baptism we have experienced is genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Matthew 13 the seed grows and brings in transformation, and transformation issues in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the building?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The building is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although I have no intention of criticizing anyone, I must speak the truth to say that many tongues-speaking people do not have the transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I saw many who were the same in China.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Three times we practiced Pentecostalism in our churches, and each time it was a debit to our spiritual accounting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We did have some credit, but eventually our spiritual accounting was "in the red," showing more debit than credit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We suffered a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, all the co-workers spontaneously made the decision to drop the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We did not continue that "business" because it gave a poor return.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I should not say that there is no profit in the Pentecostal things, but the loss is greater than the gain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both in China and in this country I have seen the damage caused by the "Pentecostal" things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TESTS OF THE GENUINE BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The genuine baptism in the Holy Spirit must be checked by several points: the growth in life, the transformation in life, the building up in life, and the practical Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan is very subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one will attempt to cheat you with counterfeit money that is obviously false, but they will use a counterfeit currency so similar to real currency that only experts can discern the difference.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the best protection is not to accept currency at all but to accept only gold.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not think that you are smart enough to discern the counterfeit from the true.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Few of us are that smart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, in the long run and for the safety of the church, it is better not to take any "currency."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just take the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some may occasionally take the "currency."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But you must warn them not to use "currency" too much or they will be cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is true not only for tongues-speaking, but also for all the other gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The gift of knowledge must also be proved by the growth in life, the transformation in life, the building in life, and the practical Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not only the situation today; it was also the situation when the Lord Jesus was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 2 tells us that the Lord did many miracles in Jerusalem and, as a result of these signs, many people believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, He did not commit Himself to those who were drawn by the miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John 3 Nicodemus came and the Lord turned him to the matter of life, saying that he needed to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a matter of miracles, but of being born again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Nicodemus came to the Lord Jesus, his concept was that of knowledge and he called the Lord "Rabbi."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God" John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the Lord Jesus told him, "You must be born anew" John 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not a matter of miracles or of knowledge; it is a matter of receiving a new life by rebirth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The local churches need one thing: life with its growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually this life will produce the Body.</S>
