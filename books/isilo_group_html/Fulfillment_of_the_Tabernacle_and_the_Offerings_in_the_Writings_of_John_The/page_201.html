This reproduction is illustrated by a grain of wheat that falls into the ground, dies, and grows in order to be multiplied. The many grains brought forth by the one grain are the multiplication of that grain.<p>A father is one who multiplies himself through the begetting of children. A man&#8217;s children are his multiplication and reproduction. In the same principle, as children of God, we are God&#8217;s reproduction. Concerning this, 1:12 and 13 say, &#8220;But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name; who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&#8221; According to these verses, whoever receives the one who came as God incarnate and tabernacled among us will be given the authority to become a child of God, His reproduction. As a result of the coming of the Lord Jesus, millions of children of God have been produced.<p>We have seen that the Gospel of John does not emphasize the redemption of the Lord Jesus, but instead emphasizes the multiplication brought forth by the Son of God. According to 12:24, the Lord brought forth this reproduction by falling into the ground as a grain of wheat to die. The Lord Jesus died on the cross to bring forth the multiplication, the reproduction, of Himself. According to the synoptic Gospels Christ died for redemption, but according to the emphasis in John&#8217;s Gospel, He died for the purpose of multiplication.<h2 class=head2>Divine Glorification</h2><p>We have seen that after the resurrection of Lazarus, the crowd welcomed the Lord Jesus and wanted to exalt Him. However, the Lord did not come for human exaltation; He came instead for divine glorification. This glorification required Him to pass through the process of death and resurrection. The five and a half chapters from the middle of chapter twelve to the end of chapter seventeen are all on one subject-the glorification of the Lord Jesus. What is the Lord&#8217;s glorification? His glorification is His multiplication. From 12:23 to the end of chapter seventeen we see that Jesus, the Nazarene, had to pass through death so that He might be multiplied in His resurrection. This multiplication is His glorification.<p>Suppose a certain brother has twelve sons. These sons would be the brother&#8217;s multiplication and glorification. If we saw this brother surrounded by all his sons, we would realize that with him there is multiplication, and that this multiplication is his glorification.<p>The matter of multiplication as glorification revealed in chapters twelve through seventeen has been neglected by Christians throughout the centuries. Nevertheless, these chapters definitely speak of the Lord&#8217;s glorification. When the people wanted to exalt Him, the Lord said, &#8220;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified&#8221; (12:23). In order for the Son of Man to be glorified, it was necessary for Him to die and be multiplied. In 12:28, the Lord Jesus went on to pray, &#8220;Father, glorify Your name.&#8221; For the Father to glorify His name is for Him to glorify Himself, for the Father&#8217;s name denotes His Person. Then in 12:32 the Lord went on to say, &#8220;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.&#8221; For the Lord to be &#8220;lifted up&#8221; means that He was put on the cross. When He was lifted up, He drew all men to Himself. All those who have been drawn to Him are His multiplication.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_200.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_202.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 201</div><br></body></html>
