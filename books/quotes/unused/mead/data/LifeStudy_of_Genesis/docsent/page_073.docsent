   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Enabling Man to Receive God as Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This tree enables man to receive God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can we prove this?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The following books of the Bible reveal that God is life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the tree of life in the garden was the indicator that God intends to be our life in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day, according to the Gospel of John, God came in the flesh John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Him was life John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The life displayed by the tree of life in Genesis 2 was the life incarnated in Jesus, God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jesus told us that He Himself is life John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, John 15 tells us that Christ is a tree, the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, He is a tree; on the other hand, He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we put together all these portions from John, we see that Jesus is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus said that He is the bread of life, meaning that He has come to us as the tree of life in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not easy to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let me ask you a question: how tall was the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you turn the question to me, I will answer that it was not taller than I. I answer this way because Adam, who had been placed before the tree of life, probably was not much taller than I. If the tree of life had been of a great height, its fruit would have been out of reach.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Adam and Eve had no ladder or other instrument to use in plucking the fruit of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, I believe the tree of life was not very tall.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Almighty God, Jesus is high, but when He came to us as food He was lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was a loaf of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was even the crumbs under the table Matt 15:21-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The very Jesus who came to us as life in the form of food was not tall and great; He was small and lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anything we eat must be smaller than we are; if it is not, we cannot take it into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if our food is larger than we are, it must be cut into pieces small enough to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, Jesus came to us as life in the form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "I am the bread of life," and, "He who eats Me shall also live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God in the Son is the tree of life that is good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Day after day we can feed on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3 Typifying Christ</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The tree of life typifies Christ who imparts life to man and who pleases and satisfies man cf.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 15:1; Exo 15:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ imparts divine life into us, pleases us, and satisfies us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many of us can testify of this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jesus has imparted life to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He satisfies me all the time."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>5 With a "River"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Along with the tree there is a river Gen 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since the tree is a tree of life, the river must also be related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the end of the Bible we also see a river of life flowing and a tree of life growing Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the beginning and the end of the Bible we find the tree of life and a river flowing with living water.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Scriptures the concept of the river is also crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the Scripture mentions man, both in the beginning and at the end, it also mentions the river.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For man to receive God as life, to enjoy the fatness of God, to quench thirst, to be watered, to grow, and to rejoice, all depends on the river cf.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Psa 36:8-9; 46:4; 65:9; Exo 17:1-7; Joel 3:18; Zech 14:8; John 4:14; 7:37-38; Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you take in the Lord Jesus, you immediately have the deep sensation of something watering you from within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Something is flowing within you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Have you not had such an experience?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever you say, "Lord Jesus, I love You," or whenever you pray to the Lord this means that you receive Him into you once again you sense something flowing within you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every morning you should take Christ as your breakfast, every noon you should take Him as your lunch, and every evening you should eat Him as your dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You need to feed on Christ at least three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you do this, the water of life will water you inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You will never be dry.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps you work at an office all day and arrive home from work tired and worn, feeling quite dry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you take Jesus as your dinner, living water will flow within you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"A river went out of Eden to water the garden."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This flow will discharge many old things out of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Both our experience and the divine record in the Bible tell us that this river is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although Genesis 2 appears to be a record of creation, it was actually written according to the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The tree of life and the flowing river indicate this: whenever we take Jesus into us as food, that food will impart divine life, a life that is a watering and flowing life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Revelation 22:1-2 we see that the river of life with the tree of life growing in it proceeds out of the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This picture is a further proof that the tree of life and the river of life represent the genuine experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whenever we take God in Christ as our life, we will have this river flowing within us to water us and work many things within us.</S>
