   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There must be the sound of praise and singing in the early morning.</S>

   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we offer our highest praise to God, our spirit rises to the highest peak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>C. Read the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The early morning is the time for us to gather the manna which is Christ .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does it mean to eat the manna?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It means to enjoy Christ, to enjoy God s Word, and to enjoy His truth early in the morning every day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After we eat the manna, we have the strength to journey in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The early morning is the time to gather the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One will not be fed spiritually or be satisfied if he spends his early morning on other things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have mentioned already that we should have two Bibles, one with marks and notes in it to use in the afternoon and the other with nothing in it for eating manna early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the early morning, do not read too much and do not take many portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, read a single portion of the Bible carefully, always mingling your reading with unceasing communion with God and singing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This does not mean that you should fellowship with God first, praise second, and then read the Bible last.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to blend all these things together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the same time you should also pray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Come to God s presence and open His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As you read, you may be convicted to confess your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As you read certain portions, you may be touched by His grace to offer up thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You can also pray to God concerning what you have read in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You can say, Lord, this is truly what I need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This portion, this verse, this word, truly exposes my lack.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord, fill up this lack of mine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you find a promise, you can say, Lord, I believe in this promise.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You can also intercede.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While you are reading, you may remember the condition of those who fall short of what this portion says.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should not accuse or criticize them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, you should pray, God, fulfill this word in me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Fulfill this word also in my brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You can confess your sins and the sins of others.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can give thanks for yourself and for others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Your Bible reading in the morning should not be too long; it should not cover too much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Two, three, four, or five verses are sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You can dwell on them for an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As you read these verses word by word, pray over them, and commune with God through them, you will be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, there were people who fellowshipped with God this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They knew God and communed with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Their fellowship with God became part of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Psalms David interchanged the pronouns you and He freely.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At one moment he would be speaking to man, and at the next moment he would be praying to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the same psalm, he would say a few sentences to man and then say something to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, David spoke to man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the other hand, he spoke to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Psalms show us that David was a person who was in constant fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While Nehemiah was working, he would speak a few words and then offer a short prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the king asked him something, he would speak to the king first and then to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He mingled his work and prayer together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He did not separate his work from his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul wrote the book of Romans to those in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, more than once he turned his speaking to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A few times he seemed to have forgotten the fact that he was writing to the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It seemed as if he were talking to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can find frequent examples like this in Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In an instant he could turn around and speak to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who have read the autobiography of Madame Guyon will notice one characteristic of hers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Most autobiographies are written for man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But in Madame Guyon s autobiography, she spoke to man in one instant and to God in the next instant.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In one moment she would be speaking to LaCombe who asked her to write her autobiography , and at the next moment she would be speaking to God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One does not know where fellowship with God begins and where it ends.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Fellowship does not mean to set aside other affairs to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nor does it mean to pray first and then deal with the affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is to do both simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, during this early morning hour of gathering manna, you should learn to mingle prayer with God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You should learn to mingle praise and fellowship with God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One moment you may be on earth, but the next moment you are in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One moment you may be in yourself, but the next moment you are in God.</S>

   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many brothers and sisters are weak and unable to take the wilderness journey.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to ask them, Have you eaten anything?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They cannot walk because they have not eaten enough.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Manna is gathered in the early morning.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is why we need to rise up a little earlier.</S>
