<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(10)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:2, 23; 15:4a, 5a</h1><p>In the three foregoing messages we covered the signs of the divine Trinity and of another Comforter. Concerning the divine Trinity, we covered forty-seven points related to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the consummation. We may also say that the Father is the Originator, the Son is the Accomplisher, and the Spirit is the Applier. In addition, we have the full realization of the Triune God. Therefore, we have seven important terms: source, expression, consummation, Originator, Accomplisher, Applier, and realization.<h2 class=head1>THE TWOFOLDNESS OF DIVINE TRUTH</h2><p>Before we go on to consider the fifth sign, the sign of the abode, I would like to say a word concerning the twofoldness of divine truth. With all biblical truths there is the matter of twofoldness; that is, with each truth there are two aspects. Even with God we can see twofoldness. On the one hand, God is one; on the other hand He is three. Hence, God is triune, three-one.<p>God is divine, spiritual, and mysterious. Nevertheless, with God there is a physical aspect. Even though He is spiritual, yet there is a physical aspect with Him. The Gospel of John emphasizes the spiritual and divine aspects of God. But in the book of Acts we can see the physical aspect of the Trinity. As far as the spiritual aspect is concerned, Christ today dwells within us. He lives in us in a mysterious way. Although the indwelling of Christ is a mystery, it is nonetheless a reality. We all can testify that we have the Son of God living in us. However, according to the book of Acts, Christ has ascended to the heavens in a physical way (Acts 1:9). His ascension was a physical event, and this event was seen by His disciples in a physical way. They saw the Lord Jesus literally ascending to the heavens. What they beheld was not a phantom, but a man with a solid, physical body. This is clearly portrayed in chapter one of Acts. Furthermore, according to Acts 3:21, Christ must remain in the heavens until the millennium, the time of restitution: “Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” Therefore, physically speaking, Christ is no longer on earth, but in the heavens. Nevertheless, spiritually speaking, Christ dwells within us. Here we have two aspects—the spiritual aspect and the physical aspect.<p>When you speak to others about the Triune God dwelling in you, they may respond by pointing out that according to Acts 1 the Lord Jesus has ascended to the heavens and that according to Acts 3 He must remain there until the times of the restitution of all things. Then they may warn you not to listen to anyone who teaches you that the Triune God abides in you. If you encounter such a situation, you may say, “I certainly believe what is written concerning the Lord in Acts 1 and 3. However, I would remind you that the Gospel of John comes before the book of Acts. Let us study chapters fourteen through seventeen of John’s Gospel and see what these chapters reveal concerning the Triune God. In particular, I would like to point out how in these chapters we have the source, the expression, the consummation, the Originator, the Accomplisher, the Applier, and the realization.” This is the way to fight for the truth. In fighting for the truth, we do not trust fleshly weapons. Instead, our trust is in the pure Word of God.<p>When we face opposition to a particular biblical truth, we need to remember the twofoldness of divine truth. Even our constitution as human beings is an illustration of the twofoldness of truth, for we have a physical part and also a psychological and spiritual part. Medical doctors may study our physical body, but they may not know much about our psychological part and virtually nothing about our spirit. This illustration indicates that it is not sufficient to know any truth in only one aspect. Even the paper on which this message is printed has two sides.<p>Nothing can exist with only one side. For example, we have both day and night. If we had day without night, I doubt that any living thing could exist. In order for life to exist on earth, there is the need for both day and night. This simple illustration points to the fact that there are always two aspects of the truth. For instance, God is one and three, three-one. The Spirit of God is one and also seven (Rev. 1:4). Therefore, let us learn to study the twofoldness of the divine truth.
