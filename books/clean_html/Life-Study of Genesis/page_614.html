<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. God Being the Light,<br>and the Lamb Being the Lamp</H2><P>In the eternal dwelling God within us will be our light, and Christ will be our lamp to express the very God who is within us (Rev. 21:11, 23; 22:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. God's Throne Being the Source of Supply</H2><P>Revelation 22 says that we may enjoy God's throne. When He dwells in us, His throne is with us, right within us. Therefore, we have the throne, the authority of God, as the source of supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The River of Water of Life<br>with the Tree of Life Being the Supply</H2><P>Out of the throne of God flows the water of life with the tree of life in it as the supply (Rev. 22:1-2). If we have God dwelling in us, we have the life supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. God's Authority, Face,<br>and Name Being the Chief Enjoyment</H2><P>In the New Jerusalem we shall participate in His authority and enjoy His face and His name (Rev. 22:3-4). We shall see His face all the time, and His name will be on our forehead forever. This will be our chief enjoyment in the New Jerusalem.</P><P>These are different aspects of God's dwelling in us. We do not need to wait for the New Jerusalem to experience them. Even today we can experience all these things. However, when we enter the New Jerusalem we shall discover something new. We may say, "Oh, we have never experienced these things in such a way. Now we are discovering something that we never thought we could experience."</P><P>At the end of chapter forty-nine there are no more sinners, no more Reuben and Simeon. Instead, there is Joseph, indicating that God has become our blessing, and Benjamin, indicating that we have become God's dwelling place. Because Benjamin was the place of God's dwelling, he enjoyed God's presence. Benjamin enjoyed safety, and God enjoyed Benjamin as His dwelling place. God has become our blessing, and we have become God's dwelling place. Whatever God is, whatever God has, and whatever God can do becomes our enjoyment and blessing; and whatever we are and have becomes God's dwelling place. Eventually, God and we, we and God, become one. In the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem there are no more sinners and no more sea, death, weakness, sickness, tears, sorrow, pain, or night. Everything is God. God is a blessing to us, and we are a dwelling place to God. We enjoy Him, and He enjoys us. This is the ultimate consummation of Jacob's prophetic blessing upon His twelve sons. Today we are these twelve sons enjoying God to the uttermost and becoming God's dwelling place. Therefore, we can enjoy God, and He can be in us to enjoy all that we are to Him.</P>
