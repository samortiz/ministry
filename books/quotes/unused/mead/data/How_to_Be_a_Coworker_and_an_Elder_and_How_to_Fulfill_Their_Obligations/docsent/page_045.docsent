   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX HOW TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE CO-WORKERS AND ELDERS 3 OUTLINE Work with God 1 Cor 3:9 to carry out His divine building in three aspects for the accomplishment of God's eternal economy: Establishing and shepherding the churches by the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit, with His organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Building and constituting the Body of Christ by Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit with His sevenfold intensified organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Adorning and consummating the New Jerusalem with God the Father as its golden base, God the Son as its pearl gates, and God the Spirit for its wall of precious stones, by drinking the Spirit, the flowing Triune God, as the river of water of life and eating Christ, the overcoming Lion-Lamb, as the tree of life with His rich and fresh supply.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prayer: Our God, our Lord, we truly worship You, extol You, and praise You.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You are the God who is forever new; You never grow old and never fade away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May we receive from You the constant and daily renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, save us from oldness, from the old creation, from our old "I," from our old man, and from everything old.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, may we be like Your apostle Paul, forgetting the things that are behind, leaving everything that is old behind us, and endeavoring to go forward for the prize to which You have called us upward, which is Your dear Self.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank You for leading us through the past five meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this last meeting we pray that You would give us a simple and clear conclusion, even the best conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Give us the words, the utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank the Lord, in this conference I sense that we have touched the main points and have covered what the Lord wants us to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this we worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the preceding two chapters we saw that when we are fulfilling our obligations as co-workers and elders, we need to beware of certain things that can frustrate and damage us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this concluding chapter I have only one clear and simple burden to fellowship with you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is concerning how to work with God in fulfilling our obligations as co-workers and elders to carry out the divine building.</S>
