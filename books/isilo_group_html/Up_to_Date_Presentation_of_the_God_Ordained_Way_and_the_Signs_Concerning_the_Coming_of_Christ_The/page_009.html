But after Moses, they were rendered corporately. God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt through Moses that they might become a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). From that time on, the worship that God desires of His people has no longer been individual but corporate. God did not annul the individual worship, but the individual worship is not the goal that God desires to obtain. God's eternal plan, or economy, is to have a corporate worship. It is not to have many corporate worships separately; rather, it is to have one great, universal, corporate worship among tens of thousands of God's people. From the time of Moses, this kind of worship continued for fifteen or sixteen hundred years among the children of Israel.</P><P>In the Old Testament the worship rendered to God by His people was formed according to the Mosaic law. That corporate worship was merely an empty shell; it was short of the content of reality. It developed to the extent that the worship of the children of Israel had only a name but did not have the reality, and it fell altogether into outward forms. Thus, it lost the presence of God, even God Himself, the One who was the real content and center of their worship. All their actions in worshipping God were not only vanity but were even detested by God.</P><P>In the New Testament we see in the Lord Jesus and in His forerunner, John the Baptist, that the worship that God desires is beyond our imagination, for it is altogether not a matter of formality. The Jews who studied the Old Testament all knew that the Messiah would come and that prior to His coming His forerunner, Elijah, would come to pave the way for Him. However, when Christ and His forerunner came, the Jews did not recognize them. Although the Jews expected the Messiah to come according to the Old Testament prophecies, they interpreted the Scriptures in letters and in forms, and thus they were mistaken and missed Him.</P><P>John the Baptist was the Elijah promised by God in the Old Testament (Matt. 11:14). At his conception, it was spoken concerning him that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:17). He was born into a priestly family; his father Zachariah was a priest who took the lead in his course of priestly service. According to what was ordained by the law, John was to inherit his father's priesthood and serve in the holy temple, wear the priestly robe, and eat the priestly food. However, when he grew up and began his ministry, what he did was altogether different. He put on a garment of camel's hair and wore a leather girdle about his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey. All these things are uncivilized, uncultured, and contrary to the religious regulations. He altogether abandoned God's Old Testament dispensation, which had fallen into a kind of religion mixed with human culture. His intention was to introduce God's New Testament economy.</P><P>In Christ we also see something extraordinary. When Christ was born, although the priests and scribes had the knowledge concerning the birth of Christ, they did not see the vision, nor did they have the heart to seek after Christ; thus, they missed Him and did not gain Him. Although the Bible knowledge they had was accurate, it was in dead letters. This calls to mind the situation of Christianity. Christianity preaches Christ, but it has deviated in its preaching of Christ, having only the name of Christ but not the reality. What is left is nothing but an empty shell, void of Christ as the content. As early as the third or fourth century, Constantine the Great of Rome adopted Christianity as the state religion, and from that point on, the "church" became detached from Christ. It became something in name only, without Christ as its content, something that is mixed with the world. Christ in His ascension is altogether heavenly, yet the "church" on the earth is separated from Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Up-to-Date Presentation of the God-Ordained Way and the Signs Concerning the Coming of Christ &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
