THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2><p>Why do we call ourselves &#8220;the church in Anaheim,&#8221; &#8220;the church in Huntington Beach,&#8221; or &#8220;the church in Los Angeles&#8221;? We have been fully misunderstood concerning this matter and even charged by the speaker at Melodyland with &#8220;enormous egotism.&#8221; This is mainly due to ignorance concerning God&#8217;s revelation of the church.<p>In the heart of God in eternity past was an &#8220;eternal purpose,&#8221; and the means by which this purpose would be fulfilled is called &#8220;the church&#8221; (Eph. 3:10-11). Therefore, this name &#8220;the church&#8221; came out of the heart of God. Then the Lord Jesus gave this same title to this same marvelous entity when He spoke in Matthew 16:18, &#8220;I will build my church.&#8221; In Revelation 2 and 3, the Holy Spirit is revealed again and again as speaking to &#8220;the churches.&#8221; Furthermore, throughout the narrative of Acts and the writings of the apostles, the same unique title &#8220;the church&#8221; or &#8220;the churches&#8221; is used repeatedly. No definitive adjectives are used before this title, denoting which church. There is only one church, &#8220;the church.&#8221;<p>Although this simple title-planned by God, spoken by the Lord, addressed by the Spirit, and referred to by the apostles-has been persistently misused and abused, we still would return to the Bible to call ourselves what the Triune God and the apostles have called us, &#8220;the church.&#8221; What church? The church. This does not mean that we are the church and others are not the members of the church. Every blood-washed, regenerated child of God is part of it. They were born into it. But many are not meeting as the church, but in a divided and confused situation. To prefix &#8220;the church&#8221; with adjectives, such as Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, etc., and to meet as such is to divide the church and separate members one from another. To call it a &#8220;fellowship&#8221; or a &#8220;center&#8221; is to miss the mark. God wants His people today to forsake every divisive name and standing and to meet together with other Christians simply as the church in their locality. This is what the Bible shows us.<p>Let us consider God&#8217;s Word. In the beginning of the New Testament, in Matthew, and at the end of the New Testament, in Revelation, the Lord Jesus Himself speaks of the church. However, in Matthew it is singular (&#8220;my church&#8221;), and in Revelation it is plural (&#8220;the seven churches&#8221;). In Matthew, He is speaking of the one universal church, whereas in Revelation He is speaking of the local churches. The one universal church must have an expression, and it is expressed practically in many localities as the local churches. &#8220;Local churches&#8221; is not their title, but merely a description of their nature.<p>Now notice the passage in Revelation 1:11. The Lord said, &#8220;What you see write in a book and send it to the seven churches.&#8221; Then He immediately proceeded to mention seven cities: &#8220;To Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.&#8221; The Lord, as always, spoke very precisely and meaningfully. He said seven churches, and then mentioned seven cities, indicating that the city is equivalent to the church, or, in other words, the city is the boundary, the jurisdiction, of a local church. Nothing could be more clear.<p>This principle is repeated by the apostles in many instances in the Epistles and the Acts, and it is never violated. The Scripture says, &#8220;The church which was at Jerusalem&#8221; (Acts 8:1), never, &#8220;The churches which were at Jerusalem.&#8221; It says, &#8220;The church that was at Antioch&#8221; (Acts 13:1), never, &#8220;The churches that were at Antioch.&#8221; If there was one city, there was only one church. When the Scripture refers to a district, with many cities, it consistently refers to the churches (plural) in that district: e.g., &#8220;the churches in Judea&#8221; (Gal. 1:22), the churches of Syria and Cilicia (Acts 15:41), &#8220;the churches of Asia&#8221; (1 Cor. 16:19), and so forth. In one district there may be many churches, but in one city there can only be one church.<p>The saved ones are the called-out ones, but since they are still living among men, the Lord gathers them in the place where they are living. If you are living in Dallas, you must simply meet together with the other saved ones as the church in Dallas. If you are living in Seattle, you must simply meet with the other Christians as the church in Seattle. How simple and pure this arrangement is! There is no room for human opinion or human choice. The church that is built in Dallas is just the one church; the church that is built in any place is the same church, for the church is one in the whole universe. There is no difference in nature, but only in geography. If all God&#8217;s people could see this, there would be no divisions. Only geography is unavoidable. All other distinctions separating Christians are absolutely unnecessary and violate the unity of the church. Herein we find the wisdom of God. In one locality after another, in order to keep the unity of the church, God establishes only one church.<p>As further proof, consider Acts 14:23: &#8220;And having chosen them elders in each church...&#8221; Now compare this with Titus 1:5: &#8220;And establish elders in each city.&#8221; In Acts Paul says &#8220;elders in each church,&#8221; and in Titus he says &#8220;elders in each city.&#8221; These verses prove that the elders of a city are the elders of a church. They also prove that the boundary of the church is just the boundary of the city. If the church is smaller than the city or greater than the city, it is not a proper local church as delineated by the Scriptures.<p>Our standard must be the Word of God. We must be true to the light God has given, or our conscience will give us no rest. The proper standing for all genuine Christians as the one church in each locality is clearly set forth in God&#8217;s Word. There is no need to search for it, we only need to return to it. That is what we have done, and we are being condemned for it. But we strongly reject all charges of being divisive. We are simply standing on the ground where all Christians are one. This is not Witness Lee&#8217;s church. It does not belong to him, and he has never attempted to take it over. To make this charge manifests an utter ignorance of the facts.<p>The confusion found in Christianity today is mainly due to this matter. Christians are meeting together, perhaps ignorantly and unconsciously, on the wrong standing, a divisive standing, according to their own taste and choice. The sects and denominations of today could no longer exist if all would come together to express the one church in each city according to the Scriptures. Therefore, anyone who insists on keeping the denominations is divisive. In the light of this truth, the local churches are not dividing the Body of Christ, as we have been charged. The responsibility of division lies upon the denominations, fellowships, centers, and other groups who do not care for the practical unity of the Body in their locality. If a woman is married to Mr. Jones and yet insists on calling herself Mrs. Smith, it proves there is a serious problem. Such a practice would be extremely objectionable and even intolerable to Mr. Jones. The wife, if she would be proper, must return to her standing as Mrs. Jones and commence calling herself Mrs. Jones. The application to today&#8216;s situation is clear.<p>May the Lord lead many more of His children into the practical expression of the unity of His church.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
