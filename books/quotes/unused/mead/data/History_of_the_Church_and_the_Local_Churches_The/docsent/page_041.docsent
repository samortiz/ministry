   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Learning to Depend on the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Live by the Resurrection Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>through Ill Health</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Nee's sufferings also came from his ill health.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He contracted tuberculosis in 1924, and by 1929 he was dying from this disease.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, he received a word from Lord, he stood on that word, and he was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His testimony of this is in Watchman Nee's Testimony, pages 30-38.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later, he had stomach troubles, and then he had heart disease.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not get married until 1934, and his ministry began about 1923.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eleven years of his ministry passed, and he did not have a wife to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He lived as a single man until 1934, so he really suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He always told me beginning in 1934 that he could die at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times while he was speaking, he had to lean on the stand because he was in so much pain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He told us that many times, while he was speaking, he would break out in a cold sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Also, before he went to conference meetings, there were many times that he had to lay on the bed until the time came for him to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After he spoke, he immediately went back home to lie down.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that eventually in 1972 he died of his heart disease while he was in the communists' prison.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We received definite information from a very close relative of his who was always taking care of him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He lived with heart disease for close to forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was suffering all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through his poverty, he learned the lesson of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He knew how to be a "lily" Matt 6:28 , living on this earth in total dependence upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He lived on this earth by faith in God, without trusting in any human help.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, because of his ill health, he had to learn to depend on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He learned to live by the resurrection life to meet his physical need.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many times he ministered, not by his physical strength or energy, but by the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I saw this while he was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through all his sufferings, he learned some real lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I cannot estimate the tremendous help we received from these lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I personally received great help from his experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spiritual Lessons Learned</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>through Persecution from Christianity</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In addition to his poverty and bad health, Brother Nee also suffered all kinds of persecution from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the third category of his sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would like to relate a little history so that we can see the background of Brother Nee's sufferings in this category.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Boxer Rebellion in China was in 1900.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was an attempt by some to drive foreigners out of China and to force Christians, both native and foreign, to renounce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Afterward, there was a revolution in China, which succeeded in 1911.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After 1911, there was no persecution of Christianity throughout all of China.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, many people began to have a positive attitude toward Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we have seen, Brother Nee was saved in 1920.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That was during a time when Christianity had become prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During that time the Lord was moving in the universities, and many young people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, there was not any persecution or opposition from the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The persecution which Brother Nee suffered came almost entirely from Christianity.</S>
