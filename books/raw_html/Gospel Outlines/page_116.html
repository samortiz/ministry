<h1 class="title">THE GOOD SHEPHERD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 10:10-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Men are the sheep of the Lord
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Men are created by the Lord and are the Lord&rsquo;s.</li>
	<li>Men are also watched over and shepherded by the Lord.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord is the good shepherd
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord looks after us and shepherds us. This shows that He is a good shepherd.</li>
	<li>His shepherding us not only provides us with the ordinary supply, but also with His life. Ordinary shepherds give something outside of themselves to supply the sheep. The Lord, as a shepherd, not only supplies us with something outside of Himself, but also with His life. His life is His own self, so He supplies us with His own self.</li>
	<li>Since the Lord wanted us to have His life, He had to give up His life for us. He is the good shepherd who gives His life for the sheep.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How do we receive the Lord&rsquo;s shepherding?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must confess that we are out from Him and of Him.</li>
	<li>We must confess that we have not obtained the Lord&rsquo;s life, and have not had any life relationship with Him.</li>
	<li>We must receive the Lord as our life.</li>
	<li>We must follow the inner sense of life that the Lord gives us.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
