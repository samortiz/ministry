The Law of the Spirit of Life</H2><P>Fourth, there is the law of the Spirit of life. This law comes into us at the time we believe in the Lord. With which part do we receive the Lord? We receive Him with our spirit. Hence, the law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit. With every saved person, there is the law of good, the law of evil, and the law of life. The law of good is in the soul, and the law of evil is in the body, whereas the law of life is in the spirit. All the three parts of man, the spirit, the soul, and the body, have their own laws.</P><P>Suppose a brother becomes angry with his wife in the evening, and he begins to beat her. This is the operation of the law of evil in the body. The next morning his reason takes over, and he changes his attitude, and he becomes polite to his wife. This is the operation of the law of reason in his soul. In the afternoon when he fellowships with God and is filled with Him, he begins to bear a spiritual taste, and this is the operation of the law of the Spirit of life. The law of good in the soul desires to obey the law of God and to please Him. But the law of evil in the body frustrates it and causes a person to sin and to rebel against God's law, and to come under judgment. Thanks be to God. Here is the law of the Spirit of life to be man's salvation. It delivers man from the law of evil and good, and it causes man to transcend, to rise above good to satisfy God's law and to more than conquer all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED FOR A CHRISTIAN TO LIVE BY<br>THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</H2><P>Today, we should not be a Christian according to the first, second, or third law. Rather, we should be a Christian according to the fourth law. If someone on the street hits you, why would you not hit him back? Some say that it is because the Bible tells us not to do so. If you say this, you are acting according to the first law. When a wife submits to her husband, and children submit to their parents, these submissions may be something according to the first law. To be a Christian in this way is wrong.</P><P>Perhaps some would say that they want to be a good man and that they have made up their mind to be good. This is to live according to the second law. Then there are those who say that if others hit them, they would surely retaliate, and they would retaliate in a stronger way than they were hit. This is to fall into the third law, the law of evil in the body. It is wrong to live according to the first, the second, or the third law. If I do not retaliate, it should be because my spirit feels not to retaliate, and because to retaliate would make me feel uncomfortable and cause my spirit to protest. If a wife submits to her husband, it should be because her spirit is telling her to submit. If we do this, we are living according to the fourth law. If we live according to the fourth law, we will be able to say, "Hallelujah!" Only by being this kind of Christian will we have peace, and only then will we be at ease.</P><P>In Shanghai someone asked me once, "Why can't I smoke?" I said, "If you can smoke in peace, go ahead and smoke more." If you can hit your wife in peace, and if by hitting her, you can be brought to God, go ahead and hit her some more. On the other hand, if by loving your wife you can gain the peace and can bring God into you, you should go ahead and love her more. If your love does not bring you peace, this kind of love is appalling. We should be fellowshipping with the Lord within us all the time. If we have peace to do something, we should go ahead and do it. If we do not have the peace, we should not do it. We should be a comfortable, peaceful, happy, and joyful Christian. We should not deceive ourselves or others. Only such Christians will meet God, and only they will see the blessing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PRAYER</H2><P>Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi prayed: May the Lord lead men to God through His servant's words. May the words open man's understanding and enlighten man's inner being, so that the brothers and sisters would have a pure heart toward the Lord and would not become Christians who live according to morality or by resolutions, but would become Christians who live out their life in a spontaneous way. Grant Your children's conscience, spirit, and intuition to have sensitive responses. Amen.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
