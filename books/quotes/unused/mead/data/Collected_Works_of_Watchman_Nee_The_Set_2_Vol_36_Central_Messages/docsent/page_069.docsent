   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Dealing with Unrighteous Money</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The thing that touches us the most is money.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, we must first learn righteousness in the way we deal with money.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot spend other people's money, much less can we steal money from others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot turn other people's money into our own by improper means.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Turning what is not ours into something that is ours through any improper means or in any subconscious way is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there are such things, we have to deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot borrow something from others and never return it to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the beginning of our Christian life, we should do our best to clear up any financial entanglements with others; we must not be loose in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God has shown you that you owe others anything, that you have stolen from others, or that you have extorted from others, you have to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have to deal with any evasion or omission in tax that is due the government.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must deal with the matter of money very seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have to deal with everything in the past that the Lord puts His finger on, and you have to do your best to preserve yourself in this matter in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are loose in this matter, you will be loose in every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One cannot be loose or foolish about money.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you cannot financially afford to repay everything all at once, you must first confess to others what you owe, and then do your best to make restitution later.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Repay if you can, but if you cannot repay now, confess first and then repay later.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Dealing with Material Things That We Owe Others</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Other than money, we have to deal with other material things that we owe to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not have the habit of coveting others' possessions, and we should never borrow something from others without returning it to them promptly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many times we have the bad habit of being careful with our own things and careless with the things of others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to learn to be conscientious with others' possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We still have some borrowed items that should be returned to the owner.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some borrowed items have been lost; we should purchase similar items and return them to the owner or pay back the equivalent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not borrow some items from others anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people have failed in these material things, and we must be extremely careful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In all these matters we have to express God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot be loose or careless in handling material things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Dealing with Covetousness</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to deal thoroughly with material things, and we also need to deal with the greed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Covetousness is a very bad habit as well as an inclination.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to learn to benefit others, to care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not hope to gain from or take advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must learn not to profit at the expense of others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Doing so is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Consider the example of rickshaw fares.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of my friends realize that there are certain days that are slow days for the rickshaw drivers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The routes that they want to take are often unfamiliar to the rickshaw drivers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result, they bargain for a lower fare.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we care for righteousness, should we try to take advantage of these circumstances?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Outwardly speaking, it is not wrong for us to pay as we have agreed to be charged.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But according to the Christian standard, we should pay the rickshaw driver a little more than what is required.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only is robbing others unrighteous; greediness and taking advantage of others are also unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even when others approve of what we do, we are often still unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Others may approve of us and agree to take up the loss because they have no choice, but a Christian should not do anything like this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our business transactions, we should not calculate how much we can take advantage of others, but how much is a fair price.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Righteousness will bring us to the point that we satisfy our Christian conscience within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not what others say, but whether our inner being agrees or disagrees.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Dealing with the Unrighteous</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Infringement upon Others' Rights</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Not only can we be unrighteous in material things, but we can be unrighteous with respect to the rights of others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, there are set times for work and rest in public places.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When it is time to rest, others have the right to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we shout and yell while others are resting, we are disturbing their rest and are being unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Another example of infringing upon the rights of others is browsing over their documents.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is also unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we travel, we have to follow the proper order in boarding and unboarding buses.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are at the end of a line and try to cut into the line, we are infringing upon the rights of others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should be sensitive concerning things of this nature, and we must deal with them; otherwise, we are not being righteous.</S>
