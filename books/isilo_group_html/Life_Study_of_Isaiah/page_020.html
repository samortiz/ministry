All the Lofty Mountains and All the Lifted-up Hills</H2><P>God also judges all the lofty mountains and all the lifted-up hills (v. 14). In figure and in typology, these mountains and hills signify countries, nations, and kingdoms.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Every High Tower and Every Fortified Wall</H2><P>Verse 15 speaks of God's judgment on every high tower and every fortified wall.
