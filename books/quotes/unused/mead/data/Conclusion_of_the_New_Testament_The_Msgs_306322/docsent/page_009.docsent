   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE THREE HUNDRED EIGHT EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE EPISTLES 14 23.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Content of the Apostle s Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ as the content of the apostle s ministry is an aspect of the enjoyment of Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 2:1-5 reveals that Christ who is our portion for our enjoyment is the content of the apostle s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostle s ministry consists of not only Christ as the mystery of God but also the crucified Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the apostle s ministry, Christ is the mystery of God ministered to us, and Jesus Christ is the crucified One.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a Christ is ministered not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that is, the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In contrast to many so-called ministries today that scarcely know the mystery of God, the apostle s ministry was the New Testament ministry, a ministry that ministers the mystery of God concerning Christ and the crucified Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the eyes of human beings, the crucifixion of Christ is foolishness, but in God s eternal economy, it is something powerful, carried out in order to fulfill God s mystery, His eternal purpose Eph 3:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, Paul s proclamation was in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we properly minister the mystery of God concerning Christ, we will have impact.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The New Testament ministry that ministers the mystery of God concerning Christ is a powerful ministry, a ministry that is demonstrated by the living Spirit and the divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>a. The Mystery of God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1 Corinthians 2:1 Paul says, I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What the apostle testified was the mystery of God, which is Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the expression of Christ Rom 16:25-26; Col 1:26-27; 2:2; 4:3; Eph 3:4-6, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today many preach about Christ and testify of Him, but most of those who preach Christ do not care for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, in the New Testament, the full mystery of God includes Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is God s mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Himself God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is real, living, and almighty; however, He is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because no one has ever seen God, He is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This mysterious God is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is not only God; He is also God embodied, God defined, God explained, and God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, Christ is God made visible John 14:9 ; Christ, God expressed, is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As believers, we have Christ dwelling in us, but this Christ whom we have is a mystery Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Ephesians 3:4 Paul thus uses the expression themystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although Christ lives in us, worldly people do not realize that He is in us; to them, this is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But though Christ is mysterious, the church is the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the Body of Christ, the church is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we see the church, we see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we come into the church, we come into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we contact the church, we contact Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is truly the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Paul came to Corinth, he preached concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That is, Paul presented the complete mystery of God: Christ, the Head, and the church, the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Crucified Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1 Corinthians 2:2 Paul continues, I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The crucified Christ is the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this he did not determine to know anything but the all-inclusive Christ, and this One crucified, when he was going to minister the word of the testimony of God to the excellent-speech-exalting and wisdom-worshipping Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What a determination!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It should be a pattern to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The expression this One crucified speaks of the example of the Lord s living, action, work, and way, indicating His humiliation and abasement.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to overturn the pride of the Greeks in their elevated wisdom, Paul did not refer here to the Lord s resurrection in glory Luke 24:26 and His ascension in exaltation Acts 2:33, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to belittle their highly esteemed knowledge and point them to the crucified Christ, Paul reminded the Corinthians that the Christ he preached was One who had been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He proclaimed not an honored, exalted, and glorified Christ, but a Christ who had been despised, rejected, and even crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that after receiving Christ, we should no longer live in a way to exalt ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, we should live a crucified life, even live the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should be willing to give the impression that we do not know anything other than the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should learn to determine not to know anything among the saints except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we determine not to know anything except Christ, there will not be any problems or divisions among us.</S>
