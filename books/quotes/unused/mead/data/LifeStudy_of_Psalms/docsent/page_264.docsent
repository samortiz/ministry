   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. PSALMS BOOK 4 UNVEILING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SAINTS' DEEPER EXPERIENCE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND GOD'S RECOVERY OF HIS TITLE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AND RIGHT OVER THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalms Book 4 unveils the saints' deeper experience of God in the identification with Christ and God's recovery of His title and right over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that our experience of dwelling in God paves the way for Christ to come to posses the earth that God may recover His title and right over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Title refers to ownership, and right refers to all God's rights over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the saints' deeper experience of God, God has no way to recover this title and right.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that if we drink Christ, eat Christ, and breathe Christ without taking Christ as our habitation, God has no way to recover the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This thought is found in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 14:2 the Lord Jesus said, "In My Father's house are many abodes...I go to prepare a place for you."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These abodes are not rooms in a heavenly mansion, as commonly supposed, but places in the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 15:4 the Lord went on to say, "Abide in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This reveals that Christ is not only the way to the house He is the house itself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To abide in Christ is to dwell in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By our dwelling in Him Christ has a way to recover the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A. Psalms Book 1 Unveiling Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>and Books 2 and 3 Unveiling Christ</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>with the House and the City of God</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Psalms Book 1 unveils Christ, and Books 2 and 3 unveil Christ with the house and the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Books 2 and 3 Ending with the Extension</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>of God's Kingdom to the Whole Earth</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both Books 2 and 3 end with the extension of God's kingdom to the whole earth Psa 72:8, 11, 19; 89:25, 27 .</S>
