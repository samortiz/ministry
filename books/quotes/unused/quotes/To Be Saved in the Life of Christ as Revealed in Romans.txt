The first section is God's redemption through the death of Christ, and the second is God's saving in the life of Christ
In this book we will see only the main significance of the second section of Romans, that is, how Christ saves us in His divine life
Many of us may have realized that God has given us His Son, His eternal life, and the Holy Spirit as the precious gifts
He presents the righteousness of God as the base of our faith and shows that this righteousness of God is based upon God Himself
His salvation has the solid foundation of His righteousness, and upon this foundation of righteousness, we are saved
In this testing, examination, and judgment, He has already won the victory, and no one is able to defy God in His righteousness
God can justify us based upon Christs redemption because all of His righteous requirements have been fulfilled by Christs death on the cross
Because of Christ's redemption, He has a strong base according to His righteousness to justify us and to declare that we are approved by Him
The justification God has given us is based upon the fulfillment of His righteous requirements by Christ's all-inclusive death
Because we have received the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness, we can reign in life
We have received a life which not only gives us the ability to be spiritual, heavenly, and divine, but also gives us the ability to reign
To reign in life is to reign over such things as sin, the world, Satan, the natural man, the self, and individualism
As long as we live in our natural man, we would not agree with our wife, our husband, our parents, or the other members of our family
When we behave ourselves in Christ, in the status and position of a saint, we are nice and agreeable with everybody in nearly everything
When we are outside of Christ, especially when we lose our temper, we forget our position and status as saints
We have received the abundance of grace and the abundance of the gift of righteousness in order to reign in life
When there is a time of turmoil or rebellion in the church life, we should just tell the turmoil or rebellion that we do not agree with it
When we have the serious consideration that we are submissive to the Lord who is our Master, we feel the abundance of grace within us
To the rebellious ones, it is a kind of ruling, but to the submissive ones, it is the enjoyment of the abundance of grace
Rather, you should stay in the grace of the redeeming Christ and in the gift of righteousness of the justifying God
Sanctification in the New Testament has two aspects: positional sanctification and dispositional sanctification
Before we believed, the Holy Spirit came to us to sanctify us, to separate us from sin and the world before our repentance
After we repented and believed, we were sanctified positionally with a view to the dispositional sanctification
As the believers continue to grow unto maturity, those who labor on the believers present them full-grown in Christ
We also need dispositional sanctification because our disposition has been soaked with the element of the world
The only thing that can save us from the contamination of the world is the dispositional sanctification by the indwelling Spirit
God sanctifies only the redeemed and justified ones; therefore, first we must be redeemed and justified in order to be righteous
We are dispositionally sanctified through our cooperation by presenting our members as slaves to righteousness
Because many items within the department stores are sinful and worldly, window-shopping is actually not righteous
As we walk through the department stores, many items attract us and cause us to present our eyes to these unrighteous things
He not only tells us to present ourselves as a whole, but also tells us to present every member of our body to righteousness
To present ourselves and our members to righteousness means to present ourselves and our members to Christ as righteousness
These three laws are three persons: the law of sin and death is Satan, the law of good is man, and the law of the Spirit of life is God
In this consummated Spirit there is God, man, human living, the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the ascension of Christ
The processed Triune God, who is now the consummated Spirit, the compound Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, has entered into us as a law
Based upon his understanding of the natural laws, he spoke in Romans 7 and 8 about three laws, all of which are operating within us
If we do not eat, the law of digestion cannot work, because the requirement for its operation has not been fulfilled
Another crucial point of God's saving in the life of Christ is the dispensing of the processed Triune God into our tripartite being
The Triune God dispenses Himself into our spirit by the Spirit's regenerating of our spirit with Christ as life to make our spirit life
From our spirit the dispensing God spreads His dispensing into our mind, the leading part of our soul, to make our soul life
The hair styles and styles in dress of people today are also according to the present age, the modern style, of the world
Inwardly, we are saved from our disposition, and outwardly, we are saved from a living which is conformed to the present age of the world
Our being saved from the living that is conformed to the present age is through our cooperation by setting our mind on the spirit
If we do not reject this dispensing, we will immediately receive the dispensing of this divine element into our being
Through the dispensing of the food into us, nourishment and sustaining strength are absorbed into our cells and fibers
The only couple in the universe that is able to be genuinely one is Christ and the transformed and glorified church
There are separations upon separations, divisions upon divisions, denominations upon denominations, groups upon groups
On some occasions the team members may exercise to be polite to one another, not wanting to offend one another
At other times the team members may simply express their feeling, disregarding the feeling of the other team members
In September of 1939 Brother Nee held a conference in Shanghai after he had returned from his visit to England
Brother Nee spoke message after message, week after week, concerning the Body, from 1939 until the middle of 1942
Without the practice of the oneness, which is the one accord, the oneness might simply be a kind of thought or theory
In Acts the most prevailing thing among the disciples was neither their prayer nor the outpouring of the Spirit
When not going along with others and not being one with others becomes a principle or philosophy, that is individualism
Conversely, if we are built up in the Body of Christ, we will be delivered from the individualism of our natural life
Many of these saints agree with the new way, but there is still very little actual practice of the new way among them
If the saints would present themselves and go along with one another, immediately there would be the practice of the new way
To visit people requires that we present our bodies to the Lord as a sacrifice and that we go along with others
We are built up in the Body of Christ through our cooperation by not thinking more highly of ourselves than what we are
For this reason, we see very little of the building up of the Body of Christ and very little actual practice of the new way
In the living of the church life in a locality, our living is local, but our fellowship should be both local and universal
In the churches, we must exercise to have fellowship with Taipei, London, New York, Zurich, and all the churches around the globe
In the living of the church life in a locality, we must receive all the believers according to God's receiving
We must be able to receive the genuine believers of all kinds: Pentecostal, fundamental, Seventh-Day Adventists, and all others
When we are about to judge another Christian we must realize that we ourselves have many shortcomings and weak points that need to be judged
The Lord has charged us with this more than strongly in John 13:34-35 and 15:12 and 17; the apostles also repeated the Lord's charge to us
Romans 14:17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
The church life which is God's kingdom life today is a matter of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit
The living of the church life in a locality also involves turning away from those who make divisions and causes of falling
Those involved in the present rebellion are attempting to proselytize the saints, to make them leave the recovery
The living of the church life in a locality also includes the keeping of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ universally
We are not only standing on the unique ground of oneness locally but also keeping the fellowship with all the churches around the globe
To go to another place in this way is still something of division, making themselves a local sect instead of a local church
When the enemy Satan is crushed under our feet in the church life, we enjoy Christ as our grace, our life supply
When we live a proper church life and Satan is crushed under our feet, we remain in God as peace and enjoy Christ as grace
He is the mysterious God and He is invisible, but He has a desire, as His good pleasure, to have Himself expressed through man
Christ was the only begotten Son of God from eternity past until the time that He was resurrected in His incarnated and crucified body
The expression of Christ as the firstborn Son of God requires the death of the natural life and the power of resurrection in the divine life
Our environment and our circumstances work together with the divine life within us for our conformation to the image of Christ
In this way he may blame God for his being in a poor condition because of the 'poor' wife the Lord has given him
The next verse, verse 30, also unveils to us that God calls, justifies, and will glorify His predestinated people
The Holy Spirit seals us with the divine ink, and the Spirit Himself as the ink carries out a continuous inking within us
That day has not yet come, but today we have the indwelling Spirit as the firstfruit, the foretaste, of God as our portion
The Spirit seals us unto the day of redemption , unto the redemption of the acquired possession , unto the redemption of our body
In this sense, the redemption of our body will not be something which happens in a sudden way, as if by accident
In this way, the book of Romans comprises all the items of God's redemption and God's saving in His full salvation
