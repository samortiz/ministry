   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. IN ESTABLISHING NOT OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT GOD S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We reign in life in establishing not our own righteousness but God s righteousness Rom 9:14 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Israelites, being ignorant of God s righteousness, seek to establish their own righteousness by trying to keep the law, and have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is an insult to God, and it causes them to miss the way of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have believed in Christ and have therefore received God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is to establish God s righteousness, which is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. Being Exceptionally Strengthened</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>in Establishing Not Our Own Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>but God s Righteousness in Our Reigning with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are exceptionally strengthened in establishing not our own righteousness but God s righteousness in our reigning with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To strengthen is to emphasize; this is with regard to the contents.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our work in the Lord s recovery what we strongly emphasize is that grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is representative of our speaking in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that you all can be like tape recorders and have this word deeply impressed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then when you go out to contact others, you can spontaneously speak, and only speak, this word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May such tape recorders increase more and more until no other speaking can be heard on the whole earth except this: Grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. Being Exceptionally Radiant</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>in Establishing Not Our Own Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>but God s Righteousness in Our Reigning with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are exceptionally radiant in establishing not our own righteousness but God s righteousness in our reigning with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be radiant refers to the outward expression; it is regarding the result.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our work in the Lord s recovery we do not boast in anything except grace as the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We consider this as our radiance, our boast.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be strengthened is something inward; to be radiant is something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today the Lord has given these truths to us that we may strengthen them in their contents inwardly and radiate them in their reality outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some may ask, Does this mean that among us we should not teach anything else?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a matter of whether or not to teach other things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, it is that we do not have any spare time to teach anything other than the central revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past we received Brother Nee s leading to meet according to 1 Corinthians 14 not to have one man speaking and all the rest listening, but to have everyone prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From 1933 Brother Nee began to strongly promote this practice, but it was unsuccessful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not until the recent years when we restudied 1 Corinthians 14 that we discovered that the Lord s intention is not merely to have all the members taking turns to speak but to have all the members blended together as one Body to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the past we did not dare to speak in the meetings, because we did not know what to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But now the whole situation has been changed; everyone is glad to prophesy and everyone speaks concerning the unique central revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is what we particularly emphasize and boast of.</S>
