   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Baptism Being for the Washing Away of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us consider the case of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ananias came to Paul and said to him, "Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name" Acts 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul was the foremost and greatest teacher, prophet, and apostle of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Was there a little error in his experience?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes we preach the right doctrines but have the wrong experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What would happen when we gave our testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What would happen if others did the same thing we do?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The testimony of a teacher is very important because it may mislead others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Could it be that the experience of the foremost teacher of Christianity was wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"And now, why do you delay?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please take note of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It says that baptism can wash away one's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Catholics quote this verse and regard it as a personal matter before God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The error of Catholicism lies in saying, "If you are baptized, your sins will be washed away."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, they claim that a death-bed baptism can wash away sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not realize that the significance of this matter is not before God but before the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Formerly, Paul was a man in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After he had believed in the Lord Jesus and had seen Him, he needed to rise up and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The moment he was baptized, his sins were washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The moment he severed his relationship with the world, his sins were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you are a Christian secretly and are not baptized, the world may still consider you as one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may say that you are saved, but the world will not admit it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may say that you have believed in the Lord Jesus, but they will say that they have not seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once you get into the water, they will see it; they will know that you have believed in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, why should a person be so foolish as to get into the water?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The moment you are baptized, you are freed from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Water baptism is a severance of one's relationship with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a person believes in his heart but does not have any outward gesture, the world will still consider him to be part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For instance, in Kuling of Fukien there is a strong tradition of idol worship every fall; everyone is required to donate some money.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a person merely says that he has believed in the Lord, others will not believe him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the moment he is baptized, they will know that he is no longer one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, baptism is the best way to free oneself from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you want to be freed from the world, you must be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must tell the world, "My relationship with you is over."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By doing this, you come out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Baptism is an open testimony, and we should not be afraid to let others witness it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Unbelievers can also be present during our baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Recently, when we baptized some people in Foochow, a brother said, "We do not like to conduct the baptism meeting in such a messy way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There were too many spectators."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If this is the case, John the Baptist would have to learn from this brother because John conducted baptisms that were not that orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even the baptisms of the three thousand on the day of Pentecost were not that orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The issue is not whether a meeting is orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of course, it is not good to be disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But all the brothers and sisters should know what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we baptize someone, we should let the whole world witness what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. Baptism Leading to Salvation through Water</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Scripture is consistent in its principles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First Peter 3:20 says, "In the days of Noah...a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This verse shows us again that baptism leads to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord Jesus said, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the day of Pentecost, Peter said, "Be baptized...for the forgiveness of your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul's action shows us that when a person is baptized, his sins are washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They are not just forgiven, but washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is because our sins are washed away when we sever our relationship with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here, the word in 1 Peter also shows us that we are saved through water.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, baptism leads to salvation through water.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who cannot pass the test of water are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A person who cannot pass through water drowns.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During Noah's time, everyone was baptized, but only eight souls came out.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the people were baptized and immersed in the water, but only eight souls emerged from it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In other words, the water became the water of death to some, but to others it was the water of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Others go into the water and remain there, but we pass through the water and emerge from it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is something positive in Peter's word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the flood came, everyone drowned.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Only the eight souls in the ark, whom the water could not overcome, emerged from it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>While the rest perished, these eight souls were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today the whole world is under the wrath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For one to be baptized today means that he goes through God's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But he does not only go through it; he comes out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His emergence from it shows that he is one who has come out.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Baptism is being immersed on one side and emerging out of water on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Baptism means passing through and emerging from the water.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You must emphasize the aspect of "emergence."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Everyone went into the water, but only the eight souls came out.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today we are saved through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When I am baptized, I do not go into the water and remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, I enter into the water and emerge from it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you have never believed in the Lord Jesus, your baptism will not result in an emergence.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Today my going into the water and coming out of it means that I am different from you.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I can come out from the world through the water.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I testify to others that I am different from the world.</S>
