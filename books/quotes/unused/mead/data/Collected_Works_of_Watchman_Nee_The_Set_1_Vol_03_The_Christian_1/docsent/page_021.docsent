   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As the earth came out from the waters, so the spirit is resurrected from within the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The waters were not eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The flesh does not become the spirit, nor is it eradicated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The waters were gathered into one place and could not go over their boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise the flesh is still here, yet the Lord's death and resurrection have given us authority to restrict it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The flesh is incurable and has been rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet whoever has died and has been raised together with the Lord is "not in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rom 8:9</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen the work on the first half of the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we come to the second half.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have been resurrected; now it is a matter of bringing forth fruit Gen 1:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Resurrection and the bringing forth of fruit are directly connected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God" Rom 7:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"And having been freed from sin, you were enslaved to righteousness" Rom 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God called the dry land "Earth."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The root of this word in the original text is "broken."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all know that rich soil must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If it is not broken, it cannot be fertile.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more the earth's soil is crushed to powder, the better the harvest will be.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only in this way can the soil supply nourishment to planted seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the seawater retreats in our experience, the land may still be hard; it can still resist the hand of the sower.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the power of the flesh is lost, the natural soul-life still considers itself a "good self," boasts of its natural abilities and virtues, and refuses to surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The broken soul-life of a believer is rich soil in the heavenly Father's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God does not require ability, but inability, of us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He does not require strength, but weakness, of us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He does not require us to be filled up but to be emptied.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He does not want us to resist but to surrender.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is almighty and He has all the might.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His power is manifested in weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's seed flourishes the most in a broken field.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Fruit-bearing does not come through the preservation of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, it comes by its breaking, its humbling, and its weakness; it comes by our reliance on God which allows His hand to work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our own ability is always an obstacle to the manifestation of God's ability.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not hate our soul-life, our natural life, our ability, our talent, our wisdom, and our virtues, we cannot produce much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we drive out the natural life and ability inherited from our flesh the earth that emerged from the waters and accept God's hand with a broken heart, we can obtain God's fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We often think that this sinful, filthy flesh should be annihilated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we should realize that to bring forth fruit, it is important to forsake our good, just, honest, and righteous soul the self .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may be content with our field, but God thinks that the field must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We value ourselves too much!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Little do we realize that our self has been infected by Adam's sin, and that it is still weak and powerless!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All our good resolutions and intentions are like overnight flowers and soap bubbles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are weak, empty, and destitute, submitting as clay to the potter's hand, the life of Christ will live within us, and His power will be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we know the meaning of the cross and the reality of resurrection, the more we will know the true meaning of the breaking of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This earth is not irrigated by seawater; its productivity is not cultivated by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The mist Gen 2:6 is its moistening agent; the Holy Spirit cares for it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In bearing fruit in the truth, all the ordinances of the flesh are "of none effect."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Limiting its boundary and naming its name shows that the flesh is not a help to the new creation, and that it should be condemned and regarded as incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is also a progression in the fruit brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First there was grass, then herbs, and then the fruit trees.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Fruit is not primarily for its own use, but for the Lord's. "Bear fruit to God" Rom 7:4 . Every kind of fruit is able to continue its own kind, "whose seed was in itself, after his kind." The seed is within the fruit, after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, only love can beget love, only joy can beget joy, and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we want love, then we must show love.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we want joy, then we must show joy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The fruit that spends much time under the sun's heat is the ripest and most suitable for the master's appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The ripest fruit has the ripest seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What a man reaps is according to what he sows.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>VII."And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so" Gen 1:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The work on this day is quite different from the previous days.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The work on the earth has moved to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The work on this day is a work in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the ascension of Christ with His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After resurrection the next event in sequence is ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Ascension is the crucial truth after resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without ascension, our "new creation" is not a complete work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We receive ascension, like all the other truths such as crucifixion and resurrection, at the moment we believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At that very moment God puts us in the position of ascension even though we have not yet had the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The experience of ascension follows the experience of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we are truly resurrected with the Lord and united with His resurrection life, we will spontaneously bear fruit on this earth, and our spiritual life will ascend to the heavenlies.</S>
