	 <h2 class="head3">Three Crucial Points</h2>
<p>We must pay attention to three crucial points. First, the names <em>Shulammite</em> and <em>Solomon</em> have the same root, just as <em>Christian</em> and <em>Christ</em> have the same root. <em>Solomon</em> is the masculine form of the word, and <em>Shulammite</em> is the feminine form. The meaning of the root is peace. This means that in resurrection the church has the peace of Christ and is peace.</p>
<p>Second, Psalm 45 shows that Solomon is the experience and beauty of the Shulammite. The experience and beauty of the Shulammite are Solomon himself. Likewise, the experience and the beauty of the church are Christ. All that the church has passed through over the past two thousand years and the beauty of the church are of the Christ of resurrection, typified by the gold covering the Shulammite, her garment of woven work inwrought with gold, and her embroidered clothing (vv. 13-14).</p>
<p>Third, there is a complete union and full satisfaction between the Shulammite and Solomon, and in this satisfaction there is rest. Although the type of Eve shows her union and satisfaction with Adam and although the type of Rebekah shows her union with Isaac and Isaac&rsquo;s being comforted, these are not the main points of these two types. In the type of the Shulammite, however, the main point is the union and satisfaction between her and Solomon. At the end of Song of Songs, the Shulammite and Solomon have reached complete harmony with full satisfaction and endless rest without any distraction or interruption; this typifies the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The union and satisfaction between the Shulammite and Solomon typify the complete union and full satisfaction that exist between Christ and the church. In this satisfaction, Christ and the church are living a life of satisfaction and peace in endless rest. Rest and satisfaction are characteristics of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A clear picture of the church can be seen by looking at the various aspects related to the seven women who serve as types of the church in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>First, as seen in the type of Eve, the church comes out of Christ and is born of Christ, having Christ&rsquo;s nature and being one with Christ.</p>
<p>Second, as seen in the type of Rebekah, God sent the Holy Spirit to the earth after Christ&rsquo;s ascension, to the place of the Lord&rsquo;s kinsmen according to His humanity, and the Holy Spirit called out a group of people to be Christ&rsquo;s counterpart, the church. At the end of this age, close to the evening, Christ will come out of His tabernacle, His dwelling place, and go to the field, the earth, to meet the church who has been led to Him by the Holy Spirit, and He will join with the church as one for their mutual satisfaction.</p>
<p>Third, as seen in the type of Asenath, the church was obtained in the world by Christ. When Christ was forsaken by men, He became the Savior of men; when He was in the world ministering life, He obtained a wife, the church.</p>
<p>Fourth, as seen in the type of Zipporah, the church was obtained by Christ in the wilderness. When Christ was forsaken by men and was wandering in the wilderness, He took a wife, the church. She is His companion in His wandering in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Fifth, as seen in the type of Ruth, the church is able to receive Christ&rsquo;s redemption and enjoy God&rsquo;s lawful blessing because her former husband, the old man, has died. Ruth&rsquo;s story speaks of redemption in detail. We were of the old man and were fallen, but because of the death of the old man, we have been delivered from our fallen position and are joined as one with Christ to inherit God&rsquo;s lawful blessing and to be fully redeemed.</p>
<p>Sixth, as seen in the type of Abigail, the church is composed of a group of people who by nature were those who forsook and opposed Christ. But one day her old nature was struck and died. She was then united with David. She passed through sufferings with David and became David&rsquo;s counterpart in warfare. In our old nature we forsook Christ, opposed Christ, and rejected Christ. But one day we were struck, and our old nature died. We were then united with Christ, and now we are following Him in the midst of all kinds of sufferings to fight for God&rsquo;s kingdom as the warring church.</p>
<p>Seventh, as seen in the type of the Shulammite, the church obtains full satisfaction and eternal rest through her union with Christ and her experience and enjoyment of Christ in His resurrection. Eventually, she becomes the New Jerusalem. The Shulammite typifies a living of complete rest and satisfaction.</p>
<p>These seven women are seven types of the church. They depict the church in a clear way: as coming out of Christ, being called out from the world, ministering together with Christ the bread of life in the world, wandering in the wilderness with Christ, receiving the redemption of Christ, warring by following Christ to fight for God&rsquo;s kingdom, and eventually becoming Christ&rsquo;s counterpart and reigning with Him in glory.</p>
<p>The sequence of these women as types of the church is truly wonderful. These seven types show, first, the producing of the church and nature of the church; second, the church coming out from the world; third, the church being in the world but not of the world (John 17:16); fourth, the church wandering in the wilderness; fifth, the church being redeemed; sixth, the church engaging in warfare; and seventh, the church reigning and being glorified. If we put these seven aspects together, we can see a complete picture of the church and have a thorough understanding of the church. We know where the church comes from, what way she should take as she is passing through the earth today, and what she eventually will be in the future. What a picture!</p>
