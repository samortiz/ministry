   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GALATIANS USING THE BACKGROUND OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO REVEAL CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians exposes religion more than any other book in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, Paul s intention in writing Galatians was not merely to expose Judaism as the present section of the evil religious world but rather to use the background of religion to reveal Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Religion comes in when there is a shortage of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Religion becomes prevailing when there is no Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are fighting against religion, yet we do not have Christ, even our fighting will eventually become a kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anything we do for God apart from Christ becomes religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ Being Revealed in Us and Living in Us</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Galatians Paul impresses us with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul writes, I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother s womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me 1:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Acts 9:3 Luke tells us that Paul outwardly saw the light on the road to Damascus, but in Galatians 1:16 Paul refers not to an outward light but to an inward revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Christ was revealed into Paul, he could say, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, Christ is revealed into us; then, Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not religion but the living Christ, who is versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The religious mentality cannot comprehend spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A certain Christian leader teaches that Christ cannot be in us because He resurrected with a physical body and ascended to the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This leader teaches that Christ is merely represented in us by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a new religion produced by the religious mentality and tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Traditional teachings concerning the Trinity, the historical Christ, and the unapproachable and infinite greatness of God convinced this leader that man cannot contain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not exercise our mind to try to understand how Christ can be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to drop the religious mentality and take the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Colossians 1:27 says, Christ in you, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 15:4 the Lord said, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Testament reveals that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We simply need to say, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being Baptized into Christ and Putting On Christ</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Galatians 3:27 Paul says, As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ not only lives within us, but He is also a realm, a sphere, into which we have entered through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, Christ lives in us, and we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should sense that we are living in Christ every day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is the sphere, the realm, and the environment in which we live and walk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If our outward environment begins to bother us, we need to be reminded by the Spirit that in reality we are living in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He lives in us, and we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, we need to put on Christ, as we would put on a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is in us and upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Inwardly, He is our life; outwardly, He is our clothing, our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ living in us and our living in Christ and putting on Christ should not be doctrine to us but our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not care for religion, forms, teachings, or doctrines but only for the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result of Christ living in us, our living in Christ, and our putting on Christ, we live Christ and magnify Christ Phil 1:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every member of the new man is Christ Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This corporate Christ is the church 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not be quick in answering others questions about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to learn to speak to others in a proper way so that we do not give them ground for misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Someone may ask if our meetings are quiet or noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If I were asked this, I would say, Friend, your question is a question of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not have religion we have the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are not a noisy church, nor are we a quiet church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are a church that seeks to be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because the human mind today is filled with religious concepts, there are endless questions about our practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such religious questions are related to matters such as head covering, pray-reading, physical appearance, and the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In my years of ministering for the Lord, no one ever asked me if the churches in the Lord s recovery seek to be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must be careful in how we answer religious questions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Anything that we do for God apart from Christ is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are religion-conscious, but God wants us to be Christ-conscious.</S>
