Sometimes we just read over these verses without at all realizing their intent. I believe that according to the context of all these Psalms the &#8220;good&#8221; mentioned here includes many things. It includes the building up of the wall of the city, as mentioned in the last part of the verse. The building up of the walls of Jerusalem is indeed one item of the &#8220;good.&#8221; Following that, the city must have the glory of God. God must fill it with His glory. Then the presence of God must be continually with the city, and God&#8217;s very presence supplies the peace, the joy, the light, the life, the security, and all the blessings of the city. The &#8220;good&#8221; here includes all these things. We also need to pray in this way: &#8220;Do good unto the church in thy good pleasure.&#8221; And when we pray we must have faith to believe that the Lord is going to do good. The Lord will build up the church, He will fill it with His glory, His very presence will be with the church, and His presence will bring joy, peace, life, light, security, and all kinds of blessings. In all the years that I have been in this country for the Lord&#8217;s testimony, I have had the assurance that the Lord is going to do good in His good pleasure to the church. He is going to build up the church, fill it with His glory, and grant the church His presence with abundant spiritual blessing. Praise the Lord! Many of us can testify how wonderfully the Lord has already done good in His good pleasure unto His church in this land.<p>Psalm 52:8 goes on to tell how the saints grow in the house of God and trust in His lovingkindness. &#8220;But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.&#8221; Nearly all the verses in the Psalms concerning the house of God include the meaning of the house being a place not only for God but also for us to dwell. From the very first mention of the house in the Psalms, &#8220;I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever,&#8221; the house is not only God&#8217;s dwelling place, it is our dwelling place. Praise the Lord! But in Psalm 52:8 the meaning implied is even deeper and stronger than dwelling in the house. The Psalmist compares himself to a green olive tree planted in the house of God. If you are only dwelling in the house, you may easily move out, but if you are planted in the house of God, it is extremely difficult for you to leave. Let me ask you, brothers and sisters, are you dwelling in the house of God, or are you planted in the house of God? Before we can grow in the house, we must be planted there. The Psalmist says he is like a green olive tree-he is not withered, but green and growing. The house of God is not only a place to dwell, but a place to grow. And the olive tree is a tree which produces oil, the type of the Spirit. It is so meaningful. May we all be green olive trees in the house of God.<p>The Psalmist continues, &#8220;I trust in the lovingkindness of God for ever and ever.&#8221; Many times people say that they trust in God. But if you are not in God&#8217;s house, it is rather difficult for you to put your trust in God. In a strict sense God is in His house; hence, if you are not in His house, how can you put your trust in Him? You may endeavor, you may struggle, and you may do many things to trust in God; but when you come into the local church, God&#8217;s house, it is extremely easy. To trust in God means to be in God&#8217;s house.<p>Furthermore, the salvation of God&#8217;s people comes out of the local churches. Psalm 53:6, &#8220;Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!&#8221; It is in the local churches that we are saved from so many things. We are saved from our worldliness, from our temper, from our selves, from our old background, from religion, from empty teachings and dead letters and from so many other things.<p>Then in Psalm 55:14, the Psalmist said that he &#8220;took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.&#8221; The Psalms have been in my hands for years, but not until recently did I notice this verse. To be in the house of God is really too good; so whenever we talk about it, it is a kind of sweet counsel. Hallelujah! Brothers, let us take sweet counsel together; then let us walk to the house of God in company. The house of God is so sweet to us.<p>Moreover, the saints long to abide in God&#8217;s tabernacle for ever and enjoy the shelter of God&#8217;s wings (Psa. 61:4). When we abide in the house of God, we are sheltered beneath God&#8217;s wings. What an enjoyment this is! God is like a great hen, and we are like little chicks abiding under His wings. We are sheltered by His wings, and we are also sheltered by His house. We are doubly sheltered. How safe it is! How sweet it is! I do believe many of you have this feeling when you are in the local church.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
