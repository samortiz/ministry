<p><em>Question: In my experience the most enjoyable times have been times of corporately seeking the Lord. How does the matter of living Christ relate to the corporate experience of Christ?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The corporate aspect of the Christian life is certainly helpful, but what we often lack is a daily life of walking according to the spirit. The saints in a local church may experience a high corporate life for a time, but if they do not enter into the practice of walking according to the spirit, their enjoyment will eventually diminish. Many of us have experienced a high corporate life in the past. Today we need to enter into the actual practice of walking according to the spirit, and as leading ones, we need to help others to balance their corporate enjoyment of the Lord with a personal daily life of walking according to the spirit. Whether or not there is a high atmosphere of corporate enjoyment in our locality, we need to personally walk according to the spirit. Corporate exercise of the spirit helps our walking according to the spirit but cannot replace it. Our walking according to the spirit is our spiritual breathing, which is what enables us to endure. To stop breathing is an indication of death. We need to pay our full attention to walking according to the spirit, because our breathing is what matters.</p>
<p>Many saints need to practice walking according to the spirit in order to become less dependent on corporate help. The Lord may place us in an environment in which we do not have much opportunity to meet with others. The apostle John did not receive corporate help when he was in exile on the island of Patmos, but he was still in spirit (Rev. 1:10). We need to practice to be in spirit when we are alone.</p>
<p><em>Question: Many times I have experienced being led by the Spirit to do something, but while I am doing it, I am not walking according to the spirit or living Christ. Therefore, I do not minister Christ to those I contact. Could you say something further about living Christ?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Paul could say, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). We need to consider whether we can say this according to our experience. We may have this teaching and perhaps even this revelation and vision, but we must admit that we do not adequately have this living, even if we say and do many good things. Deep within we realize that it is mostly we who are living and not Christ, perhaps even when we are speaking about the Lord. This shows our lack.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the kind of people God desires to gain is a people who live Christ. Because we are still influenced by many other things, such as our background, knowledge, and environment, we miss the mark of living Christ and walking according to the spirit. Because the matter of living Christ pertains to life, which is mysterious and abstract, it is easy for us to miss and neglect this matter. Nevertheless, the Lord has shown us His desire, and He will not let us go. Once we have seen the matter of living Christ, there is nothing else to which we can give ourselves. We must practice this, pay our full attention to this, live this, and minister this to others. Living Christ and ministering such a life to others may seem to be a slow work, but it is the most effective work because it is a matter of life. Life is never defeated; it always prevails. We need to realize that any kind of organizational work will not last. We must minister life, because life endures.</p>
<p>Our lack today is a daily living of walking according to the spirit. In order to see this matter, we need to be unloaded by setting aside what we think we know. After mentioning walking according to the spirit in Romans 8:4, Paul goes on to describe such a walk. In verses 5 through 17 he does not correct the believers or give them a charge or a command; instead, he explains the genuine Christian walk, which is a walk according to the spirit. This walk involves the Spirit and our spirit, and it affects our mind and our mortal body. The Spirit is in our spirit, forming a mingled spirit, and when we walk according to this mingled spirit, life is imparted to our spirit, mind, and body (vv. 10, 6, 11). After the Triune God in Christ was processed and achieved and attained everything for His purpose, He became the life-giving, all-inclusive Spirit, who is the Spirit of God the Father, the Spirit of Christ the Son, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead (vv. 9, 11). Therefore, the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. This Spirit is in our spirit, witnessing with our spirit (v. 16). These two spirits are one. The Triune God mingles with the tripartite man in the spirit. Therefore, what we need is simply to walk according to the mingled spirit. Romans 8 does not teach that we should try to improve ourselves through ethics, morality, or religion; instead, it teaches that we need to walk according to the mingled spirit. The focus of Romans 8 is walking according to the mingled spirit, which is the practical way to live Christ. Such a living is our need today. The outward results of our work may pass away; therefore, what really counts in the eyes of God is our living of Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
