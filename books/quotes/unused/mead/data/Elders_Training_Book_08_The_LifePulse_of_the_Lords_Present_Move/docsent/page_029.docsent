   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DOING ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE ONE WHO EMPOWERS US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another aspect of being full-time is shown in Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Philippians 4:13 Paul says, I can do all things in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Probably we have never related this verse to being full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be a job-dropping full-timer is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In ourselves we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Philippians 4:13 is related to Paul s being such a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No one can do it except those who do it in the One who empowers them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all need such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are thinking to take the full-time way, you must realize that it is only possible for you to do it in Christ who empowers you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not think, Well, it might be all right because in my locality the church has over one hundred fifty people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Surely they can support me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To think this way is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the same as being hired by your church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You should not consider in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When all those thousands of scattered saints from Jerusalem went to Samaria, how could the Samaritans support them?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How could they get a job?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who supported them?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They must have lived of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They did this in the One who empowered them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE HIGHEST EXAMPLE OF BEING FULL-TIME</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The highest example of being full-time was the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Up to the age of thirty, He made a living by being a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In all those years He had a job, but then He came out at age thirty to serve God with His full time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nobody paid Him or hired Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was tempted in the wilderness by the Devil concerning His living Matt 4:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit led Him into this temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not enter into temptation by doing something wrong, like we sometimes have done.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many times we have gotten into temptation because of our mistakes, but the Lord Jesus was brought into that temptation by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This temptation was a test to prove that He was qualified to be the King for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord s fasting was also the Spirit s leading, and His fasting led Him into a position to be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For forty days He did not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then He became hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At this point the Devil tempted Him to perform a miracle to make the stones become loaves of bread Matt 4:3 to prove that He was the Son of God, that God was really with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the Lord Jesus would not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>FOLLOWING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AND TRUSTING IN HIM FOR OUR LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you go full-time, sometimes you also will be led by the Spirit into a hunger, with nothing to eat and nothing to live on.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time you will be tempted by the Devil who would say to you, You are a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Surely you can pray that God would do something as a miracle for you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eating is always a trap used by the Devil to snare man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus, humanly speaking, was mainly supported by His followers who were the women.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These women not only supported Him, but they also supported His other followers Luke 8:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter, James, and John all gave up their fishing occupations and became crazy in following Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They traveled around, going through the villages with no certain place to stay and no assurance of something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They just liked to be with this Person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord was like a magnet who drew and attracted them to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord said that the foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere that He may lay His head Matt 8:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even though He did not have a resting place, the disciples just wanted to be with Him where He was.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Their fortune was just to be with Him without any concern for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The job-dropping full-timers should be honest with their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Tell them you are not sure where your support will come from.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Tell them you feel that the Lord wants you to go full-time, and that you will follow Jesus and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The husbands who are burdened to be full-time also have to fellowship with their wives honestly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They should not assure them with promises of security.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You cannot assure your wife with any security.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All you can do is ask her to go the full-time way with you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Does this kind of talk disappoint you?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If so, then you should go back to your job.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thousands of people got helped, healed, and saved by the Lord, but eventually only a hundred and twenty remained with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time the Jewish people were threatening all the followers of Jesus but these hundred and twenty were not afraid of this kind of threatening.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For ten days they did nothing but pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may wonder how they lived, but they just lived.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Bible is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It does not tell us how these people were supported, how they survived.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet they survived.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Would you still take this way?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no promise that anyone will support you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No one would beg you or put you on the payroll.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Just do it in Him who empowers you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When I became a full-timer no one hired me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The church was small and could not support me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Mainly it was only my brother and I who supported the church because only we made good salaries.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>That was over fifty years ago, when the world s financial situation was very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The living standard was very low, and it was hard to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A teacher in high school could only make about twelve to fifteen dollars a month, which was only good for two or three persons to live on.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It was hard for every family to have any savings.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I realized this and others reminded me that it was mainly only my brother and I who supported the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I was also reminded by some that if I gave up my job, I would need somebody to support me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some said, You are now supporting the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When you become one who is supported, who will support you?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I did not know, but I made a resolution to live in a very simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As long as I could live, I did not care.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>That was my intention.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I was burdened to give up my job just to preach Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In case you still could not make a living, you can make tents ; you have a good example in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We may be strange and peculiar persons whom others cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They will say, Is this not your job?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>No, it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Paul made tents, and he even had co-workers, Priscilla and Aquila, working in the same trade.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The church in Rome Rom 16:5 and in Ephesus 1 Cor 16:19 cf.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Acts 18:18-19, 26 met in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They were so much for the Lord s interest, yet they still made tents.</S>
