   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE LORD S RECOVERY EATING Scripture Reading: Rev 2:4, 7, 14-15, 17, 20, 24; 3:20; 22:14 I. A PROFOUND CONCEPT IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible contains a very profound thought that cannot be fathomed or perceived without revelation: God wants to enter into man to be man s life that He and man might have the same life, the same nature, and the living of the same kind of being a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is neither a religious notion nor a moral concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God created man to be a vessel for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man is God s vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regardless of how noble and excellent you may be, you are nevertheless just a vessel for God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only God should be your content.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you do not have God s life and nature and if you are not filled with God, you are an empty vessel, and your human life, your living, your feeling, and your activities are all vain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They come to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is what God has planned and ordained for man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE WAY TO ACHIEVE GOD S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can God achieve His purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consider the physical symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order for something, such as chicken, to come into us to be our element and to be one with us, we have to eat it, digest it, and assimilate it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the way it becomes our blood, our cells, and our essence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With a view to this, the Lord said, I am the bread of life....He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me John 6:48, 57b .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only by eating the Lord can we receive God into us as our content.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only do we need to understand, apprehend, know, love, believe, follow, and worship the Lord; even more we need to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>CHRISTIANITY S LOSS AND TODAY S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christianity tells people to believe in Jesus, love the Lord, follow Christ, and serve Christ; but it has lost the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do these things for the purpose of receiving the Lord into us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They are the procedures to reach the goal eating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today the Lord wants to recover the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To believe in the Lord is not just for our sins to be forgiven or for us to go to heaven; rather, it is for us to receive the Lord into us that He may be mingled with us as one essence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The apostle Paul said, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was even able to say, For to me, to live is Christ Phil 1:21 , because Christ in him was his life and his essence and Christ had become one with him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE LINE OF EATING IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s desire for man is that man may eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After God created man, He did not tell him to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, He placed Himself before man in the form of food to be received by man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is edible for man to take Him in. He wants to enter into us, not only to be our life, but also to be our continuing life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The line of eating is consistent throughout the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the first two chapters of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation, the matter of eating is repeatedly referred to.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the children of Israel were leaving Egypt, they had to eat the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the wilderness they ate the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After they entered into Canaan, they ate the rich produce of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When they offered sacrifices in their worship to God, they ate the various offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Lord Jesus came, He said that He is the bread of life and that we have to eat Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even in the Lord s table meetings when we remember the Lord, our emphasis should not be on meditation and worship but on eating.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Concerning the bread, He told the disciples, Take, eat; this is My body Matt 26:26b .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, He said, Do this in remembrance of Me Luke 22:19b .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the true remembrance of the Lord is eating, which is for us to exercise our spirit to receive the Lord into us again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more we eat and drink the Lord, the more real our worship to Him is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>True worship is for us to open our inner being to the Lord for Him to fill and saturate us more.</S>
