   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE A LIFE FULLY ACCORDING TO AND FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 4 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:1, 4, 9-10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall continue to see from the Gospel of Mark a life that is fully according to and for the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not an easy matter to study the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because we may be led astray in understanding this book, it is quite difficult to study it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the past many of us were misled in our efforts to understand this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some regard the Gospel of Mark merely as a biography of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Others consider this Gospel simply a book of stories concerning Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, it is not wrong to say that the Gospel of Mark is a biography or a book of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This book is a biography of the Lord, and it does contain many stories concerning His life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if we get into the depths of the Gospel of Mark, we shall see that this Gospel is more than a biography or a book of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Gospel of Mark presents a life that lives fully according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE BEGINNING OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this message we need to pay particular attention to 1:1: The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse is not the title of a biography or of a book of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here we have three main terms: the beginning, the gospel, and Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word gospel is used in 1:1 in a new way, in a way not employed previously.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From Adam until Jesus Christ there was nothing in man s culture or civilization to correspond to what is denoted by the word gospel in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both John 1:1 and Mark 1:1 use the word beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here beginning denotes eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John s use of this word is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Mark, on the contrary, speaks of the beginning of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Gospel of Mark is unique among the four Gospels in opening with the clear expression the beginning of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to be deeply impressed with the opening word of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The phrase the beginning of the gospel indicates that this book is not merely a biography of a Nazarene named Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither is this merely a book of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, this book speaks concerning the beginning of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At least to a certain extent or in a certain sense, we may regard the entire book of Mark as the beginning of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Continuation of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If Mark is the beginning of the gospel, where is the continuation of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The continuation of the gospel is seen on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the chosen and prepared disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peter, James, John, and the other disciples had been chosen by God and personally called by Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After they had been called, they were prepared by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the ten days before Pentecost, the one hundred and twenty were praying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you know where they were in those days?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were in the heavens, in the Lord s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They had been brought into the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the day of Pentecost they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, on that day there was the continuation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, Mark is the beginning of the gospel, and Acts is the continuation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This continuation has not yet ended.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that we today are still in the continuation of the gospel.</S>
