 <h2 class="head2">B. Having Died and Risen</h2>
<p>Brothers, when we step into the water of baptism or when we look back after being believers for many years, we must remember that we are already dead. We allowed others to bury us because we believed that we were already dead. If our heart is still beating and we are still breathing, we cannot be buried. In order to be buried, we must be dead.</p>
<p>When the Lord was crucified, we were crucified too. We allowed others to put us into the water because we believed that we had died. The Lord Jesus has resurrected; He has put His resurrection power within us. Now we are regenerated through this power. This resurrection power operates within us and causes us to be resurrected. This is why we rose from the water. We are no longer our former self; we are now resurrected persons. Today, we must always remind ourselves of this matter. When we went into the water, we believed that we died and needed to be buried. When we came up from the water, we believed that we had newness of life. Now we are on the side of resurrection. Death is on the other side, but resurrection is on this side.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. I Am in Christ</h2>
<p>Once I saw a headline in the newspaper which read, &ldquo;One Person, Three Lives.&rdquo; The article was about a pregnant woman who had been murdered. After the woman died, it became known that she was pregnant with twins. Hence, the headline read, &ldquo;One Person, Three Lives.&rdquo; Please note that concerning the Lord, it is, &ldquo;One Person, Millions of Lives.&rdquo; This is why the Bible repeatedly emphasizes the words <em>in Christ.</em> In the murder spoken of above, the murderer apparently killed only the mother; he did not kill the two children. However, because the two children were in their mother&rsquo;s womb, they died when their mother died. Likewise, since we are in Christ, when Christ died, we died in Him.</p>
<p>God has put us into Christ Jesus. This is the revelation in 1 Corinthians 1:30: &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Since Christ has died, we are all dead. The basis for our co-death with Christ is our being in Christ. If we do not know what being in Christ means, we will not understand what dying with Him means either. How could the children die with their mother? They died because they were in their mother&rsquo;s womb. The analogy in the spiritual realm is even more real. God has joined us to Christ. When Christ died, we died also.</p>
<p>As soon as this gospel is preached to us, we should learn to look from God&rsquo;s viewpoint and acknowledge that we have died in the Lord. We have died because we believed this to be a fact. We have been buried in the water and have come out of it. We declare that we are on this side of the tomb. This is resurrection. Reckoning in Romans 6 involves both reckoning oneself dead in Christ Jesus and reckoning oneself alive in Him as well.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, I hope that you will take this way once you are saved. These are two separate thoughts. One thought comes before baptism, and the other comes after baptism. Before baptism we must see that we have already died and that we need to be buried. After baptism we must realize that we are in resurrection and that we can therefore serve God today.</p>
