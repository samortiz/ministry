They were given as part of a training to encourage and help young believers to read the Bible.<br><br>These lessons are meant to provide only a very simple and brief overview of 1) the Bible, 2) its completion, 3) its subject, central thought, and sections, and 4) the principles for interpreting the Bible. They are published to meet the present need of many who have recently been saved.
