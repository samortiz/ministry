   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO FOUR NEW THINGS Scripture Reading: Matt 9:14-17; Luke 5:33-39</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen how Christ presented Himself to the people as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He said, "Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these words of His we see several things: firstly, that He is the Bridegroom, and secondly, that the Bridegroom is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You remember that in Matthew chapter 1 we are told that Christ was called Emmanuel, which means God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I really like these two words "with us."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This does not mean that we have a certain doctrine or know the teaching, nor does it mean that we keep a kind of ritual or have any forms.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It means that we have His very presence with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His being with us means everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hallelujah, the Bridegroom is with us!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without His presence, everything is just religious.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does it mean to be religious?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be religious means to have all the scriptural things, all the fundamental things, and yet lack the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How wonderful it is to have the presence of the Bridegroom with us!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you need comfort?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Praise the Lord, His presence is your comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you need life?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise the Lord, His presence is your life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you need anything else?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I tell you, His presence is everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you have His presence, you have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Oh, the Bridegroom is with us!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The third implication of these words of the Lord is that He as the Bridegroom is with us that we may enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How do we know this?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because He says, "Can the children of the bridechamber mourn?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The answer is obvious: we must be joyful; we cannot be otherwise in the presence of the Bridegroom Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the Lord did not stop here: He went on to amplify His statement by using some parables with much practical implication.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First of all, He stated that no man puts a piece of new cloth upon an old garment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Following that, He tells us that neither do men put new wine into old wineskins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Gospel of Luke we have another item added: "No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old" 5:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, following the Lord's words regarding Himself as the Bridegroom, He presents us with four new things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are full of significance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Firstly, we see the new cloth; secondly, the new garment; thirdly, the new wine; and lastly, the new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have, therefore, the bridegroom with four new things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord's word is always so simple in clauses, phrases, and wording.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we must realize that the implication of the Lord's word is marvelous and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The words of the Lord are not like those of philosophers: they always use words very difficult to understand, and even after you understand them you have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Praise the Lord, He is different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All His words are exceedingly simple everyone is familiar with a new cloth, a new garment, new wine, and a new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But listen, the implication and significance of His words are profound.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eternity is required to comprehend them.</S>
