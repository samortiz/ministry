   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SELLING ONE'S ALL IMPOSSIBLE WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT POSSIBLE WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Luke 18 the Lord told the young ruler that he had to sell his all to follow Him before he could inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The young man thought the requirement was too high, and he left in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After this the Lord told the disciples that it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>18-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let me explain this a little more in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only is a camel too big; even a mouse is too big to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The real issue here is that entrance into the kingdom is hard not only for a rich man but for any man who depends on himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only God can do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the past two thousand years, thank God, many camels have passed through the needle's eye.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The mistake of the young ruler was in trying to do it by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His mistake was not in loving his riches but in his thought that God could not do it because he himself could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all love money; none of us can give up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God becomes the source of our faith, however, even a camel can go through the needle's eye.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We think that it is impossible with man, but we have forgotten that it is possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No man can go through the eye of a needle; no man can hand himself over, but God does not say that we have to do it by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He says that we can do it by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we call on Him for help, even a camel can go through the needle's eye.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that we cannot do it, but it is wrong to think that God cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is true that everyone loves money and that no one is willing to forsake everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, what is impossible with man is possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the reason we find Zaccheus in Luke 19.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know that it is easy for a young man to become excited.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he is burning, he can throw away his money easily, but an old man has handled money for many years; he knows what money can bring him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is hard to change an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Mammon is like opium; if we only take a little of it, we can drop it easily, but if we take a great deal of it, it will be hard to shake the addiction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we take, the harder it is to be free from it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord said to Zaccheus that He would go into his house that very day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most people would object to such a move and think, "Lord, You are an outsider from another town.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You do not know Zaccheus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You have been fooled by him."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the Lord ignored such thoughts vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To everyone's surprise, Zaccheus stood up and said, "Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much" v. 8 . Zaccheus only caught a glimpse of the Lord's glory, and everything he had was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He saw one glimpse of Christ, and he forsook everything to follow Him that same day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is surely a camel going through the eye of a needle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Lord saw what Zaccheus had done, He said, "Today salvation has come to this house" v. 9 . If Zaccheus had tried to do it by himself, he would not have succeeded, but salvation came to his house, and he did it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In comparing verse 5 with verse 9, we can see that salvation refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The young man in chapter eighteen had his eyes set on man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was the reason he could not go through the eye of the needle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The old man in chapter nineteen set his eyes on the salvation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the reason he was able to go through the eye of the needle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, but during the past two thousand years, countless numbers of people have done this, emerging from the other side to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man truly wants to follow the Lord and truly trusts in the Lord, the Lord will enable him go through the eye of the needle.</S>
