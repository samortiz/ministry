   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Christ s Divine Nature His Divinity 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the Spirit of Holiness,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ Being Designated the Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 1:4 says that Christ s humanity was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here the Spirit of holiness is different from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Divine Trinity there are three Persons, and the third One is the Holy Spirit, but the Spirit in Romans 1:4 is the same as that mentioned in John 4:24, where the Lord Jesus said, God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This does not mean that God is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To say that God is the Holy Spirit is right, but John 4:24 does not refer to the Holy Spirit of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It refers to the Spirit as God s essence, God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To say that God is Spirit is like saying that a stand made of steel is steel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Steel is the very essence of the stand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same way, Spirit is the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Christ became a man, picking up humanity, He did not give up His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He came to be a man in His divinity, and that divinity is the Spirit, as mentioned in Romans 1:4 and John 4:24.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ, while He was on the earth, was both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to His being a man, He was the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to His being God, He was the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is one person of two natures, the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The human nature is the flesh, and the divine nature is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Peter 3:18 says that when Christ was being put to death on the cross, His flesh was being put to death, not His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His Spirit, at the same time, was very active, was made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One person was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to His flesh, He was crucified, but according to His Spirit, He was very active, made strong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the Spirit of holiness, Christ was designated the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the flesh, He was the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But according to the Spirit, He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to His humanity, He was the Son of Man, but how could His humanity become the Son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is one of the hardest points in the Bible for us to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are human beings, so we are all sons of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can God make us His children?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God does this by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Human beings are the sons of man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s children are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We human beings have been made children of God by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regeneration is God coming into us, into our spirit, to be an element added into our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In regeneration our human spirit was made divine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we were regenerated by God, we were made divine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same principle, while Christ was on this earth before His resurrection, a part of Him, His humanity, was not divine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That human part was the Son of Man, not the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In His death His human part was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then in His resurrection God the Spirit as Christ s divinity was made strong, very active, to put divinity into the humanity of Christ to make it divine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the same principle of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before Christ s resurrection, Christ s humanity was just human.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But in Christ s resurrection, His divinity as the Spirit was made strong to impart Himself into His humanity to make it divine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, Christ became the Son of God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Son of God in resurrection is different from the only begotten Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only begotten Son of God was only divine, without humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the Son of God in resurrection is both divine and human, so this Son of God is not the Only Begotten but the Firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus, we may say that Christ in His humanity was the first one regenerated, so He became our firstborn Brother, and we became His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He and we all were regenerated in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ephesians 2 reveals that in our spirit we were dead in offenses, but when Christ in His resurrection was made alive, we were made alive together with Him v. 5 . His humanity was crucified, but in resurrection His humanity was made alive by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ephesians 2 says we were made alive and resurrected with Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This confirms Romans 1.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We were regenerated by being made alive with Christ, by being raised up with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First Peter 1:3 tells us that in the resurrection of Christ, God has regenerated all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Power</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Power in Romans 1:4 is the power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The phrase inpower corresponds with 1 Peter 3:18, which says that Christ s flesh was put to death, but His Spirit was made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To be made alive means to be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Out of Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ came to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He came out of the seed of David, so the seed of David is the source of Christ s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then Christ s humanity through resurrection became the Son of God out of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As the Son of Man, He came out of the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As the Son of God, He came out of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The resurrection is the Triune God embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus, the embodiment of the Triune God, said, I am the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>That means the Triune God is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If there were no God, there would be no resurrection in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Resurrection is God, and this is the source out of which the firstborn Son of God came into being.</S>
