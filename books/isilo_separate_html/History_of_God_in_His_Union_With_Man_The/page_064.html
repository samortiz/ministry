Having Destined Him<br>to Live a Struggling Life All His Days</H2><P>God destined Jacob to live a struggling life all his days. His life was absolutely different from the life of Isaac. Isaac's life had no struggle, just enjoyment. But Jacob's life was full of troubles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Struggling from His Mother's Womb<br>to Be the Firstborn</H2><P>Even from his mother's womb, he struggled to be the firstborn of the twins (25:22-26a). Even before he was brought forth in birth, he struggled with his brother. Jacob wanted to be the first.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2.

Peoples would serve him and nations would bow down to him. Jacob would be lord over his brethren, and his mother's sons would bow down to him (v. 29a). Then Isaac told Jacob, "Cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee" (v. 29b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Forced to Leave His Parents<br>and Go to His Uncle Laban</H2><P>Jacob struggled for the blessing of the firstborn son, and because of this, he had to suffer. He was forced by his brother's hatred and his mother's partial love and natural wisdom to leave his parents and go to his uncle Laban (27:41&#151;28:5).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> </body></html>
