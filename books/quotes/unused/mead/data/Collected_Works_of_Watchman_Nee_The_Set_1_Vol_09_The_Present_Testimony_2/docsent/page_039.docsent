   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW COVENANT 2 Issue No. 24 Scripture Reading: Matt 26:28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This morning I spoke about the difference between a promise and a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This afternoon, I still want to say something more about the difference between a promise and a fact so that you can become clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A promise is what God says before something is done, and a fact is what God says after something has been done.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A promise is God's intention concerning something that is not yet done, while a fact is His declaration after His move and His acts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the difference between God's promise and His fact.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to see one thing concerning God's promise: a believer has to receive it in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning God's fact, we have to receive it in faith, and we also have to apply His accomplished facts and act as if we believe that they are accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since God has given something to us, we do not have to repeatedly ask Him to do the same thing; all we have to do is apply what God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now let us say something concerning the difference between God's promise and His fact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every time we read the Bible, we have to ask if what we are reading is a promise or a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If it is a promise, all we have to do is ask in faith, and we will receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If it is a fact, we do not have to even ask; all we have to do is apply by faith, and we will have it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is all we will say for now concerning the difference between a promise and a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we will add another thing: the difference between God's covenant made with an oath, and His promises and facts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the morning, we said that God's Word concerning grace includes three aspects: promises, facts, and covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This afternoon, we will cover the covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every heart taught by grace should praise God for His established covenants with man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have never encountered difficulties, we do not know the wonder and preciousness of God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why does God establish covenants with man?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are God's promises insufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's promises are indeed precious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have never experienced poverty, suffering, sickness, or danger we do not know the preciousness of God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are poor, God's promises will supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we will realize that His promises are manna from heaven and springs in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we are in serious sickness, or when we are helpless and without aid from anyone, God's promises help and heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we encounter perils, dangers, and sufferings, God's messengers will look upon us, deliver us, and comfort us according to His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only then will we realize that God's promises are sweet as honey, refreshing as water, and a rock of shadow in a dry land.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we have no danger, here we are revived, and here we are allowed to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unless we pass through great tribulations, sufferings, and dangers, we will never know the preciousness and sweetness of God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While God's promises are precious, His facts are more available than His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God not only gives us promises which will be fulfilled; He has also given us facts that are already fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today God is not only giving us promises and accomplished facts; He is also making covenants with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is more glorious for God to make a covenant with us than for Him to promise or accomplish something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When God establishes a covenant with us, He binds Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A covenant takes away God's own freedom so that we can have all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who established the covenants with man?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God established them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you know the meaning of a covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A covenant is something righteous; a covenant relates to justice and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we mention a covenant, there cannot be any consideration of personal desire, pleasure, or grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A covenant can only be executed according to righteousness, justice, and the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Grace cannot execute a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose that I agreed to give a brother five dollars every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not ask why I would make such a covenant with the brother; just remember that if I made such a covenant, I would have to give him five dollars every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since I made such a covenant and signed my name in the covenant, I would be unrighteous and dishonest if I did not keep this covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I would be acting contrary and unfaithfully to my own words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This would immediately lower my own moral standard.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Doing this would be acting contrary to law and justice; rather, I would be acting according to my own will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Have you seen that when God makes a covenant with man, He puts Himself in a very restricted position?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is able to deal with man according to His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If He so desired, He could deal with you in grace, and if He did not desire, He could deal with you harshly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If He so desired, He could save you one day, and if He did not desire, He could choose not to save you the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If God is not bound by a covenant, He can act freely according to His own pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If He is outside a covenant, He can hold back His will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He has the freedom to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If He wants to do something, He can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If He does not want to do something, He can choose not to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if God has made a covenant, He is bound by it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has to act according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is bound by the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God has sacrificed His desires and His freedom for the sake of the covenant!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brothers and sisters, do you realize that this is the highest expression of grace?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is not just God's promising us a plenitude of food and raiment, or deliverance from dangers and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is not just the declaration of God's accomplished facts for our application.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is God putting Himself in our position; God has put Himself in a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whether or not He likes it, God has to carry out the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No matter what His desire is, He has to carry the covenant out.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He cannot change the words in His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What a wonderful thing that God has established covenants with us.</S>
