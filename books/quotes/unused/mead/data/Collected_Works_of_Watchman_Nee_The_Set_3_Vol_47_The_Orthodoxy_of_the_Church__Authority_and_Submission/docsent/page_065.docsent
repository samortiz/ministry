   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE PROPER LIMIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Heb 11:23; Exo 1:17; Dan 3:17-18; 6:10; Matt 2:13; Acts 5:29 SUBMISSION BEING ABSOLUTE,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BUT OBEDIENCE BEING RELATIVE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Submission is a matter of attitude, but obedience is a matter of conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Acts 4:19 says, "But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you judge."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The apostles, however, were not rebellious in their spirit; they were still submitting to all those who were in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Obedience is not absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some authorities we have to obey, but others we cannot obey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The latter include those who touch on basic matters of the Christian faith, such as our belief in the Lord and the liberty of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A son can say anything to his father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But there cannot be any attitude of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our submission should always be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In some matters we can be obedient at the same time that we are submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other matters we cannot be obedient, but we still have to remain submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these are a matter of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acts 15 is an example of a church conference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a conference we can suggest or debate.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when the decision is reached, everyone should be submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE LIMIT OF OBEYING THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If there are parents who force their children to stop attending church meetings, the children should be submissive in their attitude, but they must not obey.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is like the apostles preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Jewish synagogue stopped them, they were submissive in their attitude, but in practice they went on according to the commission of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They chose to preach the gospel rather than be restricted by the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was not a defiance with quarrels and shouting, but a defiance with calmness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At any rate, there must never be any attitude of stubbornness or words of contradiction against those in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once a man meets authority, he becomes soft and pliant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The submission of a person in heart, attitude, and words must be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There must not be any stubbornness or rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the deputy authority the one representing God's authority clashes with the direct authority God , one must be submissive to the deputy authority but must not be obedient to it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will summarize the matter in three points:</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>1 Obedience is a matter of conduct; it is relative.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Submission is a matter of attitude; it is absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2 Only God is the object of unlimited submission.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man, who is less than God, should only receive limited submission.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3 If the deputy authority gives an order that is obviously contrary to God's order, we can only submit; we cannot obey.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must submit only to the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not obey the orders that are contrary to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If parents ask their children to go to places that the children do not like to go to, and if there is no sin involved in the matter, we have a borderline case.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Submission is absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But obedience is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If your parents force you to go, then you have no choice but to go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if they do not force you to do it, you do not have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If all children have this attitude, God will release them in their environments.</S>
