   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE MOVE OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOSPEL SERVICE 6 Scripture Reading: Mark 7:24-30</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Gospel of Mark is a progressive book, a record of the Lord s life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt, whatever the Lord experienced was sovereign, for God arranged the environment so that the Lord would experience certain things in His earthly life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus far, we have seen the contents of the Slave-Savior s gospel service, the ways to carry out this service, and the auxiliary acts for the gospel service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have also seen that, in chapter four, the Lord Jesus gave a strong word concerning the intrinsic element of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following this, He exercised His authority, the authority of the kingdom, to deal with man s outward situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning this, we have in Mark a picture of human society.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also have a picture showing the attitude of the worldly people toward the Lord s gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then in chapter seven there is a turn from the dealing with man s outward situation to the dealing with the inward condition of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE SYROPHOENICIAN WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AND THE CHILDREN S BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this message we shall consider the case of the Syrophoenician woman 7:24-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Mark 7:24 tells us that the Lord went away into the districts of Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, came to Him and fell at His feet v. 25 . The woman was a Greek, Syrophoenician by race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She was a Syrian by tongue, Phoenician by race see Acts 21:2-3 , and, the Phoenicians being descendants of the Canaanites, a Canaanite woman Matt 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What made her a Greek religion, marriage, or something else is difficult to discover.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament the word Greek is used to signify the Gentile world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This woman was a typical Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may say that she was manifoldly a Gentile, for she was a Greek, a Syrophoenician, and a Canaanite.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, she came to ask the Lord to do something for her.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She wanted Him to cast a demon out of her daughter v. 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because this Syrophoenician woman was such a Gentile, the Lord Jesus said to her, Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children s bread and throw it to the little dogs v. 27 . Here the Lord seemed to be saying to her, As a Gentile, you are a little dog, and I cannot throw the children s bread to you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are not qualified to be one of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are qualified only to be a Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because I must satisfy the children first, I should not take the children s bread and throw it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In chapter six of the Gospel of John the Lord clearly told the Jews that He is the bread of life John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He indicated to them that He is the bread of God, the One who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world John 6:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He came down from heaven to be the bread of life to satisfy the hunger of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although a word concerning this was clearly given in John 6, there is not such a word in the synoptic Gospels, in Matthew, Mark, or Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in Mark 7:27 the Lord Jesus used the word bread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said that the bread should first be given to the children.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What the Lord says concerning the children s bread in verse 27 indicates that He did not come simply to do miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus came to feed the hungry children.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s word here definitely indicates that in the previous chapters the Lord was feeding the people.</S>
