   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST LIVING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although it is a wonderful and glorious fact that we are now in Christ, this is nevertheless just a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This position does give us the right and privilege to participate in all that Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But with this right and privilege, we need to experience Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now that we are in Christ, Christ wants to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not a matter of position, but a matter of experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For us to be in Christ is a matter of position; for Christ to be in us is a matter of experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How much we enjoy Christ depends upon how much He lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we were not in Christ, Christ could not be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the New Testament, Christ s being in us is based upon the fact that we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 15:4, the Lord Jesus said, Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we abide in Christ, He will abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once again we see that to be in Christ is a matter of position, whereas to have Christ in us is a matter of experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My burden in this message is not to tell you that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is to point out that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Simply knowing that we are in Christ does not give us the experience of Christ or the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, this position does give us the right and privilege to claim the enjoyment and experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should have the confidence to say that we are in Christ wholly, absolutely, and thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Concerning our position in Christ, we may be assured that we are in Him entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, anyone who is an American citizen is a citizen wholly, thoroughly, and absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His citizenship is not partial or conditional.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, how much this person enjoys America is relative to how much of America has gotten into him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is in America, but how much of America is in him?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A person from another country may become a naturalized American citizen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, he is altogether an American by citizenship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, he may still have within him a great deal of his native country.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that although he is in America, not that much of America has yet entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Inwardly, he still loves many things of his native country.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same principle, we are in Christ absolutely, but He is in us just relatively and conditionally.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, according to our experience, we do not have very much of Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To a very large degree, we are still occupied and possessed by our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we may have been in the church life in the Lord s recovery for many years, there is still room for much more of the church to be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although we may have been in Christ for a long time, in experience we still do not have very much of Him in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>OCCUPIED BY CULTURE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need a clear understanding of what it means to say that Christ is versus culture.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although Christ is in us, we are occupied more by culture than by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are filled with many things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These things include our likes and dislikes, our preferences and choices, and our sin and worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more Christ as grace is ministered into us, the more those things which occupy us are discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, although many sinful and worldly things may be discharged rather easily, our culture still remains, no matter how much grace is ministered into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Anything that is in us apart from Christ Himself frustrates us from the genuine experience of Christ and enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is especially true of the culture within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the years we have been in the church life, many things have been discharged from our being, as grace has been added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nevertheless, one thing remains in us in a very subtle way, and that thing is culture.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is difficult to discern the culture in us and to condemn it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we do not recognize our culture for what it is, we do not easily discern it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we may condemn the sinful and worldly elements in us, we probably do not condemn our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our culture may be very strong, but we may not be conscious of it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may even think that we are not under the influence of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But every living person has a culture.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As long as you are alive and no longer a baby, you have a culture.</S>
