<p>Apart from the above points, we also need to use facts and experiences as references. Acts 15 shows that the brothers had a discussion (v. 7); this means that all the attendants had an equal right to speak. Today when the eighty-some elders of the church in Taipei come together, every elder has an equal right to speak. However, this kind of speaking should not be the same as in the worldly conferences in which quarrels and fights occur. We need to understand that even in our discussion, we need to follow the Spirit. When we follow the Spirit, our spirit will not desire to fight but will require us to be calm. There are no chairmen in our meetings; no one pounds a gavel and holds a sign to ask people to be quiet; rather, the Holy Spirit within us always pounds a small gavel and reminds us inwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Testimony of Peter</h2>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s speaking in Acts 15 was a testimony (vv. 7-11). Peter was in Jerusalem not long after being rebuked by Paul (Gal. 2:11-14). Peter was severely rebuked by Paul and fully put to shame. Humanly speaking, he did not seem to have the position to be an apostle; nevertheless, in Acts 15, at the conference in Jerusalem, he was full of courage. When everyone finished the discussion, Peter stood up to speak to the people. He said, &ldquo;Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe&rdquo; (v. 7). This is to read the facts, experiences, and present condition of the brothers and sisters; this was Peter&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Testimonies of Barnabas and Paul</h2>
<p>After Peter&rsquo;s speaking, Barnabas and Paul further strengthened his speaking with their testimonies. They related to the elders and apostles who were at the conference in Jerusalem the signs and wonders that God had done among the Gentiles through them (v. 12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making Decisions according to<br />
the Truth in God&rsquo;s Word</h2>
<h2 class="head3">James&rsquo;s Views Based upon the Truth</h2>
<p>After the brothers finished their testimonies, James decided the matter by offering his views based upon the truth in God&rsquo;s word. We can see that James spoke very well. His speaking was fully in tune with the testimony of Peter and also with that of Barnabas and Paul. He was fully in coordination with the brothers (vv. 13-21). However, we must also point out that James&rsquo;s decision was still very much under the influence of his Jewish background. The Scriptures he quoted were correct, but in the end he added something of Judaism by speaking of &ldquo;what is strangled and blood&rdquo; (v. 20). It was right that James spoke according to the truth, but he also added something of himself. Hence, we need to be careful not to add our own ideas to God&rsquo;s idea because of our background.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Decision of the Holy Spirit and<br />
the Apostles with the Elders</h2>
<p>Eventually, a resolution was formed in Acts 15, which was the decision of the Holy Spirit and the apostles with the elders; this is beautiful (vv. 22, 28-29). The apostles and elders had the revelation of the Bible and the instant revelation of the Holy Spirit according to the condition of the saints at that time. Then based on this they made a decision. Sadly, although the decision was correct, it was mixed with James&rsquo;s opinion. We absolutely believe that Paul was not satisfied with part of the decision, because it contradicted his concept in Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews. The matter of abstaining from blood and from that which is strangled belongs to Judaism and should not be added to the New Testament. May we all learn the lesson.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> </body></html>
