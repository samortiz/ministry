<p>We need to know who Jesus is today. The One on whom we call is the God of creation, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, the indwelling God, and the incorporated God. Today He is the Body-Christ. Christ is all-inclusive. Everything that God is and has accomplished, obtained, and attained as the God of creation, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, the indwelling God, and the incorporated God is included in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus today is the all-inclusive dose. Whatever we need is in His wonderful name. If we are in darkness, we only need to call on the name of Jesus for the morning star to shine within us (Rev. 22:16). When we feel lonely, we can say, &ldquo;Jesus, O Jesus.&rdquo; As a result, we will sense Someone accompanying us within (Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). If we lack wisdom, we only need to call on the Lord to receive Him as wisdom (1 Cor. 1:24). When we feel weak, we need to call on the Lord to be strengthened with Christ as power (v. 24). Whenever I need to share a message and do not know what to say, I pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! What are You speaking, Lord?&rdquo; When I pray in this way, I always receive a message. Jesus is my message; He is the living Word (Rom. 10:6-8). Jesus is every positive thing in the universe (Col. 2:16-17). We need to realize that today our Jesus is no longer the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God but the processed and incorporated God, who is all and in all (3:11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE BODY-CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Knit Together</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:2 says, &ldquo;That their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; Having our hearts knit together is a Body matter. We cannot enjoy Christ adequately until our heart is knit together with the hearts of all the saints. We can gain a little of Christ as individuals, but we can gain much more as the church. We need to come together as the church in a united, knit-together way, having our heart and mind knit together with all the saints. If the church decides to do something that we do not agree with, we should not be dissenting but should simply go along with the church. As a result, we will see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. If the church remains one, it will receive a great blessing. The Lord knows how to care for His Body, and we need to care for the oneness of His Body. We should never be dissenting against the church but should always be knit together with the church. If we are knit together with the church, we will have the full assurance of understanding and the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving and Walking in the Corporate Christ</h2>
<p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&rdquo; The One in whom we need to walk is the incorporated God. To receive Christ is to receive the Body-Christ, because Christ today is a corporate Body (1 Cor. 12:12). We need to receive this Christ.</p>
<p>Regrettably, however, many Christians today would say that they care only for Christ and not for the church. If we care only for Christ and not for the church, we can gain only a limited portion of Christ. We can gain much more of the riches of Christ when we care for both Christ and the church. Thus, we need to pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I care for You, and I care also for Your Body, because I know that You are the Head and that the church is the Body. I cannot have the Head without the Body.&rdquo; We should pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I know that today You are no longer only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ, the Head with the Body. You are the Body-Christ. Therefore, Lord Jesus, I receive You as well as Your Body. I receive the Body-Christ, and I desire to walk in this Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It makes a great difference in our Christian life to walk in the corporate Christ. Most Christians today have been robbed of the riches of Christ. Most are spiritually poor and weak simply because they care only for Christ and not for the church.</p>
<p>Many of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can testify that since the day we came into the church and began to care for the church, there has been a great difference in our spiritual life. We have the inner sense that we are rich. Everyone in the church is a spiritual billionaire; we are all rich.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
