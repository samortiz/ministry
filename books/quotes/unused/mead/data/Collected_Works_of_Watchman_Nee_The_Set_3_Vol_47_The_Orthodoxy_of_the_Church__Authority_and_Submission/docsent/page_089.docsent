   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT IS THE LORD'S BAPTISM?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the Lord's baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Clearly the baptism that the Lord referred to was not the baptism at the river Jordan, because that was over.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The baptism that the Lord was about to go through was forthcoming, referring to His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Luke 12:50 the Lord said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his book The Release of the Lord, Mr. Austin-Sparks said that this refers to the Lord's desire to release Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord was yearning to release Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word pressed means confined or constricted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ had a sanctified body in which all of God's riches were embodied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such glorious riches were bound by the flesh, and how constricted and confined He was!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How wonderful it would be if these riches would be released!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems as if He was saying that God's life was too confined and constricted within Him, and that it would be wonderful if it could be released.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, the cross was for redemption of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the other hand, it was for the release of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God released His life through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord desired that this life be released.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before crucifixion, however, such a life was constricted within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the basic and primary meaning of this baptism is the release of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Following this, the Lord said that once God's life was released, it would be kindled like fire on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What would be the result of this baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It would result in something like a fire, something that would bring in division rather than peace on earth v. 51 . Once a fire touches something, it burns.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From that time on, houses would be against houses, believers would be against unbelievers, those who have life would be against those who do not have life, and those with the fire would be against those without the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what it means to be baptized with the Lord's baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once life is released, let go, and unleashed, there will be division.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wherever this life goes, it will not bring peace, but strife.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some know the Lord and some do not know the Lord, and there will be strife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once life enters a house, there will be striving in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who have passed through this baptism are immediately separated from those who have not passed through it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord was saying, "I am going to the cross to release My life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will bring in strife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Can you handle this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you like this?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First there is death, and then there is the release of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result of this baptism is division.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Dead men cannot strive with one another; only those who have life can strive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord's word points to the fact that death operates in us and life operates in others 2 Cor 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord's baptism was the removal of the outward shell and the liberation of His life through death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is what we are doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must break the outward shell before the life within us can flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we were at Custom Lane Translator's note: In Foochow at the base of Kuling Mountain , I mentioned that life cannot be released unless the outward man is first broken.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our outward man has constricted His life and restricted it from flowing out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must realize that if the outward man is not broken, life cannot flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once a man's outward shell is broken, he becomes very approachable and life flows out easily.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Otherwise, life is bound; man's spirit is not released, and life does not flow freely.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is one thing to expound 2 Corinthians 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is altogether another thing to give others a touch of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many people think that this verse is merely a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let me repeat: Unless your outward man is broken, no life will flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once a man's outward shell is broken, he becomes very approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is like a grain of wheat that falls into the ground; the life within breaks forth from its shell and spontaneously grows out of the opening.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is what the Lord said in John 12:24: "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When a grain of wheat falls to the ground, the shell breaks, and the life is released.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Following this the Lord said, "He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant will be.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a man wants to save his "shell," he will not be able to release the life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once a man loses his "shell," he will bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are two aspects to the cross the aspect of redemption and the aspect of life-releasing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Mark 10:35-45 the Lord did not speak of His death; He only spoke of His baptism, because He did not want others to think that James and John could participate in His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The work of redemption can be accomplished only by Christ our High Priest; no one else can participate in it or do anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have no share in the Lord's death on the cross as far as redemption goes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But we do have a share in the release of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why the Lord only brought out the aspect of death that is related to His baptism when He spoke of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This death has to do with the release of His life; it has nothing to do with redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord said that He was going to go through a baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This meant that His outward shell would be broken and life would be released, like a grain of wheat breaking its shell and bearing much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For a person to be baptized with the Lord's baptism means for him to be broken and torn down before the Lord and for life to come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the outward man is not broken, it is very difficult for the Lord's life to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You may have life within you, but it cannot come out.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You may be sitting very close to another person, but the life within you cannot come out or touch him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The result of baptism is fire and division.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Once this life flows out, there is no peace on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Instead, there is division.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many people are divided by this life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is a big chasm between those who follow the Lord and those who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is also a big difference between those who belong to the Lord and those who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Once a man touches the life of Christ, he takes a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is much contention between those who have the Lord and those who do not, those who know God and those who do not, those who pay the price and those who do not, those who are faithful and those who are not, and those who accept the trials and those who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord seemed to be saying, "Are you willing to bear the consequence of taking My baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You want to be on My right and left; you want to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But are you willing to bear the consequence of taking My baptism and becoming different from other children of God today?"</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In order to sit at the Lord's right and left and to have a place of glory, we have to drink His cup and be baptized with His baptism, which means that we have to acknowledge God's will above everything, to break the outward shell, and to release life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Only such ones know what it is to sit at the right and left of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the Christian pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord's word to James and John, in effect, was, "You must first drink My cup and pass through My baptism before you can sit on My right and left in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Can you drink this cup and be baptized with this baptism?"</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They answered, "We are able" 10:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The two inquired of the Lord, but they did not know how serious their request was.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They were not the only ones; all descendants of Adam are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Lord spelled out the conditions, and they said that they were able.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord told them the fact, that to sit on His right and left required that they drink His cup and be baptized with His baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But even in saying this, He did not promise them His right and left side.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>What He meant was that if a man does not drink His cup and is not baptized with His baptism, he will surely not be able to sit on His right or left.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But even if they drank His cup and passed through His baptism, they still might not sit on His right or left, because the latter depends on God's preparation v. 40 . If a man does not drink the Lord's cup and is not baptized with His baptism, he will surely not be able to sit on His right or left side.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But even if he drinks His cup and is baptized with His baptism, he may still not be able to sit on His right or left side.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Those who do not drink the Lord's cup and are not baptized with His baptism will surely not sit on His right or left.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But those who drink His cup and are baptized with His baptism may not necessarily sit on His right or left.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Perhaps James and John would ask, "What then can we say?"</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If one does not drink the cup and take the baptism, he is disqualified for sure.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>And if one drinks the cup and takes the baptism, he may be qualified, but it still depends on God's preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>James and John could be off the mark in their request, but the Lord could not be inaccurate in His answer.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If the Lord gave the right and left places to James and John, these two seats would have been gone for the past two thousand years of church history.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Other seats might still be available, but these two seats would have been taken over by these two; they would have become reserved seats for the two disciples, and others would have been discouraged to go on in the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Lord did not grant their request, and the two seats are still available.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Some among us may still have a chance to take those two seats.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Therefore, this lesson is still applicable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But the main point of this passage is not in the preceding discussion but in what follows.</S>
