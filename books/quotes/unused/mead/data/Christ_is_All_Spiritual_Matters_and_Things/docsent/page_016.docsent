   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO KINDS OF CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among God s children, there are two kinds of Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One kind is filled with things, and the other kind is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Outwardly, both kinds look equally good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One cannot detect much of a difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One talks about humility; the other also talks about humility.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One talks about meekness, and the other also talks about meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One talks about love, and the other also talks about love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One talks about forgiveness, and the other also talks about forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Outwardly, both are more or less the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They appear to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But with one, we just have a list of things, while with the other, we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In reality, the two are entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>WITH CHRIST, THERE BEING THE NEED OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would like to point out that when we have things, we do not need the cross anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With Christ, there is the need of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The cross restricts us not only from sin, but from our own activity as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The cross not only tells us that we should not sin, but forbids us from our own activities.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problem with God s children is that they think everything is fine as long as they do something well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have not seen that the good things are only things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God cares for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the very good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If He does not move, we cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is easy for us to say many comforting words to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if He has not said them, we should not, because once we do, we will touch death; we will be inwardly weakened and deflated, and we will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can help others in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can be very gentle, and others may consider us nice men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when we act this way, something within us collapses, and we become weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here we see the need of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The many things we gain through good works do not require the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we allow the Lord to live in us to be our everything, and when He becomes our things, we need the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When He does not move, we cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to ask the Lord to deliver us from good and righteous acts as much as we ask Him to deliver us from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is easy for us to ask God to deliver us from sins, because we have condemned sins already.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But it is not easy to be delivered from the natural life, because many of us have not condemned the natural life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have not seen the natural life, and we have not rejected it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>CHRIST BEING THE HEALING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What does it mean for Christ to be our matters and things?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is the significance of having Christ as our matters and things?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I think we can draw a good analogy from our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people are very weak physically.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They ask God to heal them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We find three kinds of results or three kinds of faith in this asking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some people believe that God is their Healer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Others believe that God will give them health and heal them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But a third group believes that God is their healing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How does a person pray when he has an illness?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What does he seek after?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He expects God to be his Healer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is living, and he wants God to be his Healer, to touch him with His power, to be his Physician and demonstrate His healing power and healing ability.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If this is the case, his God is as far from him as his doctor is from him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I wonder if you have heard what I said.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a crucial word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many people want God to be their Healer, but the distance between God and such people is as great as the distance between them and their earthly doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Other people are a little bit better.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They want God to heal them and give them health.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then one day God heals them, and they recover.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many people pray, make supplications, and expect healings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But why are they continually weak?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are still many weak ones among us today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many people expect God to be their Healer or to heal them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But having God as the Healer and being healed are outward experiences; they are merely things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is the result of these experiences?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many times God is willing to heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am not saying that God will not heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God can deal with little children this way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But many times, He will not deal with us this way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we first believed in the Lord, God might have been willing to be our Healer, and He might have been willing to heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But after we have believed in Him for a while, He will put us in His hands, and He will educate us and teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then God will no longer be our healer and will no longer heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God reserves the best for those whom He considers the best; He becomes healing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He does not give them healing, but becomes healing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He does not become the healing God to them; He becomes the living God who is healing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God is our healing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I do not know how to put this in any better way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I can only say this most reverently before the Lord, that Christ is our healing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The trouble is that many people only see healing as a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They think that this is something apart from Christ and that everything is over after He has performed the healing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You may remember the story of the woman who touched Christ and how He felt the power go out from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Bible says that He perceived that power had gone out from Him Luke 8:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I take the liberty to make this word more plain by saying that Christ Himself went out.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He was not performing a healing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Rather, He was the healing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When He became the healing, men were healed.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We often may be weak and may still have physical ailments.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But we can lift up our head and say to the Lord, Lord, I do not expect You to be my Healer, only to go away after my sickness is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I do not expect You to heal me, and then find You gone even though the healing remains.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Lord, I expect You to be my healing.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is true that You are my Healer, but I want You to be the Healer in me.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is true that You are my healing, but I want my healing to be something personified.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>My healing should be a person; it should be something personified.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is a person who becomes my health.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God becomes my health.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Christ becomes my health.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Is there a difference between being healed and knowing Christ as my healing?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The difference is great!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When I learned this lesson, I found that I not only possessed something called healing, but I possessed a person who has become life to my body.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Once I saw this, all problems were solved, and I saw that my body has much to do with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When I have a problem with the Lord, my body immediately has a problem with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If He wants to put us through His test or do anything else to us, there is nothing that we can do to resist Him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Everything that we have depends on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We can only look to Him; we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This is absolutely different from making healing a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I thank the Lord for healing me many times.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I can say that I was sick on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year, and God healed me on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I can tell you many stories about how I was healed at a certain hour of a certain day in a certain month and a certain year.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I can count many cases of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But those healings were small healings.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>They were isolated things, and they can be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Whether there is one case, two cases, ten cases, or twenty cases, they can be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>But I can also tell you another story, that at a certain hour of a certain day in a certain month and certain year, God opened my eyes to see that Christ is my healing.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This is something that cannot be repeated; it is something that cannot be quantified.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Once is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It is not a thing that can be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It is a person, a personified healing.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>My healing is a person who is in me as my healing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Praise the Lord that this is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Having God heal me and having Him as my healing are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>One is a thing; the other is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Paul was not healed, but he received the healing.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Can we see the difference between these two?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Paul showed in 2 Corinthians 12 that he was not healed v. 9 . He did not receive the thing which we call healing.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>But with Paul, we see One who was his healing continually.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>His weakness remained with him, but his healing also remained with him.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>His weakness was chronic, but his healing was abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>What is a healing?</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>To us, a healing is the removal of something.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>No, healing is not a removal; healing is acquiring something.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Healing is not the removal of weakness but the presence of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>When I first saw this matter, the light came very slowly because my mind was filled with things; everything around me was a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>I did not realize that the Lord wanted to be my thing, and I did not know that healing was not a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>I only knew that the Lord promised me something; I did not know that the Lord wanted to be my healing.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I only knew about the Lord s promise; I did not know about the Lord as my healing.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>One day I read Paul s story in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>It was very strange to me.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>It would have been an easy thing for the Lord to grant him the healing.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Removing the thorn was as easy for the Lord as a doctor removing germs.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>But why did the Lord not heal Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>I prayed about this, and while I was praying, the Lord showed me one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>In 1923 Brother Weigh invited me to preach at a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>In order to get there, I had to take a little boat along the Min River.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>The boats often became stuck to the riverbed because the water was too shallow and the rocks were big.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>The boat owner often had to tug the boat along.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>While I was praying, this scene suddenly appeared in my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>I said, God, it would be easy for You to remove the rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Would it not be wonderful if You removed the rocks, and the boat floated on the water instead?</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>I read 2 Corinthians 12 and realized that this was exactly how Paul prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>The water was too shallow, and the rocks were exposed conspicuously; Paul prayed that God would remove the rocks so that he could sail on the water once again.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>But God answered by saying that He would not remove the rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Instead, He caused the water level to rise.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>When the water rises, the boat can pass over the rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>This is what God is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Our problem and our prayer are that we are only for a thing healing.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>But His answer is for Him to be our healing.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>When He is present, we can glide over our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Paul s weakness was still there; he did not use his own strength to fight it.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>If he fought with his own strength, he could only say that his own strength had tabernacled over him.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>But it was the power of Christ which tabernacled over him v. 9 . It was God who was working.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>There is a basic difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>One is God giving me a thing, and the other is God Himself becoming my thing.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>God in me becomes the thing that I need.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>God Himself is that very thing.</S>
