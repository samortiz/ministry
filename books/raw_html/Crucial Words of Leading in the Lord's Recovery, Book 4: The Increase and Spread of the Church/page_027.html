	 <h2 class="head3">Remaining Steadfastly<br />
in the Fellowship of the Apostles</h2>
<p>Second, a small group must hold fast to the fellowship of the apostles. First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The fellowship of the apostles is their fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. The New Testament believers also have fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. This fellowship was brought in by the apostles; hence, this fellowship is a fellowship of the Body of Christ. Like the teaching of the apostles, the fellowship of the apostles is uniquely one in the universe. We cannot have another fellowship outside the fellowship of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Even though there are many benefits in forming a small group, there is also the potential problem of opening a door. If we are not cautious, many different teachings can come in once a door is open. A different teaching will produce a clique. For example, if some teach concerning speaking in tongues, some will receive it, and a clique will be formed by those who teach and those who receive. We cannot have a small circle of fellowship inside the universal fellowship; neither can we have a small fellowship outside the fellowship of the apostles. In other words, we cannot have a fellowship that is apart from the fellowship of the church. A small fellowship is always the basis of a sect.</p>
<p>Before the nineteenth century no one saw this light, but when the Brethren were raised up in England, they saw the light and released it. From that time onward, the words in Acts 2:42 have been clear. The three thousand who were saved all remained steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles; they did not depart from the teaching and the fellowship. The teaching and the fellowship of the apostles are still with the church today. A person with a dissenting idea, who leads others astray and forms them into a small circle of fellowship, is not remaining steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles. They have left the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Breaking of Bread and the Prayers</h2>
<p>Third, a small group needs the breaking of bread. The breaking of bread is for the remembrance of the Lord. At the Lord&rsquo;s table, on the one hand, we enjoy the Lord, and on the other hand, we offer up our adoration to Him. We love Him and honor Him. The Chinese speak of &ldquo;reverence and love,&rdquo; but reverence before love is religious, whereas loving and honoring are experiential. When we are saturated with God&rsquo;s love, there is a response in us of love toward Him, and then out of this love, honor and respect come forth. Fourth, a small group should pray, petitioning the Lord related to the needs of the saints and the church and for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Preaching the Gospel and Teaching the Truth</h2>
<p>Fifth, a small group must preach the gospel. We should preach the gospel beginning with our family, then to our friends and neighbors, and then to all those whom we know.</p>
<p>Sixth, a small group must teach the truth. Paul lived in Ephesus for three years, and he not only taught the saints publicly but also from house to house. The phrase <em>from house to house</em> is mentioned in Acts 2:46; 5:42; and 20:20. This term in Greek means &ldquo;from one house to another house.&rdquo; Paul taught publicly and from house to house; his gatherings from house to house were small group gatherings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, when we study the Bible, we can see that the way to have a small group involves six items: speaking according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching, living in the unique fellowship of the apostles, breaking bread to enjoy the Lord with both love and honor, praying to meet the needs of the saints and the church and for His will to be done, preaching the gospel, and learning the truth and teaching the truth for the edification of others.</p>
