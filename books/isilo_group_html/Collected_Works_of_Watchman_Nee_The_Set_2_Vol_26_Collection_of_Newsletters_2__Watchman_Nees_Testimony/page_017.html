May the Lord keep you as He keeps us. The situation in northern Kiangsu is not very peaceful (because there are bandits causing trouble everywhere). The hearts of the people are fearful and worried, so in our locality (Su Chia Tsui) we have a meeting every afternoon to pray for this situation. Last night while we were sleeping, we suddenly heard rapid gunfire at about 2:00 in the morning. There were twenty or thirty bandits who stormed the streets firing their guns and breaking down doors. They were very fierce. (At that time we could only pray quietly before God.) The police and militia in our town could not hold them off, so the bandits plundered from door to door. When they left, they took thirty to forty women, old folk, and children with them. When the dawn broke, they went to the northeast. Thank the Lord, He preserved us in this situation and answered our prayer. None of the houses of the believing brothers and sisters in this town met with danger. All were blessed by the Lord with peace. Please do not worry. We thank Him a thousand times, even ten thousand times. May the grace of the Lord be constantly with us all. Amen.</p><p>From,<br />the church in Su Chia Tsui, northern Kiangsu</p><p>(Note from Watchman: There is no denomination in Su Chia Tsui, so they can call themselves the church in Su Chia Tsui. Localities with denominations cannot do this.)</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM BROTHER WANG K'AI SEN</h2><p>(See the answer to this letter in the preceding issue)</p><p>Peace in the Lord to Mr. Watchman:</p><p>Last year the Lord gave me a special opportunity to meet you and talk at length with you. I really gained a great benefit from it. I have already told you something of the situation at Li gospel hall. I think you still remember. You exhorted me to bear the responsibility to deal with them and openly discuss their most important errors. After I left I told Brother Chang Chia Chi about your exhortation in detail. The two of us specifically prayed in one accord for this matter and asked for God's leading. If it was according to God's will, we were going to leave the gospel hall. We wanted to obey no matter what the cost. I recently learned from a Western brother the results of your work in England last year. He said that a new doctrine had been discovered which caused many churches in England to divide. He said that this doctrine had already spread to the gospel hall in Singapore. He told us to guard against it watchfully. He also said that the doctrines you preached in England had already been published in English. We were very happy. Praise the Lord for His victory. But the Western brothers in Singapore already knew that our faith was not the same as theirs, so they paid careful attention to the messages we preached in the gospel hall. Three weeks ago, they made an appointment with Brother Chang and myself to have an open discussion with them. They said that Brother Chang's preaching about unwatchful Christians being punished and thrown into a place in the outer darkness to weep and gnash their teeth was a false doctrine. They said that Matthew 24 and 25 both refer to the Jews and have nothing to do with the believers. They said we were the children of God, not His servants. They said this preaching nullified the accomplishment of the cross and would cause the brothers in the gospel hall to stumble. Then they quoted Romans 8:1, saying that a believer would never be condemned again. Although I refuted them with some questions, they answered wildly according to their own will. We did not want to argue with them and could only prepare to withdraw from them. We have now stopped meeting at the gospel hall, but we have not clearly stated the reason we cannot join with them again. I am writing this letter so that you will know what has happened. You thoroughly know the content of the Brethren Church. Please tell us the details of the evidence that proves they are a denomination so that the next time we meet with them for an open discussion, we will be able to deal with and prove their many errors. Then we will be finished with this matter, and our hearts will have peace. This is a very important matter. It is best if you could spare some time to answer this letter no matter how busy you are with your work for the Lord. I am waiting for your answer. May you have peace that surpasses understanding. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord in Shanghai.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Wang K'ai Sen<br />April 24, 1934</p><p>Please ask them to remember to pray for us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 26: Collection of Newsletters (2) & Watchman Nee's Testimony &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
