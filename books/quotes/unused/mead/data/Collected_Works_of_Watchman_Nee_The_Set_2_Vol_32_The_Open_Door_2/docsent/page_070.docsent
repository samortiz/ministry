   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that you have arrived in Shanghai by now.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A few days ago Sister Bao Hsu-min wrote and expressed her desire to go to Shanghai for some edification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This stirred up my desire to go to Shanghai.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fukien Province</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A few weeks ago the co-workers sent you X dollars from Chuenchow to be used for relief to brothers in need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I wonder whether you have received it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have received it Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The regions along the coast in Fukien province have witnessed the clear working of the Holy Spirit during the past year.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if we work, everything is futile if we do not accomplish God's most excellent will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason we desire very much that you come and help us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have written and mentioned the work in Dong-Yuen.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Glory to His name!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers Chen Ke-san, Chai Tse-chung, October 27</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A Letter from Brother Chang Kwang-rong, Chekiang Province</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After the meetings in Shi-Si in Tai-Shun, I went with Brother David to Ju-Si.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He received a special commission from the Lord the next day and left to go to Tsen-Shia-Kwan.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everywhere I go we will have a few days of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have been taught and am now clear that the ministry God has assigned to me is not to gather many people and conduct big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, it is to visit small places and to have home meetings every evening according to the condition of each place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Drawing near to the Lord, studying the Word, and mutually asking and answering questions in this way gives everyone a chance to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From my experience, this affords the Spirit more freedom to work in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is what I am doing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May the Lord make me faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, January 31</S>
