   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Compound Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The compound Spirit compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power is the anointing ointment to sanctify all the people, matters, and things in the service of God Exo 30:23-28; 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The complete God and the perfect Man are in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ's death with its effectiveness and His resurrection with its power are also in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we have this Spirit, all of these ingredients become our bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>C. The All-inclusive Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>as the Spirit of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Philippians 1:19-21 reveals the all-inclusive Spirit as the Spirit of Jesus Christ with His bountiful supply through which the believers live Christ and magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>D. The Lord Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second Corinthians 3:18 refers to the Lord Spirit, which indicates that Christ the Lord is the Spirit from whom the believers are transformed into Christ's image of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Spirit is a compound divine title like the Father God and the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the Lord is the Spirit v. 17 . There are a number of people in today's Christianity who do not recognize this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate persons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible, however, reveals that the three of the Divine Trinity are distinct but can never be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>E. The Sevenfold Intensified Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Revelation we see the sevenfold intensified Spirit for the believers to overcome all the negative things in the degradation of the church 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The above items A to E concerning the Spirit indicate strongly that the book of James falls far behind the highest revelation concerning the Spirit of God revealed to Paul and John in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to realize that many Christians today are, in principle, like James.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>James was a pious person fearing and worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What he wrote was very good ethically, helping the people who fear God to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But James was devoid of the visions of God's high revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today many in Christianity are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They teach the right things concerning God, yet they are devoid of the higher vision of God's high revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They preach and teach that God is unique and that He created the heavens, the earth, and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He also created man, but man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, because God loved man, He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jesus came and lived on this earth as recorded in the four Gospels to show God's love, God's kindness, and God's goodness to people, healing them and doing miracles to rescue them for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then He went to the cross and died for man's sins to be man's Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He resurrected to show His power that death could not bind Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then He ascended to the heavens to be glorified, crowned, and enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Finally, He sent His believers into all the earth to preach Him, which is to establish the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, there is nothing wrong with this teaching, which they call the fundamental teaching.</S>
