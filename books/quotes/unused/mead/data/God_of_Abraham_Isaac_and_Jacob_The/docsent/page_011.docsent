   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"In Thee Shall All</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Families of the Earth Be Blessed"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God also said to Abraham, "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed" Gen 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows that God has not forgotten the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God does not bless the nations of the earth directly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, He blesses them through Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God chose one man, and this one man became a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From this man there was a family, and from that family a nation, and from that nation all the families of the earth are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God does not bless the nations directly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, He worked on one man first, and through this one man all the nations of the earth are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God fully deposited His grace, power, and authority into this one man, and then through this one man dispensed all these things to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the principle of Abraham's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This principle continues until today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the most important issue for God is the choosing of His vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Indeed, those who are chosen as vessels should know Him!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether or not the families of the earth would be blessed depended fully on Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, God's eternal purpose and His plan are joined to the men He has chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The standing or failure of God's chosen men determines the success or failure of God's purpose and plan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why Abraham had to go through so many experiences and had to receive so much from God before he could dispense what he had received to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is no wonder that Abraham had to go through so many trials and encounter so many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was the only way that others could receive help and benefit from him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham knew God; therefore, he is the father of those who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who are of faith are the sons of Abraham Gal 3:7 ; they are begotten of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We know that all spiritual works are based on the principle of begetting, not on the principle of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sons are begotten; they do not come about through preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's way of recovery requires man to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only those who believe will be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What did God do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First He brought one man to the point of believing so that he would be a believer; from this believer many more believers were begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to remember that it is useless to preach without begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That kind of preaching will only make men understand doctrines, and the doctrines will pass from one mouth to another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After they circle the earth and come back to the speaker, they will still be nothing more than doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What good will it do for a man to zealously preach the doctrine of salvation if he himself does not know God and is not begotten of God?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if a man is not merely preaching the doctrine of salvation with his mouth, but is testifying of his salvation and how he has met God, others will touch something real.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only this kind of person will beget others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's principle of work is to do something in one person first and then beget others through him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's work is living, and when He sows the living seed into a person, the seed will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul told the Corinthians, "It is not to shame you that I write these things but to admonish you as my beloved children...for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel" 1 Cor 4:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Begetting is a great principle in spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The principle of spiritual work is one of begetting, not of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May God open our eyes to see the vanity of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is useless to preach something to others without having that thing ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have the seed, we have the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without the seed there cannot be growth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's work is related to life; it is not an empty doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once you pass through a certain pathway ordained by God, you will have the ability to beget.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, nothing will avail.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to bless all the families of the earth, God first had to work on Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to have a group of believers, God first had to gain one believer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Abraham was the first one who believed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then many more believers were begotten through him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the families of the earth are blessed not through a sermon they hear, but through a life they receive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God worked on Abraham first, and then through him expanded His work to many people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One day when the city which Abraham eagerly waited for descends, the city whose Architect and Builder is God Heb 11:10 , all the families of the earth will be fully blessed, and God's eternal plan will be fully consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's work of redemption began at the time of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God worked in Abraham in order to make him a vessel, and this was not for Abraham alone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through Abraham God reached others.</S>
