   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD IS WILLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most people in this world do not like to be misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes good intentions can be misunderstood as bad intentions, or love can be misunderstood as hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many undesirable things in this world, and being misunderstood is certainly one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the most misunderstood One in the whole world is God!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The misunderstanding we experience is only a fraction of what God experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the most misunderstood One in the whole world!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once I met a relative of mine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He had a Ph.D. and was a professor at Manchuria University.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I exhorted him to believe in the Lord Jesus at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said, "Your God is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your God does nothing good in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From heaven He records the evil deeds of this person and that person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He does it like bookkeeping, and He uses this book to judge and condemn people to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your God does not have a good heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All He does in heaven is record the evil deeds of all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His heart is very devious, and He wishes men to go to hell."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Oh, he misunderstood God!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He misunderstood God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may think, "God hates me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He does not want me to be saved; He is anxiously waiting to condemn me and bring me to perdition; He wants me to go to hell."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, I must tell you today that I know my God!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My message today is to tell you one thing; if you really understand the message, you will not give up this God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now I beg you to listen to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world"!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please pay attention: God is love!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is so wonderful that God is not only thinking about you, caring for you, paying attention to you, and being merciful to you, He also loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A few days ago I was strolling in a park and met a classmate of mine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I asked him to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I continually exhorted him, but he would not accept.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the end I almost burst into tears.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If he only knew how loving God is toward him!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Men very easily misunderstand God's love!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You might think, "What kind of God is this God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Does He want to save me?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Can He save a person like me?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Men are always full of doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But God not only is merciful toward you, He not only cares for you and pays attention to you, He also loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Throughout the ages, the most difficult thing God has done is love men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After man sinned, the first thing God did was love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is full of good intention toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is anxious for men to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may think that He is fierce and vicious and that He likes to see you far away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But God gave us this book, the Bible, the Word of God, which tells us that God is love!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even though you are a sinner, God loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even though you are far away from God, He loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Time after time, God sent His servants to tell men about His intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said, "Can a woman forget her nursing child, / That she would not have compassion on the son of her womb?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>/ Even though they may forget, / Yet I will not forget you" Isa 49:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Oh, He so loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He once used a good illustration: "If a man divorces his wife / And she goes from him / And becomes another man's wife, / Will he return to her again?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>/ Will not that land be / Utterly polluted?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But you have committed fornication with many lovers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>/ Yet return to Me" Jer 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Oh, God is so willing to accept sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But men do not believe that God loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They always doubt that God can be so nice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But I have to say that God is love!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God so loved the world that He decided that He Himself would come to the earth and become flesh in order to show men His love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once I went to Lushan Mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I like the flowers and birds on that mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I do not like to place birds in cages; I like to see them flying freely.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One day the birds came and ate up all the rice I left on the railing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This was very interesting, and I went and got a whole bowl of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As soon as I walked close to them, the birds flew away; after I left, they all flew back.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I had no intention to catch them or hurt them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I was more than happy for them to come and eat my rice.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I thought it would be the happiest thing for me to sit in the midst of the birds while they surrounded me on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But they did not know my heart, and they always avoided me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If I wanted the birds to know my heart, the only way was for me to speak their language or become a bird flying among them and telling them my intention.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then I would not be misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But there was no way that I could become a bird; consequently, there was no way for me to show my heart to them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the same way God feels about us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God loves us; He likes us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He wants us to be close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But we do not understand His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God's Word tells us that God has spoken of old in many portions and in many ways through His servants concerning His heart's desire and that He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But man did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, God had to personally come to this world and become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This man is Jesus, the Christ, whom we know.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If I became a bird, you might say that I humiliated myself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But for God to become a man is more of a humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What humility that the God of glory would lower Himself to become a man!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He is far above all, but He emptied Himself, took the form of man, and came in the likeness of men.</S>
