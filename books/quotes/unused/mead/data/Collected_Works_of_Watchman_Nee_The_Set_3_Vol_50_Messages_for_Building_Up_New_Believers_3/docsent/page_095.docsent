   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Woman Beginning to Teach</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 13:33 says, "The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This woman is Roman Catholicism, the degraded church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She began to exercise her self-assumed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many sisters cannot understand why the Bible forbids a woman to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because the Bible forbids the church to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In typology the church has no authority to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The principle of forbidding the woman to teach shows us that the church has no authority to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here the woman began to put leaven into the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that the woman began to exercise her authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, the church began to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Roman Catholic Church tells men that the Bible is God's Word, yet it also says that the church can speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, the church that it refers to is the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Roman Catholic Church has become very powerful and has brought many things into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you argue that the Bible does not say anything about the practices of the church, the Roman Catholic Church will tell you that it decides the way things should be.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you say that there are no idols according to the Bible, it will say that the pope has sanctioned the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may say that there is no such thing as the worship of Mary in the Bible, but it will say that the church believes that Mary should be worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The woman has assumed the role of teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thyatira, which in God's eyes is Roman Catholicism, tolerates Jezebel, a prophetess.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This woman brought adultery into the church, and she brought idolatry into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The symbol of the woman means that the church rather than the Lord is now making all the decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is Jezebel, the prophetess, who is teaching, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It would have been better for the church if it had received its teaching from the Head instead of assuming the role of teacher for itself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the church assumes this role, it results in all kinds of heresies being introduced into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is what the Lord means when He says that the kingdom of the heavens is like a woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. Leaven in Three Measures of Meal 1.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Leaven Being Wrong Doctrines,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Which Are Easy to Take</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Leaven refers to wrong doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus spoke about the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of the Sadducees.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Mark 8:15 there was the leaven of Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, leaven in the Bible refers to wrong doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is quite clear that the fine flour in Leviticus 2:1 refers to the food of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In particular it refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Word of God shows us that the Lord Jesus is the fine flour, which is the food God gave to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Leaven is not allowed in this food.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God commanded the people of Israel to eat unleavened bread when they came out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, putting leaven into fine flour spoils the Lord Jesus as our food!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Originally, there was fine flour, but now leaven has been added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What happens when leaven is added to fine flour?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without leaven, bread is coarse, tasteless, hard, heavy, and difficult to digest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With leaven, bread becomes light and easy to digest.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Leaven makes the flour tasty and easy to digest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many people feel that it is too hard to accept the Lord Jesus and His teachings; they find it hard to digest these things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who study the types of the Old Testament know clearly that fine flour refers to the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some feel that such a life is too weighty, hard, and solid; they cannot take it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The woman in the parable introduces many heresies into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She leavens the fine flour, making it easier for many to accept the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the world and every kind of heresy and doctrine are brought into the church, it is easier for someone to accept the Lord Jesus and His teachings!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is what Roman Catholicism has done.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Heresy of Confusion</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the truth concerning the church, the works mentioned above constitute a great mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The world is mixed with the church, grace is mixed with the law, and believers are mixed with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The result is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, righteousness is mixed with mercy, paganism with Christianity, and religion with politics.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is no greater confusion and fornication than that which is seen in Roman Catholicism!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It mixes Christianity with Judaism and Grecian art with the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It brings in every conceivable thing from the world!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The birds of heaven have come in. Leaven has been put into the meal, and it has become leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now it is light and puffy, and everyone can accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A person can be a Catholic as long as he is baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If he sins, he can buy an indulgence, which will deliver him from the sins of this life as well as the future purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All kinds of heresies have come in!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a result, the meal is now leavened, and men can easily accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Roman Catholicism does not ask men to take the leaven; it only asks men to take the fine flour which contains the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Roman Catholicism gives us heresies as well as truths.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It believes that Christ is the Son of God and that the Lord Jesus died on the cross to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These two basic tenets of faith are there, but the fine flour has been leavened.</S>
