<h1 class="title">THE GOAL OF<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT LEADING&mdash;<br />
THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You from the depth of our being. These days are for Your move. Have mercy on us and grant us the grace that we may be able to match You in Your move. Give us a genuine burden and much prayer so that we may cooperate with Your move. Lord, by Your grace we are willing to consecrate ourselves afresh to You, as a living sacrifice, a burnt offering, to satisfy Your heart&rsquo;s desire. We would like to pave the way for You to advance and expand Your kingdom.</p>
<p>Lord, speak in our midst, operate among us, and even more, walk in our midst. Touch each of us in our inward being so that we would be willing to let You have the first place, to exalt You, and to let You possess us completely so that we can be a people on the earth who glorify You and live in Your glory. Lord, give us the utterance to release Your word and to speak forth Your heart&rsquo;s desire. We pray that by Your Spirit of grace You would transmit Your will, heart, thoughts, and even feeling into each of us so that we would have the same heart and the same mind and that we would testify that we have been joined to You as one spirit. In this one spirit we move and act. In this one spirit we meet and are being built together to serve in coordination.</p>
<p>By Your victorious name we crush the enemy under our feet. The church is victorious. The church is seated together with the Head on the throne. The church has the authority. Lord, rebuke Your enemy. You are the One who goes forth conquering and to conquer. Lead Your church forward in victory to propagate Your work and to cause Your recovery to spread over the entire island of Taiwan until the whole island is gospelized, truthized, and even churchized. Lord, cover us. We look to You, we lean on You, and we hide in Your shadow. Teach us to be hidden in You and to be one spirit with You. Lord, we are one with You. Glorify Your own name. Amen.</p>
<p>Under the Lord&rsquo;s leading, we will fellowship concerning increasing and spreading. We would like to see how a church as large as the church in Taipei should increase and spread. We need to rely on the Lord&rsquo;s grace while we take care of the following matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ESTABLISHING SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>The first matter is to establish small groups. This might not seem important, but it is a basic matter. The foundation of a church lies in its small groups. Whether we can keep those whom we lead to salvation depends on the small groups. We thank the Lord that we have already begun the small groups, but in order to maintain them, there are still several needs to be met. We need to study how the small groups can move forward and gain an increase. We also need to study the way to lead the saints to enter into the truth, to develop their functions, to shepherd others, and to restore the saints who have not been meeting. In addition, we should encourage all the saints to open their homes to preach the gospel to their &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; that is, their relatives, friends, and neighbors. Then they should spread outward.</p>
<p>The Lord desires us to be His witnesses, beginning from Jerusalem, then through all Judea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8). Our Jerusalem is our relatives, friends, and neighbors. We all should have a good number of relatives, friends, and neighbors who are not yet saved. Some of them may have only heard of the name of Jesus. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish&rdquo; (Rom. 1:14). We should have the feeling that we are indebted to our relatives, friends, and neighbors for the gospel.</p>
<p>In Acts 10 Cornelius received instruction from a holy angel to invite Peter to his home (v. 22). Cornelius sent his servants to Joppa to find Peter, and Cornelius also invited his relatives and intimate friends to his home (v. 24). Peter did not need to call a gathering when he arrived. This is a good pattern of preaching the gospel in the home. We hope that every saint&rsquo;s home can become a house of Cornelius. However, this depends on the small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECONSIDERING ADMINISTRATING<br />
AND PROMOTING THE WORK IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We have spent much time to reconsider the way to administrate and promote the work in the church in Taipei. There are only ten elders in Taipei who are responsible for administration, shepherding, and leading the twenty-one meeting halls. This is a huge and difficult task. In the twenty-one meeting halls there are six to seven thousand saints who regularly attend the meetings, but there are twenty thousand saints on the list. In a church with six thousand saints who have a heart to love and pursue the Lord and who meet, serve, and worship the Lord in twenty-one meeting halls, ten elders are not sufficient to administrate and promote the work in a thorough way. This is a heavy burden.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we must keep the principle in the Bible. No matter how many saints there are in a church, it is still one church; it cannot be divided into several churches. The first church raised up in the New Testament was the church in Jerusalem. On the day of Pentecost three thousand were saved in Jerusalem (2:41), and a few days later five thousand were saved, not including women (4:4). Without a doubt the number in the church in Jerusalem exceeded ten thousand within a short period of time (5:14). These ten thousand met &ldquo;from house to house&rdquo; (2:46; 5:42), but there were not many churches in Jerusalem. Therefore, when the church in Jerusalem is mentioned in Acts 8:1, the word church is singular. It was one church, not many churches. Even though there were many saints meeting in many houses, the believers did not have the flavor of division or separation. They were one church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
