Thank the Lord that He has given me the necessary strength. The meeting here is under God's grace. The sisters are living and fresh, and the brothers are improving. A few brothers who were cold are now warmed up, and a few who were hardened are now softened by the Lord's love. We are waiting for a great revival. Brother Yu Cheng-hwa is burdened to finish the translation of the autobiography of Madam Guyon so that it can be printed. Brother Chang Kwang-rong is in Shanghai. He loves the Lord very much. The Lord willing, he and I will leave Shanghai in the near future to visit brothers and sisters elsewhere.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Shou-ling<br />June 1</p><h2 class="head2">Compilation of Calendar with Daily Bible Reading</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Since I returned to Shanghai, my health has not been good; I have had two episodes of malaria attacks. The doctor examined my lungs and said that I have chronic pleurisy. Because there was no suitable place to rest at home, I stayed in the hospital for eight days. The doctor only gave me some tonic food supplements for my pleurisy and something to help me sleep. Humanly speaking, this is a chronic illness. I do not know what God's will is. May the Lord be gracious to me so that I do not become loose or lazy and so that I know what to do on my bed. Please pray for me. For a few months I have been burdened in my heart to compile a daily reading that contains a verse from the Scriptures and some words of exposition, which can be attached to a calendar. I have made some preparations, but I realize that this is not an easy task. I hope that some brothers and sisters will have the burden to write something, and I will compile them together. There is no limit to the number of words; it can be three or four hundred words. After we have decided on the content, we will do the editing. If the writings are too long, we can print only the verses on the calendar and put the exposition in another book. Do you think that this is a good idea? May the Lord grant the brothers and sisters the burden, and please put the matter in your prayer.</p><p>Brother Chou Shing-yi<br />May 26</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>A calendar with daily readings would surely be beneficial to the believers, but I do not know what Brother Chou's emphasis is. I will only say a few things for his consideration.</p><p>(1) Rather than saying that you have a verse and an exposition, it is probably better to say that you have a verse and a little portion. The little portion can be a testimony, a story, a parable, or some words of comfort, encouragement, exhortation, and remembrance for the purpose of stirring up zeal or love or for the building up of faith or godliness. Even if it is some kind of exposition, it should be for the nourishment of life and should be something that can be put into practice. Even if it does mention a subject like the rapture or the kingdom, its emphasis should not be on knowledge but on preparing others to meet the Lord and to seek after our kingship with Him. Mere intellectual exposition, even if clear, logical, and accurate, will not create in the readers a hunger after righteousness or an urge to beseech Him on their knees.</p><p>(2) There should not be too many words for each portion. If a daily portion is too long, it will not only confuse the simple ones but also be a headache for typesetting. The suggestion of putting the exposition in a book if it is too long misses the goal of the daily reading. The intention of such a calendar is to provide something that catches people's eyes, without them having to spend much time in reading it. Therefore, the ideal length would be one page per day. If there are too many words, we can use smaller type, and if the words are few, we can change to larger type. In either case we should cover each day with only one page.</p><p>(3) The style should be simple and sincere. The worst kind of writing is that which does not say anything, that "moans without sickness," that plays with words or expressions. For example, if the text is 2 Corinthians 12:9, we can use the story of the brother who applied the truth of this verse. Or if the text is John 3:16 and the emphasis is receiving eternal life through faith, we can put in the salvation story of Mr. Chapman. If the text is "Do not be slothful in zeal," we can say something like, "Just as a lazy man cannot be saved, so also a lazy believer cannot grow." However, in quoting stories or sayings of famous men, we must be accurate. Anything we quote from memory is likely to contain mistakes. If someone has passed through a crisis with the assistance of a verse, he can write a short testimony based on that verse. Of course, the words simple and sincere are easy to say but hard to pen. The only thing we can do is pray and carefully consider as we work, but not be careless and slovenly.</p><p>(4) We also need to make some decisions as to the format of the layout. If the topics are to be cyclical, we should lay out the subjects, assign certain days to them, and put them out in cycles of days. If there is to be a special line, such as an emphasis on the overcoming life, we need to put out related verses consecutively for a number of days and arrange them according to some kind of order. The format also can be completely random. The most important thing is to be living and fresh and not legal. The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. We have to pray while we work. Anything that is not produced from the Spirit is not spiritual and will not affect the spirits of others. Anything that is not from heaven will not receive blessings from heaven and will not lay up fruit in heaven. May the One who started this work in your heart also accomplish it.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />June 29, in Wan County</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
