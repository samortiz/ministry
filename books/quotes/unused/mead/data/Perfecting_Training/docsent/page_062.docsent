   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOAL OF THIS TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This stage is the goal of this training.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some day you will grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You cannot remain young.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I do believe that at least the majority of us are seeking and are growing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may be foolish, and we may waste a lot of time, but the Lord is not foolish, and He has never wasted our time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One day we will thank Him for His preservation and His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord s recovery is not just to recover the one church in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord s recovery eventually is to recover Himself as our real experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then you may ask about our ups and downs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to leave these until later.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For right now, we have to realize that on the one hand the Lord is growing within us, and on the other hand He is reducing us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is not killing us; He is reducing us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You must realize that you don t need to pray that much, and you don t need to love people that much, and you don t need to endeavor that much.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord is adding Himself into you, and He is also reducing you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You had better come to Him and stay with Him; this is what we call the proper prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You don t need to endeavor to pray that much.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You need reducing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But you cannot reduce yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This needs time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What you need right now is simply to tell Him all the time, Lord, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I want You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I like You.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I want to get with You.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is very active.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet you don t do anything; this is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is what I call active-passive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is: Be saved Acts 2:40, Darby .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BE EMPOWERED</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 2 Timothy 2:1 Paul said, Be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The King James Version renders this verse in a very self endeavoring, active way: Be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Be strong is very active, but Paul said be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You do not need to be strong, and you cannot be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if you are strong it means nothing, because John 15:5 says apart from Him we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We still can do a lot of things, but whatever we do doesn t count, so it means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Apart from Him we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we need to be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How could we be empowered?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to be calmed down, and He has to replace us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once we are calmed down and He comes in to replace us, we are empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>BE SANCTIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, the Bible doesn t tell us that we can sanctify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Old Testament we are told to be holy Lev 19:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But you have to realize according to the New Testament sense it is not a matter to be holy, but to be sanctified John 17:19; Heb 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In principle, to be holy is just like to be strong, and to be sanctified is just like to be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot be holy, but we need to be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Someone is within us sanctifying all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot be holy, but He can sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the New Testament many points like this have been either translated in the wrong way or understood in the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Actually, in the New Testament we are told not to be something, not to do something, but to be saved Acts 2:40 , to be empowered 2 Tim 2:1 , and that we may be sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means on our side we are reduced, and we are calm.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then on the Lord s side, He is active, He is living within us, He is living for us, and He is living with us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what He wants, and this is what will work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>NOT IMITATING</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to enter into the prayer and then gradually we will be reduced, and He will be added in to replace us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But there is the need of some measure of life to bring you into this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At this point you will spontaneously realize something.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To live Christ is not that we live Him, but it is actually to let Christ Himself live from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>So we need the reducing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As long as you can pray so much, you had better pray that much.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But one day you simply will not be able to pray that much.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You cannot imitate me, nor can I imitate you.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the spiritual life you may have some pattern which gives you a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if you imitate the pattern apart from the principle, it doesn t work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It doesn t mean that now you need to stop praying for your friends and for your relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you can stop, you don t need to stop; you just don t pray.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you cannot stop, you just pray.</S>
