<h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM BROTHER CHIANG CH'UAN CH'ING</h2><p>To Brother Watchman who helps me to rely on God</p><p>and teaches me how to walk in the way of obedience through his publications in the Lord:</p><p>In the ninth issue of Collection of Newsletters, I read a paragraph you wrote concerning this publication that closely matched what I had felt in my heart for a long time. This spring my life was dry and withered, so I had the idea to put away my Bible and was in a dilemma. I wanted to go into the world, but nothing could satisfy my heart. I wanted to take up the cross, but I was weak and powerless. I was really without the strength to live but not able to die. Even when the brothers who are in one accord exhorted and comforted me, it did not work. I passed through half a year in this half-living, half-dead condition. But through all this, the light of the truth of leaving the denominations and being baptized was not quenched in my heart. When I was the weakest, I continued to receive Collection of Newsletters and I felt the burden and strength in my heart to write the letter that was published in the ninth issue as "A Letter from Dairen" telling you of my condition and asking for your prayers. After this Brother Luan (Hung Pin) was led by the Lord to stay with us for three days on his way from Chefoo to Changchun. He baptized me and through the Bible helped me to know how to go in this way and how to read the Bible to cultivate life. I was helped very much. When it was time for the conference in Hangchow, I decided to quit my job and attend the meetings without caring for anything else. As I was about to leave for the conference, unexpected frustrations stepped in that made it impossible for me to go. I was very bothered about this and complained that God did not listen to my prayers. Then I thought that no matter what, it must be God's good pleasure, so I submitted. Thank God, I gained joy and peace from this which continues to this time. I also came across The Christian's Secret to a Happy Life and read it with much interest. The doctrines concerning life in it were very clear. Now I can read the Bible and pray with peace in my heart. If I have time, I testify some or fellowship with the brothers by letter. I do not pay attention to sins. I pursue holiness by the Lord's Word. For example, if I read in James 3, I would be circumspect in my speech. If I read Proverbs 3:27-28, I would give what I have according to my strength. In this way I am led by the Lord through each day.</p><p>I am now going to stop living with my elder brother. I often ask the Lord to give us a proper way to divide our inheritance. I have found the secret of escaping greed in Luke 12:13-15. Thank God, my brother has become closer to me recently.</p><p>With regard to the matter of consecration, I feel that everything is the Lord's. Are only giving money and preaching the gospel consecration? In my view, it seems that the greatest consecration in the Bible was when Joseph offered his grave to the Lord, because although the worldly people will give something to the poor, no one is willing to sell his burial plot. However, the Lord's crucifixion is already over, so what can we offer up now? Please take the trouble to answer in Collection of Newsletters. I bless you with peace. Please greet all the brothers and sisters!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chiang Ch'uan Ch'ing</p><h2 class="head2">Note from Brother Philip Luan</h2><p>Consecration does not only refer to preaching or giving money. You must receive God's choosing and calling before you can be a preacher. Similarly, you must have the ability to give before you can actually give. Consecration is to give yourself to God to do His will. The meaning of consecrating yourself is to give your all, whether it is time, money, talent, occupation, family, or all aspects of your living and place it completely in the Lord's hands, following God's will in all your decisions. Hence, consecration is not just becoming a preacher or giving money. The only proper consecration of a Christian is the kind in which your whole life and living are consecrated to do God's will.</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM BROTHER HUANG LI CH'UAN</h2><p>Greetings in the Lord to Brother Watchman Nee,</p><p> Brother Chang Kuang Jung, Brother Witness Lee,</p><p> and all the brothers who bear the responsibility of the eldership:</p><p>I have met a person named Shang T'ien Hsing (James). What kind of person is he really? He came to our locality when Brother Lai Chi Ho and I were not home, so the brothers received him. Later they were a little worried after hearing the things he said; Brother Ch'ai called me and Brother Lai home. Brother Lai and I first asked him whether he had a letter of recommendation. He said he did not. He only had a letter of recommendation from a brother in P'ing Yang who does not meet in the Lord's name. (It was from a former pastor in a denomination in Sze Hsi.) We quizzed him several times, and he seemed to keep something back in all his answers. He did not really come to the point of our questions, and he seemed to say yes and no at the same time. I thought he was a Seventh-day Adventist, but he also seemed to be like a person from Zion's Church.</p><p>The topic he preached was "Returning to Zion." For this reason, we dared not receive him. (His goal was to have a preaching meeting among us.) A few brothers disagreed and argued that it was wrong for us not to receive him. They spoke many words of misunderstanding. Please tell us about his work, denomination, and the details of his living so that there will be no misunderstanding among the brothers.</p><p>We have heard that he has some drafts ready and is preparing to put out a publication called The Preaching Paper. He also recorded the names and addresses of our brothers in his book. We also heard that he did some of the same work in P'ing Yang and Wenchow. This matter is very crucial, so for the sake of the Lord's love, we ask the brothers who are ahead in the Lord to remind, teach, and help us who are behind you, lest we receive one who should not be received. Until we meet again!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Huang Lu Ch'uan<br />November 11</p><h2 class="head2">Answer from Brother Tang Shou Ling</h2><p>With respect to Mr. Shang T'ien Hsing, we only want to say this: He advocates the doctrine of keeping the Sabbath, emphasizing the law and the doctrine that a person is not saved once for eternity. In summary, he is not one who walks in the same way with us.</p>
