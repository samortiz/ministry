   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-SIX SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOOD AND EVIL Date: February 9, 1941</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: Gen 3; Heb 4:12; 5:13-14 KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BY THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>OF GOOD AND EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>BRINGING IN DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he brought in spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man became spiritually dead in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more that a man lives in the condition of death, the more he is involved in the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As soon as a man departs from the life of God, he will be in the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The knowledge of good and evil is a sign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If man had eaten of the fruit of the tree of life, he would not have needed an outward knowledge of good and evil, because life itself can differentiate between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There would have been no need for man to acquire the knowledge of good and evil by eating the fruit of that tree.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more a man knows life, the more he knows God, and the less he will need to rely on some outward knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he separated himself from the tree of life and from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today man has fallen completely into the realm of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who are unregenerated, who do not know God, and who know nothing about life like to talk about good, evil, philosophy, ethics, morality, decency, indecency, right, and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT OF GOOD AND EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE MARK OF MATURITY IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man's communication with God is not based on good and evil, but on life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Life contains the proper knowledge of good and evil, and this knowledge of life is a mark of maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Genesis 3 there is the knowledge of good and evil that is the result of the tree of knowledge, while in Hebrews 5 there is another knowledge of good and evil that comes from the discriminating between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The knowledge of good and evil in Genesis 3 is death, while the discrimination between good and evil in Hebrews 5 is an expression of the growth and maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows us that Christians should have the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, this knowledge is a mark of the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some Christians continue to live according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are constantly trying to tell the difference between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They often ask if they should do this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are other Christians, however, who can discriminate between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But their discrimination is a discernment from God as to what is good and what is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This kind of discrimination is spiritual; it is the proper kind of knowledge for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christians should be able to tell the difference between right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is a need among Christians to differentiate between that which is good and that which is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hebrews 5:12 says that Christians should know "what the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God are" and what the deeper things are.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of discriminating is not an ordinary kind of discrimination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a discrimination of the spiritually deep things from the shallow things, the babes from the full-grown.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only is there the need to discriminate between that which is outwardly good and evil, but in the eyes of God, there is the need to discriminate between the good and evil even among all the "good" things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the eyes of God some are taking solid food and some are taking milk; some are babes and some are full-grown.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A new Christian thinks that all believers are wonderful in their life, their work, and their daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But gradually he will be able to discriminate between the good and the bad.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the beginning of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When one is mature, he will know whether a certain thing is evil in the eyes of God even though it may be considered good in the eyes of men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the mark of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Unfortunately, the church today is filled with too many childish things, and many Christians are still in the infant stage.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They still cannot discriminate between the rudimentary things and the mature things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before the Lord we must learn to have a spiritual knowledge of good and evil and not remain in the infant stage.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should have our faculties exercised for discriminating between good and evil.</S>
