<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Firstfruits to God and to the Lamb</H2><P>The next sign signifying the testimony of Jesus is the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb (Rev. 14:1-5). The Bible shows us that God is like a farmer growing a crop. We as His people are the crop that He is growing. Matthew 13 says that the Lord was a sower who went forth to sow Himself as the word of God into our being (vv. 3, 19-23). In the Epistles we see that all the believers are in a stage of growing. Paul told the Corinthians that they were God's farm, His cultivated land (1 Cor. 3:9). We are here growing on God's farm.</P><P>Eventually, in Revelation 14 there is a reaping of the crop that God has planted. But that reaping is in two stages, two parts. In the first part of Revelation 14, the believers who are the firstfruits are harvested and are standing with the Lamb on Mount Zion (vv. 1-5). Then later in the chapter we see a reaping of the majority of the believers (vv. 14-16). In this way God's whole crop gets harvested.</P><P>The firstfruits are the ones in God's crop who mature earlier. They grow and ripen first. Because they ripen first, God is able to harvest them as the firstfruits for His enjoyment. We surely desire to be harvested for God's enjoyment. The majority of the believers will be harvested at the end of the great tribulation, but the firstfruits are reaped to God's house for His satisfaction before the great tribulation.</P><P>God not only has an enemy that needs to be dealt with by the man-child; He also has a desire to be satisfied. If you ever planted anything and watched it grow, you know there is an anticipation for the day you can harvest it. I have an orange tree in my backyard, and every year I wait for those first oranges. I am so happy to enjoy them when they are ripe. Today God desires to be satisfied with the firstfruits of His crop. We want to be those who give God satisfaction by growing properly in this age.</P><P>The firstfruits are the early overcomers, the first ripe ones in God's field. Hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. The harvest will be reaped later. This means that the overcomers will be raptured to the heavens before the harvest, just as the firstfruits of the good land were reaped and brought into the temple of God before the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11; Exo. 23:19).</P><P>How do the firstfruits grow? Revelation 14:4 says that they follow the Lamb wherever He goes. If you want to grow, follow the Lamb. If you do not follow Him, you do not grow. If you are not progressing in life, you are not following the Lamb. The secret to growing, to maturing, is to follow the Lamb wherever He goes. By following Him day by day, we can gain the growth so that we can mature and ripen in this age. We do not do things because of legal requirements or religious observances. We are following the Lamb because we love Him. We want to enjoy Him and be wherever He is. I like to follow Him in this age. Wherever He is going, I want to go with Him. As He is moving in this age, I want to move where He moves. Eventually, the firstfruits, the early overcomers, will be standing on Mount Zion with the Lamb. The firstfruits will not be surprised that they have been raptured to be with the Lamb on the heavenly Mount Zion. They have been following Him wherever He goes, so if He is on Mount Zion, they are there also. We desire and aspire to be those who give God some enjoyment by ripening early in this age. We give ourselves to follow Him wherever He goes and not be touched by anything of this age.</P>
