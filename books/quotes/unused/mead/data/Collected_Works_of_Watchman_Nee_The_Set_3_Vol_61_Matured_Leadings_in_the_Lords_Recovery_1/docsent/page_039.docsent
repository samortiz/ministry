   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF THE CHURCH TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Consecration is not only a personal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the way of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are clear about a person's individual position and his way, but how should the church go on?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the first century the apostles as a body forsook everything to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the four Gospels the apostles dropped everything to follow the Lord individually.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then at the beginning of Acts three thousand and then five thousand people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church life began, and the believers followed the example of the apostles to forsake everything to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The whole church forsook everything 2:44-45; 4:32-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later the church became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The clergy-laity system was formed, and the clergy monopolized all spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The laity, composed of secular men and women, became lax.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the church did not lower its expectation concerning the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It expected the clergy to suffer, to forsake all, and to deny the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all know that Catholicism forbids its priests from marrying.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The less human they are, the more they are qualified to bear spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul's word on presenting the body as a living sacrifice is for the whole Body Rom 12:1 ; it was not addressed to the apostles alone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today everyone expects a preacher to be poor, and everyone expects the co-workers to suffer, but no one expects the ordinary believer to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This, however, is not the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a fallen concept of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the church moves on and advances, it will find that forsaking everything is not the exclusive business of the apostles but a practice that belongs to all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the past many people have had the concept that the workers should be particularly poor and suffering, that they must forsake everything before they can be considered a servant of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we are welcoming everyone to join the co-workers' lot.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, we should take the way of life and the way of service of a worker; we should live and serve accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the way the church has decided to take today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of us should rise up and be workers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that all of us have to be servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our worldly occupation is only for maintaining our livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may have different occupations, but we are all servants of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything is offered up to the Lord and to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church may assign you to be a businessman.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A person cannot live two or three times above the standard of a co-worker just because he is a businessman.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just as we expect a co-worker to be frugal, we have to be frugal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to make a resolution never to buy anything carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to save all we can and limit our spending.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This applies to every brother who has handed himself over.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the past there might have been a difference between the co-workers and those who were not co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can no longer have this distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A minister of the word cannot keep back any word for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Similarly, a moneymaker cannot keep back any money for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Holding back the Lord's word and having reservations is a cheating in the Lord's ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul, David, John, Daniel, Ezekiel, and others never hid the word in their ministry of God's word cf.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Acts 20:27; Col 1:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A minister of God's word has to share His word with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Similarly, those involved with the ministry of mammon should share their mammon with the church; they should not keep it for their own use.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From now on we should save as much as possible and sell whatever we can sell, but we should not force unbelieving parents, wives, or husbands to go along.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can only practice this ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Under all possible circumstances, we should save as much as we can save and sell as much as we can sell.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I do not advise that we eat poorly on purpose; this will ruin our health.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is not wise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should sell what we can sell but not deprive the body of its necessary nutrition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must take good care of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have the potential to use our body for another thirty years, we should use it for this time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It should not waste away in two or three years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Other than this consideration, we should save as much as we can save and give away as much as we can.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Give up everything for the saints' and for the gospel's sake.</S>
