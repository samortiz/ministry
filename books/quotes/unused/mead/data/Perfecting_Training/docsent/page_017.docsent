   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PECULIARITY THE EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NATURAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have previously pointed out that opinion is the embodiment of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But we have to realize this matter of peculiarity is much deeper than opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In principle our peculiarity is the expression of the natural self or the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may even say that peculiarity is the last or the final expression of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be peculiar is not to be sinful or to be bad or to be evil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But it is to be biased; it is to be warped.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let me also diagnose our brother s problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I don t believe humor or being humorous is his problem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to his peculiarity, deep within him there is a factor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would say that the factor within our brother may be that he always wants to be not common, but to be different from all others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the hidden factor that causes him to have the humorous, outward manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually everyone s peculiarity is caused by a certain factor within.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just to deal with the brother s jokes or humor is simply to cut off some branches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The root within him is not the joking; the root within him is the desire to be different from others and not common.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In principle we all have such a factor within us which causes us to be peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to realize that to be peculiar is not wrong; it is not evil; it is not sinful; it is not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not hating people or damaging anything, but it is the ultimate expression of our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the most hidden factor that frustrates all of us from experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I believe for many years this factor within our brother has been frustrating him very much from the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would encourage all of you to fellowship and to pray about these three things: culture, opinion, and peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Just to speak of our culture is too general, and opinion is also something on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The subtle, hidden thing that most of us would not condemn is our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do believe that many of us have condemned our opinion again and again, but not many of us have condemned our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If these three things could be thoroughly dealt with in the church life culture, opinion, and peculiarity I do believe Christ would have no frustration to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are the basic problems among us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We don t need to talk that much about worldliness, about sin, about evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But these things culture, opinion, and peculiarity are here frustrating us.</S>
