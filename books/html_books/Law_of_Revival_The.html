<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book contains five messages released by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei. These messages, given in co-workers&rsquo; meetings, present the matter of revival as a spiritual law that enables believers to grow in life and to know the Lord more personally and intimately. The dates when the messages were given are not known. These messages were originally published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> from 1960 to 1961.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES<br />
NEEDING A NEW BEGINNING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:2-3; 3:1-4; 5:2</h1>
<p>Of the sixty-six books of the Bible, only Song of Songs describes the path for pursuing the Lord. No other book in the Bible shows the stages of pursuing the Lord as clearly as Song of Songs. In this chapter we will consider our pursuit of the Lord based on Song of Songs.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR CHARACTERISTICS OF PURSUING THE LORD</h2>
<p>Song of Songs presents at least four characteristics concerning our pursuing the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Many Beginnings, Many Processes,<br />
and Many Endings</h2>
<p>According to Song of Songs, a seeker does not have only one beginning, one course, and one ending in his pursuit of the Lord. On the contrary, our pursuit of the Lord has many beginnings, many courses, and many endings. There is an initial beginning, followed by a course and an ending. Then there is a pause, which lasts for a period of time. After the pause there is another beginning in our pursuit, another course, and another ending, after which there is another pause. This book has at least six beginnings with six courses and six endings (1:2&mdash;2:7; 2:8&mdash;3:5; 3:6&mdash;5:1; 5:2&mdash;6:13; 7:1-13; 8:1-14). Each section with its beginning, course, and ending is a song. Hence, this book has six songs, and each song has a beginning, a course, and an ending.</p>
<p>This is the reason that verses are repeated two or three times in Song of Songs. For example, verse 4 of chapter 8 says, &ldquo;I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Do not rouse up or awaken my love / Until she pleases.&rdquo; This verse, which is spoken after the seeker has gone through one course and reached an ending, is also in verse 7 of chapter 2 and verse 5 of chapter 3. This shows that in our experience of pursuing the Lord, there are many beginnings, many courses, and many endings.</p>
<p>On the one hand, a seeking Christian who stumbles in the midst of a course will be able to rise up. On the other hand, even if a seeking Christian does not stumble, his pursuit of the Lord in a particular course will come to an end. We must be clear that according to what is portrayed in Song of Songs, our pursuit of the Lord does not have only one beginning that involves one course and one ending. We must also be clear that it is erroneous to think that stumbling or coming to a pause means that we have fallen. Stumbling or coming to a pause does not mean that we have fallen.</p>
<p>There are many brothers and sisters, however, whose spiritual condition is not normal. They begin to pursue the Lord, but after a period of time they stumble because they have a problem with the Lord; that is, their pursuit is interrupted in the midst of a course. It is only after a period of time that these believers are revived and begin to pursue the Lord again. We must not confuse such experiences with that of a normal Christian, who needs new beginnings even though he does not have any problems with the Lord. The Shulammite in Song of Songs has many beginnings and many pauses while she seeks her beloved. Hence, our spiritual experience is in stages, consisting of a beginning, a course, an ending, and then a pause. This is a special characteristic in Song of Songs.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Beginning of Our Pursuit<br />
Having Two Aspects</h2>
<p>According to Song of Songs, the beginning of one stage of our pursuit can differ from the beginning of another stage. Some stages begin because the Lord draws us, but other stages begin because we are hungry for the Lord. For example, in the first stage it is hard to determine whether the seeker pursues her beloved because he draws her or because of her desire. Her pursuit in the first stage is probably the result of both. In the beginning of this stage she says, &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!&rdquo; (1:2a). It seems that she is taking the initiative to pursue her beloved. However, immediately following this she says, &ldquo;For your love is better than wine. / Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; / Your name is like ointment poured forth; / Therefore the virgins love you&rdquo; (vv. 2b-3). This shows that she is drawn by her beloved. Therefore, in the initial stage of our pursuit it is hard to determine whether we are pursuing the Lord, or He is drawing us.</p>
<p>In some of the later stages the seeker pursues her beloved without his drawing her. For example, in verses 1 and 2 of chapter 3 the seeker is not being drawn, but she still pursues her beloved. She says, &ldquo;On my bed night after night / I sought him whom my soul loves; / I sought him, but found him not. / I will rise now and go about in the city; / In the streets and in the squares / I will seek him whom my soul loves.&rdquo; These verses begin with her seeking, not with her being drawn. In verse 2 of chapter 5 she says, &ldquo;I sleep, but my heart is awake. / A sound! My beloved is knocking. / Open to me, my sister, my love, / My dove, my perfect one; / For my head is drenched with dew, / My locks with the drops of night.&rdquo; This is the beloved drawing the Shulammite. This is not her initiating the seeking. Thus, there are two aspects to the beginning of our seeking of the Lord. One aspect is that the Lord comes and draws us. The emphasis of this aspect is His appearing. When the Lord appears to us and draws us, we rise up to seek Him. The other aspect is that we take the initiative to pursue the Lord. Although we taste the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness in our fellowship with Him, after a period of time we feel unsatisfied and therefore have a desire to pursue Him again.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Reaching a State of Fullness in Every Stage</h2>
<p>In terms of the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we can reach a state of fullness in every stage of our spiritual pursuit. For example, in the first stage the seeker feasted with her beloved at his table (1:12). Poetic expressions, such as &ldquo;Our couch is green,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The beams of our house are cedars&rdquo; (vv. 16-17), show that she fully enjoys her beloved&rsquo;s presence. After seeking and eventually finding her beloved in chapter 3, the Shulammite brings him into the chamber of the one who conceived her (v. 4). This portrays our being brought into the grace of God to fully enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This shows our reaching the fullness of the Lord&rsquo;s presence yet again. Hence, the course in each stage of our spiritual pursuit issues in a fullness of the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The State of Fullness in Every Stage<br />
Coming to an End</h2>
<p>Song of Songs reveals that at the end of every stage, a seeker of the Lord will always feel unsatisfied. Hence, there is an end to the sense of satisfaction reached in the fullness. This end enables us to begin a new pursuit.</p>
<p>These four characteristics enable us to understand our experience of pursuing the Lord. We will now apply these characteristics to our experience.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING A NEW BEGINNING</h2>
<p>We are mistaken if we hope that our spiritual seeking will have only one beginning with one course and one ending. Such an expectation will never be fulfilled. There will always be several stages in our experience of the Lord, and each stage will have a beginning, a course, and an ending. This is clearly seen in the biographies of normal believers throughout church history. For example, according to her autobiography, Madame Guyon did not stumble, but she experienced several new beginnings. She said that she renewed her bridal covenant with the Lord. Every renewal of her bridal covenant was a new beginning. Before she could experience a new beginning, she must have experienced an end, a conclusion, to the previous stage. Hence, even if we do not stumble, there should be many new beginnings in our spiritual pursuit. This means that we must come to an end so that we can have another beginning.</p>
<p>After obtaining a sense of satisfaction in the process of pursuing and following the Lord, it is normal to feel empty and dissatisfied and to feel that we have lost the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This feeling of emptiness and dissatisfaction is a sign, telling us that it is time for a new beginning. This feeling of dissatisfaction can be likened to the green traffic signal that tells us to advance. A red light tells us to stop, but when the light turns green, we can continue on our journey. The inner feeling of dissatisfaction is the green light in our spiritual journey. Dissatisfaction includes feelings of darkness, emptiness, oldness, weakness, and losing heart. It also includes the sense of being unable to touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence, of losing our taste for prayer, of not receiving light from the Bible, of being dry when giving messages, and of losing the anointing. These feelings are not accidental. They are a sign, telling us that it is time for a new pursuit.</p>
<p>The more we fellowship, the more we will sense our need for a new beginning. The church has reached the ending of one stage and therefore needs a new beginning. If we do not have a new beginning, we will inevitably fall into formal service and religious worship.</p>
<p>Formal service and religious worship involve observing rules and following regulations. Our service may have been living and fresh seven or eight years ago, but it will be dead and old if we are still serving in the same way. For example, the Old Testament service was living at Moses&rsquo; time, but after many years it lost its vitality and became dead. In order to be delivered from formal service and religious worship, the church must have a new beginning. This does not mean that we need a new method or a new way. Our ground is right. The way that we carry out the service is also right, but it lacks vitality. I hope that the serving ones can sense the oldness. The serving ones must have a new beginning so that they can influence the saints and thus cause the churches to have a new beginning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A NEW BEGINNING NEEDING<br />
A NEW CONSECRATION AND A NEW DEALING</h2>
<p>In order to have a new beginning, we must have a new consecration. Someone may say, &ldquo;I have consecrated myself many times; I do not have anything else to consecrate.&rdquo; However, we must consecrate ourselves afresh every time we have a new beginning.</p>
<p>With every new pursuit we also must have a new dealing. After our consecration there must be a new dealing. On the surface Song of Songs does not concern dealings; however, if we study this book in depth, we will see that there are dealings hidden in it. After the seeker reached the fullness in the first stage, she lingered in her experience and cared for that experience instead of for her beloved. As a result, when she rose up to seek her beloved, he did not let her find him (2:16&mdash;3:3). This was a discipline. Such discipline educates and trains us to know that we are not in the position to decide anything related to our communion with the Lord. We must let the Lord decide everything. If the Lord wants to come, we must let Him come; if the Lord wants to stay, we must let Him stay; and if the Lord wants to go, we must let Him go. We do not have a say in these matters. This is clearly portrayed in the second stage in Song of Songs.</p>
<p>In 3:1-4 the seeker says, &ldquo;On my bed night after night / I sought him whom my soul loves; / I sought him, but found him not. / I will rise now and go about in the city; / In the streets and in the squares / I will seek him whom my soul loves. / I sought him, but found him not. / The watchmen who go about in the city found me&mdash; / Have you seen him whom my soul loves? / Scarcely had I passed them / When I found him whom my soul loves; / I held him and would not let go / Until I had brought him into my mother&rsquo;s house / And into the chamber of her who conceived me.&rdquo; In these verses the seeker rises up to seek her beloved, but she cannot find him. She goes out to look for him but cannot find him. She then inquires of others about him but to no avail. When she is disappointed and helpless, her beloved comes, and she finds him. When she wants her beloved, he stays away from her, but when she is fully disappointed, he comes to her. The Lord uses such experiences to train us. When we cannot find the Lord, we may be full of remorse, thinking, &ldquo;I hold on to my opinion when I fellowship with the Lord. This is my sin.&rdquo; In the depth of our being we might sense that we need to deal with a sin, but it is not something outward or superficial. Those who genuinely seek the Lord do not necessarily deal with outward or superficial sins. Other believers might not see the sins that we have committed, because our problems with the Lord issue from the depth of our being. Hence, we need to deal with the sins that are within us. This requires a fresh consecration related to the dealing that causes us to rise up to pursue the Lord.</p>
<p>Our consecration and dealings with the Lord are continuous and should get deeper. Our initial consecration is somewhat shallow. Prior to our salvation we may have indulged in the pleasures of the world and in sinful things, but after our salvation we are willing to consecrate our time, money, and energy to the Lord for His use. This consecration is good, but it is not deep. We must have more consecrations. Perhaps the Lord will cause us to sense that a part of our being is still not open to Him or that there is something that we are not willing to drop. In the past the Lord would not touch such matters, but now He will not let these go. This is when we need to renew our consecration. We might be loose in outward matters, such as our time and our money, so the Lord will touch these matters because we have consecrated them to Him. But He is also concerned with the problem within us. There was a reservation within us when we first consecrated ourselves, but the Lord was tolerant. Now, however, He wants us to hand over to Him the things we have reserved. If we are not willing to let them go, we can lose His presence, and we will not be enlivened. This is the time when we must have a deeper consecration.</p>
<p>The Lord may deal with a brother concerning individualism. Although this brother does not argue with others, he does not like to be with other brothers. This is individualism. The Lord wants us to see that we are individualistic and that we must deal with it, but we insist on keeping our individualistic habits. This insistence makes us old and causes us to lose our freshness and vitality. Although we were individualistic when we received the Lord, He did not touch it; hence, we were fresh. Now, however, the Lord is touching our individualism and wants us to drop it, but if we are unwilling to renew our consecration in this matter, He will not let us go. As a result, we will lose our freshness and become old, and those with whom we fellowship will touch oldness and staleness instead of freshness and life. Furthermore, it will be difficult for us to advance in the Lord.</p>
<p>In order to have a new beginning, there must be consecration and dealings. This is a principle. However, our consecration and dealings in the different stages differ in depth. Initially, the dealings are outward and superficial, but with time they become deeper and finer, and even our spiritual experiences are dealt with. Abraham went through many dealings, and eventually even Isaac, whom Abraham obtained through God&rsquo;s grace, had to be offered (Gen. 22:1-19). Not only did he have to cast out Ishmael, who was born according to his flesh (21:9-14); Abraham had to offer up Isaac also, whom he gained through God&rsquo;s promise of grace, on the altar. This was a deep and genuine consecration.</p>
<p>The same principle is portrayed in Song of Songs. In the fourth stage of the seeker&rsquo;s experience, her previous spiritual attainments are condemned and must be consecrated. Hence, if we desire to have a new beginning, to be renewed and vitalized, we must have a new consecration and a new dealing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE IN EVERY STAGE BEING CHRIST<br />
AND HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Although there are six stages of spiritual experience in Song of Songs, a seeker does not experience one thing in the first stage, another thing in the second stage, and yet another thing in the third stage, and so forth. Rather, the seeker has every spiritual experience in the first stage, but she does not experience them in their full measure. In principle, her experiences in the second stage are the same as her experiences in the first stage; however, the degree of the fullness of her experience has increased. In the third stage she experiences the same things that she did in the previous stages, but the measure of these experiences has increased. This continues through the fourth, fifth, and the sixth stages. In principle, in each stage she has the same experiences that she had in the first stage. Although the seeker does not experience anything new in the different stages, the experiences are new, and the measure of the experience is increased.</p>
<p>In our spiritual pursuit we do not experience different things in different stages. In the past we clearly demarcated the four stages of our spiritual life (see <em>The Experience of Life</em>). However, in our experience the stages are not clearly defined, because our experiences in the first stage include most of what we will experience later. Our future experiences do not differ from our initial experiences; our experiences will only become deeper, higher, stronger, and richer. This can be compared to dyeing a piece of cloth. In the beginning of the dyeing process, the color of the cloth is light, but the color deepens with each application until it reaches its deepest hue. Our spiritual experience is similar to this.</p>
<p>In terms of revelation, in every stage we experience Christ. In terms of application, we experience His death and resurrection. Hence, all our spiritual experiences are of Christ and His death and resurrection. Even a new believer experiences Christ and His death and resurrection. A person believes and is baptized because he knows Christ and has experienced His death, burial, and resurrection. This is our experience in the beginning of our Christian life, and we continue in this experience for the rest of our lives as we advance from stage to stage. According to Song of Songs, the Christ we know in the first stage is the same person we continue to know in the later stages, and the death and resurrection we experience in the first stage are the death and resurrection we will experience in the later stages. The only difference is that our experiences will gradually become deeper and richer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING RENEWED FOR GENUINE SERVICE</h2>
<p>Our work and service should be according to the experience in Song of Songs. We should not do a habitual work that merely maintains the status quo. This is the condition in Christianity where a pastor is hired to give a sermon every Lord&rsquo;s Day. The sermons might be delivered in a good way, and the congregation might understand and remember what is spoken, but this understanding and remembering do not have any effect on the hearers. The sermons produce an increase in Bible knowledge but do not cause the hearers to rise up to pursue and experience the Lord. This is a habitual work that maintains the status quo. There is no light or experience in this work. We should not maintain such a religious situation in the churches. We should not do a work that seemingly touches people but does not change them. Rather, our work should always help people either in the beginning, during the course, or in the ending of a stage of their spiritual pursuit. We must always lead people to experience and pursue the Lord. Those who have not consecrated themselves should be brought to consecration. Those who have not experienced dealings should be brought into receiving the dealings. Those who have consecrated in the past but are presently in a low situation should be helped to renew their consecration. Those who have had dealings in the past but have lost their freshness should be helped to have fresh dealings with the Lord. Those who had spiritual experiences in the past but have become dull and dry and lack light and strength should be helped to rise up to seek the Lord again. If we are continually renewed, the old things will become new, and our service will be genuine, not habitual.</p>
<p>As those who serve the Lord, we continually contact people whether by giving messages or by visiting them. Hence, we need to do a work of renewing, and we need to be renewed. We should not think that we are doing well because we are not sinful or fleshly, have proper conduct, read the Bible, are touched by the Lord, and pray. These maintain our spiritual condition, but because they will not cause us to progress, the work and the church will become old. Even if we do not have other problems, oldness is a problem. Only by having a new beginning with a new consecration and new dealings will our work be fresh, and the church will experience another stage of the Lord&rsquo;s fresh presence.</p>
<p>The seeker in Song of Songs rises up to seek her beloved even at night. She says, &ldquo;On my bed night after night / I sought him whom my soul loves; / I sought him, but found him not. / I will rise now and go about in the city; / In the streets and in the squares / I will seek him whom my soul loves&rdquo; (3:1-2). We need to seek the Lord; we should not be indifferent. The sense of being low and of losing the Lord&rsquo;s presence should serve as a green light that urges us to rise up and move forward. We must seek the Lord, have dealings with Him, and have a new consecration according to our inner feeling.</p>
<p>When we rise up to seek the Lord, we will spontaneously cause others to seek the Lord together with us. The beginning of our seeking the Lord has two aspects. Either the Lord draws us, or our sense of thirst and hunger causes us to pursue Him. When we experience the Lord&rsquo;s abundance, we will rise up, just as the seeker in Song of Songs did, and say, &ldquo;I feast with the Lord at His table and enjoy His abundance. I delight and sit down in His shade, and His fruit is sweet to my taste&rdquo; (cf. 1:12; 2:3). Such a testimony will produce a hunger and longing in those who hear us, and they will be willing to seek the Lord in order to gain the same experience. Perhaps our experience is not full, and we have a sense of dissatisfaction in our heart. As this sense of dissatisfaction grows stronger, we will desperately long for the Lord. When we speak with others concerning our dissatisfaction, there will be an echo within them, and they will sense a hunger and thirst for the Lord. Hence, as long as we seek the Lord, whether we are feasting with Him or are hungry and thirsty for Him, we will affect others and cause them to hunger. As a result, they will also rise up to seek the Lord.</p>
<p>We all need to bring this word before the Lord in prayer. We do not need to look at others; rather, we need to see our condition. Do we need to be renewed and revived to have a new consecration and new dealings with the Lord? If the Lord has mercy on us, He will appear to us and draw us to rise up and seek Him, or He will cause us to feel hungry and dissatisfied, which will force us to rise up and seek Him. Then we will be revived, and everything related to us will become new. The Bible we read will be new, the hymns we sing will be new, and even the spiritual books we read will be new. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, may we all have such a new revival.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SERVING ONES NEEDING TO<br />
BE DELIVERED FROM LIVING<br />
ACCORDING TO FEELINGS<br />
AND TO OPEN TO THE LORD<br />
TO BRING IN A REVIVAL</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM LIVING<br />
ACCORDING TO FEELINGS</h2>
<p>In their experience many serving ones still cannot tell the difference between living according to feelings and living by faith. They may know the difference in words, but very few know the difference in their experience. Most still live in their feelings; it is hard to find a serving one who lives by faith. Some have served for a number of years, but not many have been delivered from their feelings, and even fewer can live by faith.</p>
<p>This conclusion is based on two conditions that we have observed among the serving ones. A few are living and fresh. They testify of the Lord&rsquo;s presence and of touching Him and sensing His sweetness in prayer and in the Word. Most of the serving ones, however, have lost this sweet experience. They sense neither the Lord&rsquo;s presence nor His sweetness. Instead of being fresh and living, they are down and oppressed and want to withdraw from the service. It seems that there is a difference between these two conditions and that the first condition is better than the second. However, both conditions show that the saints are living according to their feelings. Their spiritual journey is according to their emotions; that is, their relationship with the Lord is based on their emotions.</p>
<p>Those who have spiritual experience know that it is difficult to come out of the stage of living according to one&rsquo;s emotions. This stage can last for a long time. Furthermore, believers in this stage are confused by the trials that they pass through. According to his biography, Brother Hudson Taylor experienced such trials. For a period of time he did not sense the Lord&rsquo;s loveliness when he read the Word, prayed, or fellowshipped with the Lord. Brother Hudson Taylor did not understand the cause of this condition. Most believers have had such an experience. A brother might have wonderful fellowship with the Lord and feel sweet, fresh, and revived, but when he goes through a trial, he becomes low and oppressed and loses his freshness. It is possible for a believer to have this kind of experience many times, that is, to emotionally rise and fall like a wave in the ocean. The amount of rising and falling is related to his natural disposition. A believer who is very emotional tends to fluctuate more noticeably than a believer who is not very emotional. Some believers are delivered from such a life after a few experiences, but others remain in this stage even after numerous experiences.</p>
<p>I have a deep sense within that the Lord wants to lead us to experience something new and wonderful. He wants to lead us out of living according to our feelings, because such a life is a great hindrance.</p>
<p>According to Song of Songs, there are six stages in our spiritual experience. The first stage is from 1:2 through 2:7, the second stage is from 2:8 through 3:5, the third stage is from 3:6 through 5:1, the fourth stage is from 5:2 through 6:13, the fifth stage is from 7:1 through verse 13, and the sixth stage is from 8:1 through verse 14. The first stage is the fundamental stage. If we can understand the first stage, Song of Songs will be an open book to us. A particular point in the first stage is that there is not much revelation of the beloved to his seeker. The content of this stage is mainly the speaking of the seeker, based on her experience and feeling. At the beginning of her speaking, she says, &ldquo;Your love is better than wine&rdquo; (1:2). This is her experience as well as her feeling; it is not a revelation. Hence, our knowledge of the Lord in the initial stage is mainly from our experience; it is not based on revelation. The seeker says that her beloved is like &ldquo;a bundle of myrrh,&rdquo; &ldquo;a cluster of henna flowers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the apple tree among the trees of the wood&rdquo; (vv. 13-14; 2:3). These words are based on feelings realized in her experience.</p>
<p>Hence, this stage of our spiritual pursuit is altogether involved with feelings. The seeker says, &ldquo;Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock? / Where do you make it lie down at noon? / For why should I be like one who is veiled / Beside the flocks of your companions?&rdquo; (1:7). These words imply that those who do not pursue the Lord are starving and are wandering and that she also is not satisfied and does not have rest; hence, she is put to shame. She is not different from those who do not pursue the Lord. However, she feels that there is no reason to be put to shame. She should be fed and thus have satisfaction, and she should lie down where the Lord pastures His flock and thus have rest.</p>
<p>In the first stage a seeker&rsquo;s praise to the Lord, knowledge of the Lord, and pursuit of the Lord originate from feelings. The seeker lacks objective vision and revelation. Her praises and pursuit are an expression of her subjective experience and subjective feelings. She lacks objective knowledge and utterance; everything is subjective. Believers who fall into subjectivity tend to become shallow. If we desire to be deep, we must have objective visions. Our knowledge and seeing must be from above; they should be apart from our feelings. In the first stage of spiritual experience portrayed in Song of Songs, the seeker does not have such a seeing. On the one hand, it is good that her words are based on her experience. She is not like most people who utter empty doctrines. On the other hand, however, her experiences are shallow and lack revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING THE VISION OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Not many saints have seen a vision or received revelation. Most saints live according to their emotions. Hence, their relationships with others and with the Lord are based on emotions. Just like the maiden in the first section of Song of Songs, they lack objective vision.</p>
<p>The objective and higher vision begins in Song of Songs 2:8 and 9: &ldquo;Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills. / My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart.&rdquo; Before this time the seeker has spiritual experiences, but she lacks vision. Her utterances in her praises and prayers come from the feelings that she gains in her experiences. Although this is precious, she cannot go forward if she remains in these experiences.</p>
<p>Hence, at the beginning of the second stage the beloved comes in. The seeker did not ask the beloved to come, but he comes to remind her. In the first stage a seeker has an affectionate and loving fellowship with the Lord, having tasted His sweetness and enjoyed His abundance. This is portrayed in the words of the seeker in Song of Songs: &ldquo;While the king was at his table, / My spikenard gave forth its fragrance. / My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh / That lies at night between my breasts. / My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers / In the vineyards of En-gedi... / As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: / In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste. / He brought me into the banqueting house, / And his banner over me was love&rdquo; (1:12-14; 2:3-4). This description shows that she enjoys the beloved&rsquo;s abundance and experiences his sweetness. At the same time, however, she retreats into a room and unknowingly shuts her beloved out. This room is not completely closed, because it has a window, an opening, through which she can see her beloved. He is leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills like a young hart (vv. 8-9). There is no feeling of sweetness or enjoyment from rest and satisfaction in these verses. What the seeker sees is the expression of strength, vitality, and power. She sees her beloved leaping and skipping upon the mountains and hills like a young hart. Mountains are high, but a young hart is able to leap and skip upon them. Instead of being impressed by something subjective or experiential, the seeker sees an objective vision.</p>
<p>The serving ones, in particular, need to see this vision. Most of the saints still live according to feelings. We expect to be satisfied with the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness, but instead of having fresh and sweet feelings, we are low, oppressed, and deadened. Therefore, we think that we either have a problem, have fallen, or are no longer useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. In addition, our environment is full of &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; and &ldquo;hills.&rdquo; Some of us have health problems, some have family problems, and some have problems at work, problems with the co-workers, or problems in the church. Formerly, everything in our living and our service was smooth, and our way was straight, level, and full of light. But it is no longer so. There are hills and high mountains everywhere; there is no way out. Our situation is truly difficult. It is in this kind of situation that we need a vision, an objective seeing, a further knowledge of the Lord.</p>
<p>We seem to be advancing in our knowledge of the Lord, but our experiences are still in the first stage of Song of Songs. Our praises, thanksgiving, prayers, and testimonies indicate that our relationship with the Lord is still in the first stage. In our experience we know that the Lord is lovely and satisfying. But such knowledge of the Lord is insufficient; we must know the Lord in more ways. We need to experience the Lord in the second stage of Song of Songs.</p>
<p>The experience of the second stage is not a matter of the Lord giving us rest and satisfaction but of our seeing Him as the resurrected Lord, who has the power and vitality to leap upon the mountains and skip upon the hills in His move. In the first stage the seeker wants to go to the beloved in order to receive satisfaction and rest. Now, instead of her asking, the Lord calls her, saying, &ldquo;Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come away&rdquo; (v. 10). This is a matter of moving, not of enjoyment. For our enjoyment we need satisfaction and rest, but for our move we need power and vitality. The beloved says, &ldquo;Rise up...and come away; / For now the winter is past; / The rain is over and gone. / Flowers appear on the earth; / The time of singing has come, / And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. / ...come away&rdquo; (vv. 10-13). In such an atmosphere of resurrection and freshness the Lord wants His seekers to rise up and come away with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FURTHER SEEING OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Although the beloved is calling, the seeker lingers in herself. She says, &ldquo;My beloved is mine, and I am his; / He pastures his flock among the lilies&rdquo; (v. 16). She has not forgotten that the beloved is her enjoyment; she cannot drop the matter of enjoyment. This picture can be applied to our situation. Many saints are old and deadened because they have been living according to their emotions for so long but are still unwilling to come out of their emotions. Some say, &ldquo;Our situation was better five years ago when it was so sweet to pray and fellowship with the brothers, but it is no longer like that. The feeling of sweetness is no longer strong.&rdquo; This shows our unwillingness to part with the past. Such sentiments are in the self and are based on our feelings.</p>
<p>Such lingering thoughts are useless. If we remain in the past, we will also lose the Lord&rsquo;s presence, because He cannot remain in the past. Hence, the experiences from the first stage of Song of Songs are useless in the second stage. What the seeker sees at the beginning of the second stage is something not within her self&mdash;not in her feelings and not in her imagination. She sees a vision that is outside of the self: &ldquo;Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills. / My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). Such a vision shows that the Lord wants us to stop living according to our emotions, that is, to stop caring for our enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest. We must break away from these things and see that the Lord is in resurrection. By such a seeing, we will take a further step and know the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>It is not so easy for those who live in the experiences of the first stage to be delivered from their feelings. In the second stage the beloved gives his seeker a vision of himself as a young hart leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills, and he also calls her to rise up and come away with him (vv. 8-13). However, the seeker remains in the feelings of her former experiences (v. 16). As a result, the beloved leaves. In 3:1 the seeker is on her bed lingering in her spiritual enjoyment, but she cannot find her beloved. Hence, she is compelled to leave the place of her enjoyment and go out into the streets to seek him (v. 2). At first she cannot find him, but he later appears to her, and she holds on to him and drags him into her enjoyment (v. 4). Thus, it is not easy to break away from living for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>It is possible for us to remain in the stage of living according to our feelings for a long time. Perhaps some of us will now experience something new and have a new revival. However, I am concerned that those who are revived will repeat the mistake of holding on to the Lord and forcing Him to stay in their past experiences. The period of silence in verse 5 is rather lengthy. The seeker stays there for a long time. In other words, she returns to living according to her emotions. The seeker&rsquo;s condition changes at the beginning of the third stage, which is after this long period of silence. In the third stage she is like pillars of smoke, soaring and transcendent (v. 6). She is also Solomon&rsquo;s palanquin (v. 9), meaning that she is able to move. Hence, in the third stage we are delivered from living according to our enjoyment and are in the Lord&rsquo;s move. We experience this change after we have further knowledge of resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING THE VISION OF RESURRECTION<br />
DELIVERING US FROM EVERY PROBLEM</h2>
<p>We all need to see this vision of resurrection. Only then can we leap upon the mountains and skip upon the hills, that is, overcome our environment. The problems in our heart, in our family, in our environment, and in the church are mountains and hills that cannot be overcome merely by our enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness and abundance. These problems require that we have the vision of resurrection and see the transcendence of our resurrected Lord, who is undeterred by any problem. This is the only way that we can overcome our problems.</p>
<p>I believe that some saints will see such a vision. The Lord will bring us out of living according to our emotions so that our relationship with Him will be based on revelation and vision, not on emotions. We will see that He is in resurrection and that He dwells in us. This resurrected Lord is the power of resurrection. Once we see this vision, we will be delivered, and we, like the Lord, will be able to leap upon mountains and skip upon hills. Then strong opposition, burdensome troubles, grave sickness, and great turmoil and torment will not restrict us, because we no longer experience the Lord merely as a bundle of myrrh or a cluster of henna flowers. Rather, in our experience He will be like a young hart leaping upon mountains and skipping upon hills; He cannot be deterred by any environment. A bundle of myrrh may be fragrant, and a cluster of henna flowers may be beautiful, but they are powerless. Power rests with the young hart and is in resurrection.</p>
<p>Our problems exist because we know only how the Lord satisfies us and gives us rest. We have yet to see that He is the resurrected Lord, that He is in resurrection, and that His resurrection power is in us. Therefore, we continue to live according to our feelings, in the ups and downs of our emotions. When we feel good, we are excited, but when we do not feel good, we are oppressed. We rejoice when we touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence, but we are miserable when we cannot touch His presence. We praise and give thanks when the environment is smooth, but we murmur and complain when the environment is rough. These reactions prove that we urgently need an objective vision of Christ in resurrection. When we see this vision, we will transcend our difficulties. We will be able to soar and to move like a pillar of smoke. We will not be restricted by a desolate situation, nor will we be troubled by our outward environment. The turmoils and disturbances will be under our feet; we will be above them, skipping upon the mountains and leaping upon the hills. How we urgently need such a vision and experience!</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM LIVING<br />
ACCORDING TO FEELINGS<br />
EQUIVALENT TO BEING DELIVERED FROM THE SELF</h2>
<p>When the Lord calls us to come out of our feelings, He wants us to come out of the self. In chapter 3 the beloved compels his seeker not only to rise from her bed but also to come out of her house (vv. 1-2). In these verses the beloved is compelling his seeker to be delivered from living according to her emotions, which is to be delivered from the self.</p>
<p>Many of us are shut in the &ldquo;room&rdquo; of the self. Many are locked in the self. We are often closed when we attend meetings and when we visit the saints, because we still live according to our emotions. When we came together seven or eight years ago, we were open and released because we had a sweet feeling, but we no longer have such a sweet feeling, and the taste of freshness and vitality is gone. As a result, we are closed in the self and are not willing to open. Both our past and present situations prove that we have not been delivered from living a life according to our feelings, which is to live in the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A REVIVAL BY OPENING</h2>
<p>The only way to have a revival, a new beginning, is to be open. This is the only way to be fresh. We need to open and be released instead of being locked inside the self. It is very simple to open ourselves. For example, instead of being shut within our oppressed self, we can tell a brother that we feel oppressed and old. If we would open to one another whenever we meet together, there would be a revival among us. There are many serving ones in the churches. On the one hand, we know one another because we see one another nearly every day, but on the other hand, we do not know one another, because we are closed. I do not open my inner spiritual condition to you, and you do not reveal your inner spiritual condition to me. How can there be a revival among us under such circumstances?</p>
<p>Throughout church history, those who sought for a revival always prayed for power from heaven to rain on them. However, the believers who experienced being revived testified that genuine revivals do not come from heaven. Revivals come from within us, because the resurrected Lord is now the Spirit indwelling us. The Spirit is filled with all the riches of Christ and dwells even in the most desolate believer. Hence, the power of revival does not descend from heaven, from an objective position. This power is already dwelling in us. The question is whether this power can come forth, that is, whether we will let this power come forth.</p>
<p>We often do not understand the Lord&rsquo;s word. Romans 10:6-9 says, &ldquo;Do not say in your heart, &lsquo;Who will ascend into heaven?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ down; or, &lsquo;Who will descend into the abyss?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ up from the dead...&lsquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,&rsquo;...that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&rdquo; A person who desires to be saved does not have to ascend into heaven or descend into the earth in order to find Christ, because the word is near him, in his mouth and in his heart. Therefore, once a person believes and confesses, he is saved. This word is for those who have not experienced salvation and do not have the Holy Spirit within them. If it is so easy for them to be saved, how much easier would it be for those who are saved and have the Spirit dwelling in them to be revived? We should not think that the revival will come to us from heaven or from the abyss; it simply needs to flow out of us. The impression that we receive from reading the history of revivals in the church is that believers anticipate that revivals would descend from above. However, those who have experience realize that the power they thought would descend from above actually flows out of their inner being. Hence, the key to revival is being open. The power in us is an explosive force. As long as we are willing to open and let it explode from within us, we will have a prevailing revival.</p>
<p>It is right to say that we need to pray in order to have a revival. However, I must repeat that the key, the secret, of having a revival is not in our asking the Lord to give us something from above but in our opening to Him and letting Him flow out. Being open is the basic principle for allowing the Holy Spirit to work in us. The more we are reserved and closed, the less likely we are to receive grace. More than twenty years ago the Pentecostal movement was popular in northern China. This movement focused on people receiving the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Although many things in this movement were extreme and even heretical, it encouraged those who were closed and reserved to open.</p>
<p>For example, a helper would kneel down with someone and lead him to confess his sins. The helper would ask, &ldquo;Do you have sins?&rdquo; and the person would say, &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo; Then the helper would ask, &ldquo;What kind of sins?&rdquo; and the person might answer, &ldquo;I offended my parents.&rdquo; The helper would further ask, &ldquo;How did you offend your parents?&rdquo; This questioning and answering would continue until the person finished confessing his sins. As a result, his entire being would be open, and he would receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. We might say that this was human work; nevertheless, human work ushers in the work of heaven so that the Holy Spirit can be poured out upon man. Some of the people who experienced such an outpouring were delivered from their addictions or forsook their bad habits and sins. This is an important principle: it is easy for a person who is open to receive grace.</p>
<p>This is where our problem lies. When we come together for fellowship or in the meetings, we are closed. Most of the saints who come to the prayer meeting on Tuesday night come with a closed attitude. They have made up their mind not to open their mouth to pray. How can we have a strong prayer meeting? Perhaps in the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting we should give messages concerning being open in order to encourage the saints to open. Some saints might feel reluctant to speak because they are not &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; by the Holy Spirit. However, as long as we are open, inspiration will come. The less we open, the more difficult it will be to open, and the more we wait for inspiration, the less inspiration we will receive.</p>
<p>We have a treasure in us, but it is locked up. It does not matter whether we are weak, strong, cold, or burning. When we are burning, this rich source is in us, and when we are cold, this rich source is still in us. This source never changes. The question is whether we would let it flow out.</p>
<p>When I was young, I liked to play with firecrackers. I would get about a dozen firecrackers and use a pin to open the paper wrapping around the fuse so that the gunpowder was exposed. Then I would set off a couple of firecrackers and let them explode. The sparks from these firecrackers would touch other firecrackers and kindle the gunpowder. As a result, all the firecrackers would explode. This analogy is fitting for Christians. Each of us is a firecracker, and Christ is our gunpowder. Our problem is that Christ is securely wrapped within us, and we are neither willing to be broken nor to open. We pray for a revival, but we keep ourselves tightly closed. Hence, we cannot &ldquo;explode,&rdquo; and even our earnest prayer does not avail. If we want to pray, we should pray that the Lord would cause us to open.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING OPEN IN ORDER TO BRING IN A REVIVAL</h2>
<p>We must submit to the Lord and humbly ask Him to give us a vision. We should not merely have enjoyment, satisfaction, and a sense of sweetness in our pursuit of the Lord. We need to see that the Lord is in resurrection. We need a vision of resurrection so that we would be able to leap upon the mountains and skip upon the hills. In spite of the things pressing on our spirit and the difficulties in our environment, we need to see that the Lord is living and strong in us; He is leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills. If we would know resurrection and be open, we would be like unwrapped firecrackers. Once one firecracker explodes, it can kindle the others. If I am open, I can burn someone else until he is open, and then he can burn me. As a result, we will have a genuine revival. Both lingering in our past experiences and remaining closed will result in death. The more we linger in our past experiences and remain closed, the more deadened we will be. We must learn to be open. Even if we are skeptical, we should still practice to be open in every occasion. Then the unlimited supply will gush up from within us, and we will experience a spiritual revival.</p>
<p>To be open does not mean to speak a frank word or to rebuke others. That is to spread death. To be open is to pour out and speak forth our true condition. If we feel weak, corrupt, deficient, old, stale, or dead, we should open our situation. The Lord is in us, and when we open in this way, He comes forth. This is the secret to having a revival. If we study the revivals in church history, we will find that this is the secret. We need to pray more so that we would be open, and we need power so that we may help others to open. Once a person opens, he will be revived. If we know this key and are willing to be open in every meeting and in our times of fellowship, we will be living, and the Lord will have a way to move.</p>
<p>I hope that these words will cause us to open and let the Lord flow forth. This principle will bring in a revival.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h1>
<h2 class="head1">REVIVAL BEING A LAW OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE</h2>
<p>After studying the biographies of many spiritual men and the revivals that we have experienced in the past, we have come to the conclusion that revival is a law of the spiritual life.</p>
<p>Every organism has its own laws. Biology is the study of the laws of various organisms, including the phenomena and the issue of the operation of these laws. Our spiritual life also has many laws. For example, Romans 8:2 speaks of &ldquo;the law of the Spirit of life,&rdquo; and Hebrews 8:10 speaks of the laws that God will inscribe on our hearts. There is another law of the spiritual life related to revival. Although I have observed revivals and also experienced revivals, I never considered that revival is a law. Therefore, I have not given any messages concerning the law of revival.</p>
<p>In Christianity the word <em>revival</em> is often used in the context of a spiritual reawakening. This understanding is applied to a Christian who becomes cold, stumbles, goes back to the world, or falls into sin, but if he later rises up again to love and pursue the Lord, he has experienced a reawakening, a revival. This, however, is not what the Bible reveals as a revival in the normal experience of a Christian. It is true that a person who stumbles, becomes cold, or backslides needs to be revived. However, even if a person does not stumble, become cold, or backslide, he still needs a revival, because being revived is a law of the spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVIVAL BEING THE METABOLISM<br />
OF OUR SPIRITUAL LIFE</h2>
<p>The revivals in our spiritual life have the same function as the metabolism of an animal or a plant. In both the animal life and the plant life there is a metabolic function. The ability of an organism to grow and mature depends on the law of metabolism. If the metabolic function stops, the growth of life will also stop. The continual growth of a tree also depends on the seasonal cycles of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Under normal conditions a tree needs metabolic processes in order to grow well.</p>
<p>This principle applies also to our human life, which is the highest form of the created life. Medical doctors know that every cell in the human body is completely renewed about every seven years. This renewing requires that the metabolic functions in our body operate daily; that is, new nutrients must be absorbed to supply us, and old nutrients must be discharged. The old nutrients are discharged and replaced by the new nutrients. This is metabolism. Our body grows and becomes strong through this process, which is a law of the human life.</p>
<p>If we compare what the Bible says concerning revival with the experiences of believers, we can see that the spiritual life also includes a &ldquo;metabolic&rdquo; process. This process is a cycle that is repeated continuously. In our spiritual experience there is a beginning, a course, and an ending, after which we experience another beginning with another course and another ending. This cycle repeats itself, and each repetition takes us forward. The beginning, course, and ending are a spiritual metabolism. This is also a law of revival. Every new beginning is a new revival and is followed by a course. When the course reaches its fullness, the experiences in that stage come to an end. Then another beginning will ensue with another course and another ending. This is the cycle of revival.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE LAW</h2>
<p>If we know the law, or secret, to doing something, we will have the assurance of doing it well. Revivals are not an exception. If we understand the law of revival and touch the secret to revivals, it will be easy for us to experience a revival. For example, the people in a village in northern China contracted night blindness. Later it was discovered that if they ate the liver of a certain fish, known locally as flatfish, their eyesight would be restored. From that time onward, those who were diagnosed with this disease were healed by eating the flatfish liver. Studies have shown that night blindness is due to the shortage of vitamin A in the body and that the flatfish liver is rich in vitamin A; hence, it was possible to cure the disease. This is an example of a law. As soon as this law was discovered, it was easy to cure the disease. Those who had the disease did not need to worry or fear. As long as they applied the law, they would be healed. Once a law is discovered, it is possible for help to be rendered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF NOT KNOWING THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h2>
<p>Some saints have spiritual &ldquo;night blindness.&rdquo; They are always in anguish and feel oppressed. They long to rise up, but they are unable because they have not touched the law that can cure their disease. For the last ten years we have given messages concerning the aspects of our spiritual life, but we missed the matter of revival, the law of revival. Without this teaching we have suffered much and sustained much loss. We suffer, feel oppressed, and are not released, because we neither know the law of revival, nor do we know how to apply this law.</p>
<p>Several years ago many saints entered into the pause after the end of a revival and began to feel oppressed, weak, and in darkness. When they examined their situation, however, they realized that they had not stumbled and that they were stronger in the Lord. Nevertheless, they did not sense the same sweetness, freshness, or vitality. These saints remained in this condition for more than five years and could not find a way to be released. They suffered because we had not discovered the law of revival. Even though some saints were refreshed occasionally and could rise up when they touched the Lord, the help that they received was general.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MORE REVIVALS RESULTING IN FASTER GROWTH</h2>
<p>After the end of a revival it is not necessary to experience a pause for a prolonged period of time. According to the law in our spiritual life, every revival has a course, after which there is a sense of being unsatisfied. This prepares us for a new revival. Hence, we should not feel weak and oppressed for a long time. We must remember that such feelings indicate that another revival will come. Furthermore, such feelings indicate that we need a new supply. This new supply is a revival. This is according to the law of revival.</p>
<p>Genuine growth in life is gained in the cycle of being revived, feeling unsatisfied for a period of time after the end of a revival, and then being revived again. This is also the way for our spiritual stature to increase. No matter how thorough a revival may be, it is not possible to gain every spiritual experience and become full grown in one revival. We must experience many revivals in our spiritual journey. This is the way for us to receive a fresh spiritual supply and to grow in the spiritual life. Those who do not pass through many spiritual cycles will grow slowly and will not gain much stature. In contrast, those who pass through this process many times will grow quickly and will mature.</p>
<p>In the physical realm a person needs to exercise in order to accelerate his metabolism. A person with a fast metabolism will experience proper growth and will be strong. This principle can be applied to our spiritual life. A person who passes through more cycles of being revived will grow fast. Regrettably, many saints have been in an oppressed situation for up to six years, and they have not experienced a new cycle of revival. Hence, their spiritual life is stagnant; they do not have much growth, nor are they learning new lessons. We could say that they have learned to be patient, but this may not be a genuine lesson, because even an unbeliever who is in a difficult situation for up to six years can learn to be patient without being spiritually experienced. Some saints have indeed made progress in their conduct, in the way they take care of matters, in their temperament, and in their habits. However, such progress might not be spiritual growth; it is possible that it is merely the outcome of being tried under difficult circumstances. There is a big difference between this experience and spiritual progress.</p>
<p>Genuine spiritual growth depends on the renewing of the inner life. This renewing in life is a revival. When we experience a revival, we will know and receive more spiritual things. After a period of time, what we know and have received will become old, and we will feel unsatisfied and weak. This means that it is time for us to be revived again in order to see and gain something new, that is, for the spiritual element to increase in us and for our spiritual stature to increase. Thus, another cycle will ensue, after which we will again become old and unsatisfied. Hence, we are renewed, become old, and are renewed again. Through this process we receive more spiritual elements. The new spiritual elements eliminate and swallow up some of the old elements in us. The more we are revived, the more spiritual elements will be added to us, and the more our natural elements will be swallowed up. The element of the self is discharged, and the element of God is added to us; we decrease, and the Lord increases. It is only through such a cycle of revival that we can grow.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING OURSELVES</h2>
<p>When we are in the pause after a cycle of revival, that is, when we are not satisfied, we gain a particular knowledge concerning ourselves. This is also a law. We do not see ourselves in the time of revival, because everyone who is in a revival is like a person who is drunk with wine. We become clearer when we enter into the time of being unsatisfied at the end of a revival. When a person is low, his being tends to be still. It is during this quiet time that he becomes clearer. This is true not only in spiritual matters. This principle also applies to the physical realm. When we are excited, we are not as clear about the condition of things. We tend to be optimistic and feel good about everything. When we are calm after the excitement, we become sober within and are able to see things clearly. We see the advantages and disadvantages, the benefits and the harm, the right and the wrong, and the gain and the loss.</p>
<p>For example, when two people become friends, they initially cannot see each other&rsquo;s condition clearly, because they are excited and affectionate. When the heat of the excitement dies down and they are calm, they will be able to see each other&rsquo;s weaknesses and shortcomings. Similarly, during the time of a revival, a person is unclear about himself. He may feel that he has no problems and that all is well with him. Only when he is down will he see something particular related to his condition. In other words, when we are not satisfied, our real condition is partially exposed. As a result, we feel weak or short in the matter that is exposed.</p>
<p>While a person is in a revival, he will often testify, &ldquo;I am absolutely for the Lord; I am willing to pay any price for Him. My whole being&mdash;every drop of sweat, every ounce of blood, and every cell in my body&mdash;is for the Lord. My time is for the Lord, and my money is also for the Lord. I am willing to give Him my all.&rdquo; We should not be so quick to give such a testimony. Perhaps in another six months the mood of our consecration will change. Perhaps we earn two hundred thousand dollars, and the Lord wants us to give two thousand for a particular need. We might count the two thousand dollars over and over, and eventually we give only one thousand because we feel the pain in giving. Then we realize that we cannot easily overcome money. It seems as if the Lord can ask us for anything but not our money.</p>
<p>A brother may be irritable and quick to lose his temper. Then he is revived and testifies in the meeting, &ldquo;Thank the Lord! He has delivered me from my temper. In the past weeks I encountered many trying situations in which I would have become extremely angry. But to my amazement I did not lose my temper, not even once. Praise the Lord! My temper has gone; it is a thing of the past and has been cast into the sea. I have been freed from my temper.&rdquo; This testimony is true, and it is also false. This can be compared to seeing a mirage. While playing by the sea, a person might see a city in the sky with houses and streets. We cannot say that he did not see a city, but those who understand physics know that this is a phenomenon of the refraction of light, reflecting a distant city such that it appears to be in the sky. The city looks real, but it is false. A person who is revived can be compared to a person seeing a mirage. Although he sees something, there is no reality to what he sees. He sees that his temper is over, but when the atmosphere of revival ends, and he is no longer satisfied, he will discover that his temper is more difficult to deal with than he had thought. Although he may love the Lord more, he cannot overcome his temper. This will puzzle him.</p>
<p>A person knows himself better when he is down. When a person is down, his weaknesses and problems become manifest. This can be likened to a reef near the surface of the sea. At high tide the reef is submerged in the water and cannot be seen, but at low tide the reef is visible. When we are revived, the high tide of revival covers our weaknesses, and our real condition is not visible. However, as the high tide of revival recedes, our real condition will gradually appear, and our weaknesses will be clearly manifested. If we love money, our love for money will be manifested. If we are quick-tempered, our temper will be manifested. This is a law. After a revival our real condition will be manifested, and we will see our weaknesses.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING OURSELVES IN ORDER TO<br />
EXPERIENCE CHRIST AND HAVE A REVIVAL</h2>
<p>We normally feel that our weaknesses are terrible. However, our knowledge and experience of Christ are based on the knowledge of our weaknesses. If we do not learn more concerning our weaknesses, it will be hard for us to know more concerning Christ. Hearing messages concerning Christ and reading verses in the Bible that speak of Christ will not give us genuine knowledge concerning Christ. In order to genuinely know Christ, we must first discover our weaknesses. The weaknesses that we discover will reflect a certain characteristic of Christ. We can then experience and gain Christ according to this particular characteristic. Hence, our experience and gaining of Christ depend on our knowing our weaknesses. Many Christians can testify to this fact.</p>
<p>While preaching the gospel, a brother may speak a clear word concerning the redemption of the Lord Jesus on the cross. Not everyone who hears and understands this word has a genuine knowledge of Christ, because what they hear is knowledge, theory, and doctrine; it is not genuine knowledge. The Holy Spirit must shine in a person&rsquo;s conscience and even test him so that he may see that he is corrupt and sinful and that he is a hopeless sinner. Then the Holy Spirit will enlighten him further to see that all his sins were borne by Christ on the cross. It is after this that he will truly know the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s redemption and will experience peace from the forgiveness of his sins. Hence, a person must recognize his sins in order to know and experience Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Unless we recognize our sins, the messages that we hear concerning Christ&rsquo;s redemption are useless to us. Our experience of Christ is reflected in what we know of ourselves. When we see a weakness in ourselves, we will also see a particular characteristic of Christ.</p>
<p>Let us use another example. We have heard many messages concerning Christ being our life and concerning Christ having the power of resurrection, but these truths may be mere doctrine to us. One day the Lord will bring us to the point that we are surrounded and besieged by mountains and hills in our environment. Instead of there being a smooth highway before us, we will be faced with obstructions and will be pressed beyond our power within and without. This situation may last for several years. Then one day, when we are in a low and deadened condition, we may hear a message concerning the resurrected and transcendent Christ, who is not held by death but rather has broken through death. Although we may have heard such a message before, it did not have any effect on us because we lacked knowledge of our condition and of Christ&rsquo;s characteristics. This time, however, we realize that Christ has indeed broken through death, has ascended, is exalted, and is transcendent over everything. When we begin to know this aspect of Christ, we are released and transcendent, and we enter into a new revival.</p>
<p>We must remember that a revival is not a once-for-all experience. Every revival will come to an end, and we will again enter a time of being unsatisfied. However, during the time of being unsatisfied, we will discover another natural condition; that is, we recognize another natural weakness. This weakness will cause us to see a certain characteristic of Christ and experience Christ in this characteristic. Thus, we will again be revived and will know, experience, and gain more of Christ. The more we are revived, the more we will know Christ. If we stop being revived, our knowledge of Christ will also stop.</p>
<p>Hence, it is good that we have weaknesses, for our weaknesses enable us to see the characteristics of Christ. It is difficult for us to know the characteristics of Christ if we do not know our own weaknesses. We discover our weaknesses after a revival. At such a time our heart is downcast, and there is a matching difficult environment, which is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. These cause us to gain a deeper knowledge of ourselves. The Holy Spirit often raises up a special situation in our environment to coordinate with His discipline so that we can discover our weaknesses or our problems. What we see becomes a kind of reflection that enables us to see a particular characteristic of Christ that can deal with our weakness. When we see and receive this characteristic, we will immediately be revived.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h2>
<p>If we are skillful in the application of the law of revival, it will not be difficult for us to be revived. It will be unnecessary for us to remain in a state of oppression for a long time. Whenever we feel oppressed, we will see a weakness in ourselves, and this weakness will enable us to see an aspect of Christ. Then we can be revived again. This corresponds to Paul&rsquo;s word in 2 Corinthians 12: &ldquo;Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me...For when I am weak, then I am powerful&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). We will be able to say, &ldquo;When I am low, then I am soaring; when I am suffering, then I am rejoicing; and when I lose my temper, then I am gentle.&rdquo; If being quick-tempered is our weakness, this weakness will be manifested when we are low. Once this weakness is manifested, we can receive Christ as our patience. We should not continually look at our weaknesses, for they are manifested so that through them we would see Christ.</p>
<p>The problem with many saints is that they look only at their weaknesses, and as a result, they collapse. I once told a brother not to ask the saints to sing the hymn &ldquo;O Lord, Shine and Shine on Me&rdquo; (hymn #326 in Chinese). The saints do not need to look at themselves, nor do they need more shining, because they are not able to rise up. If the members in a Christian group are confused, quarreling, and fleshy, then they will need to sing, &ldquo;O Lord, shine and shine on me.&rdquo; Among us, however, some saints know that they are fleshly, in the self, and cold toward the Lord; hence, they do not need to look at their weaknesses. The more they look at themselves, the more incompetent they will feel, and the colder they will become. We cannot rise up, because we do not apply the law of revival.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should never stay focused on our weaknesses. The weaknesses that we discover should only enable us to see an aspect of Christ for us to experience. When we gaze upon Christ, who is newly revealed to us in a particular characteristic, we will be enlivened within and revived. After we experience Christ in this way, we will not care about our weaknesses. Instead, we will look directly at our goal, the Christ who is able to supply us richly in all things and solve all our problems. Then we will be revived and experience another cycle of revival. When we see a weakness, we should immediately look at Christ. Then we will experience another revival. This is the law of revival. If we see this law clearly, whenever we are down and discover a weakness, we can receive Christ according to our weakness and enter into a new revival.</p>
<p>We do not need to beg in order to be revived. We only need to know the law of revival and apply this law. Whenever we see a weakness, we should simply receive Christ according to the need that has been revealed, and our inner being will rise up. This is a revival. Revivals do not last long; they come to an end. Then we see ourselves again and also see Christ; thus, we have yet another revival.</p>
<p>Therefore, feeling low, down, or oppressed is not something bad; it is a necessary process. But we should not linger too long in this state. The weakness that we see in ourselves should cause us to see something of Christ, which will be a new element to supply us, and we will have yet another revival. Those who exercise to be revived in this way will grow continually in Christ. Their stature in Christ will increase, the spiritual element will increase within them, and they will put off the self. It is through the repeated cycles of the law of revival that we can continue to grow and advance spiritually.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h1>
<p>According to the divine revelation, revival is a law in the spiritual life of a Christian by which we can grow gradually in the Lord. Having this realization will help us to experience God as life. In this chapter we will consider how to apply the law of revival continually.</p>
<p>Although many saints attend the various meetings of the church, the saints are not living. They sit in the meetings with long faces and do not open their mouths to pray or to say Amen when others pray. Spiritually speaking, they look as if they have not had enough food, water, or sleep. If they are always down spiritually, this indicates that there is a problem.</p>
<p>The reason many saints go for a long time without eating, drinking, or sleeping spiritually is that they do not adequately know the law of revival. Hence, they do not apply this law continually. Our living is not disciplined, because we neither understand nor live according to this law. A person who is disciplined is healthy, because he has regular times for eating and sleeping. We need to maintain a disciplined living in our spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF THE PHYSICAL LIFE</h2>
<p>Every human being knows that our physical life operates according to a law and that man must live according to this law. According to the law of our physical life, we must sleep eight hours, eat three times a day in the morning, afternoon, and evening, and drink an adequate amount of water. We may also need two or three snacks daily. These items are indispensable. When we live according to this law for a long period of time, these items are developed into our habit and become a discipline. For example, we sleep not only because we are worn out and cannot stay awake any longer. Most people must go to bed at a certain time, whether or not they are sleepy. This is a disciplined living. This discipline is established gradually according to the needs of our physical life.</p>
<p>Similarly, after we wake up in the morning, we must eat a meal whether or not we are hungry. Our eating a meal in the morning is not based on our feeling; it is according to discipline. Those who are disciplined not only eat at fixed times but also eat a fixed amount. They do not eat more when they feel like eating or eat less when they do not feel like it. Whether or not they feel like it, they eat the same amount of food. This is a disciplined living. In the afternoon they will eat another meal, and in the evening they will eat again. Then around ten o&rsquo;clock they will go to bed and sleep until the morning. In the morning they rise and eat another meal. We are not forced to do these activities, nor are these activities based on our feelings. These activities are based on a law. If we live a disciplined life according to this law, we will have normal growth and be strong.</p>
<p>The result of eating, drinking, and sleeping is a revival. Even if we are very tired at night, we will be restored and refreshed in the morning after we get up, wash, and eat breakfast. Being restored is a revival. Then after four hours of expending our energy, the revival ends, and we feel tired and fatigued by noon. Therefore, we eat lunch and take a nap in order to be restored again. This is another revival. We then go through another process, and the revival ends in the evening. Hence, we feel tired and need to eat another meal. After eating, we are restored and refreshed again, and we are full of energy when we go to the meeting. This is another revival. After a few hours of activity, we are tired; hence, we go to sleep at night. When we rise up in the morning, we have another revival.</p>
<p>According to the above example, adequate sleep, eating, and drinking issue in a revival. A revival involves a beginning, a course, and an ending. After the ending of a revival, we sleep, eat, and drink once more and are revived yet again. As this cycle continues, we are continually revived.</p>
<p>It is rather easy for us to experience a daily revival in the physical realm. Feeling tired is a sign that tells us we should sleep, feeling hungry is a sign that tells us we should eat, and feeling thirsty is a sign that tells us we should drink. When we have adequate sleep, food, and water, we experience a revival. After a while we will feel tired, hungry, and thirsty again, meaning that it is time for us to sleep, eat, and drink in order to begin another revival. The revivals in the physical realm are not once for all. They involve a beginning that is followed by a course and then an ending. After the ending we need another revival. The ability of our physical life to exist, grow, and become strong is dependent on the cycle of revivals. This is a law of the physical life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A DISCIPLINED SPIRITUAL LIVING</h2>
<p>The physical life is often a clear picture of our spiritual life. If we know the law of our physical life and are disciplined to live according to this law, we will be healthy. However, we must admit that we do not adequately understand the law of our spiritual life. For this reason, our spiritual life is not disciplined. Even though we may not strictly live a disciplined life physically, we still have energy in the morning, afternoon, and evening. In other words, we continue to have revivals throughout the day. With regard to our spiritual life, however, we often feel down when we meet and serve, because we do not adequately know the law of revival. This is a serious problem.</p>
<p>I once asked a brother concerning his spiritual condition. He replied, &ldquo;My condition is poor. For three weeks my spirit has not been able to rise up.&rdquo; His condition was the result of his wife being sick. I also asked a sister concerning her condition, and she replied, &ldquo;I do not know what to do. Every month our income cannot cover our expenses.&rdquo; Quite a few brothers and sisters are in the same situation. Figuratively speaking, I do not often see a saint who has had enough sleep, food, and water, that is, one who is invigorated and revived. Rather, the saints are often downcast, dry, stale, deadened, suffering, and pressed down. These conditions are the issue of not having adequate sleep, food, and water. Some saints have been in this condition for several years; they always feel pressed down and weak. Their conscience bothers them if they do not come to the meeting, but they cannot touch anything in the meeting. Their conscience bothers them if they do not serve, but they are overburdened. It is not reasonable for a Christian to be pressed down for years. This situation is not right, but many saints are in this situation because they do not know the law of revival and, hence, do not live a disciplined spiritual life.</p>
<p>If someone says that he is tired and does not have strength because he has not slept well for three years, we would be shocked and ask him why he has not slept well. Likewise, if a person cries because he is hungry and thirsty, we would ask him why he does not eat or drink. Hunger and thirst are signs, telling us to eat and drink. If we refuse to eat and drink, our tears are useless. Christ is dwelling in us, and He is our eternal food and the fountain of living water. We do not eat or drink Him, because we do not know the law of revival, and we do not live a disciplined life. We do not know that we should eat Him when we are hungry, drink Him when we are thirsty, and rest in Him when we are tired. We know the law of our physical life and live according to it; hence, we sleep when we are tired, eat when we are hungry, and drink when we are thirsty. However, we are weary, hungry, dry, low, old, dead, and miserable because we do not know the law of our spiritual life. It is unnecessary for us to be in this condition.</p>
<p>Most Christians have an improper understanding concerning the law of revival. They think that a person needs to be revived only after he has committed a sin or has backslidden. Our spiritual life grows through repeated revivals. Eating, drinking, and sleeping cause our physical life to grow. Similarly, our spiritual life grows by eating, drinking, and sleeping, that is, by our being revived. In the physical realm being thirsty is a sign for us to drink, being hungry is a sign for us to eat, and being tired is a sign for us to sleep. Because we understand the law of our physical life, we drink when we are thirsty, eat when we are hungry, and sleep when we are tired. As a result, we are revived. However, we do not understand the law of our spiritual life. Hence, we do not drink when we are thirsty, we do not eat when we are hungry, nor do we sleep when we are tired. Instead, we lament and sigh.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the saints never have adequate food, water, or sleep. Sometimes they get enough food, water, and sleep, but this is not a regular occurrence. For example, a brother who has been thirsty for several months will occasionally take a drink and be so happy that he will praise and testify in the meeting. However, we are not revived regularly, nor do we have the assurance of being revived, because we do not know the law of revival, and we do not live a disciplined life according to this law.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE NEEDING<br />
BIG AND SMALL REVIVALS</h2>
<p>If we know the law of revival, we will contact the Lord as soon as we feel oppressed. When we contact Him, our inner being will rise up and be revived. When we feel old, we simply need to contact the Lord again. As soon as we touch Him, we will be refreshed and experience a revival. If we would touch the Lord when we feel hungry, tired, weary, dry, old, or dead, we would always have a revival. We would have big revivals and small revivals. We would also have several revivals in one day. Furthermore, as a result of such frequent revivals, we would grow quickly; we would advance according to the law of life. </p>
<p>In the physical realm there are four seasons in a year, which form a cycle. Every spring is a big beginning, a big revival. There are three hundred sixty-five days in a year, and every day is a small cycle. Hence, every morning is a small beginning, a small revival. Furthermore, the three meals that we eat within the twenty-four hours of one day are also small revivals. Besides these revivals, sleeping and resting are also small revivals. By means of these continuous cycles of big and small revivals, our physical life can exist, grow, and become strong.</p>
<p>This principle also applies to our spiritual life. There are also big revivals and small revivals in our spiritual life. For example, when we were saved, we were raised out of death and received God&rsquo;s life. This was a big revival. When we forsook our past and gave ourselves to the Lord, we had another big revival. Through such big revivals we are filled with joy and feel as though we are soaring in heaven. When we lose this feeling after a period of time, it is time for a revival that will deliver us from living according to our feelings to living by faith and that will enable us to enter deeper into the Lord. Such a revival is a big revival. Hence, a Christian has at least three big revivals: salvation, consecration, and deliverance from living according to his feelings into living by faith.</p>
<p>Besides the big revivals, we also have many small revivals in our daily life. For example, if a sister receives a telegram that her mother is gravely ill, the sister will be down. But if she knows the law of revival, she will realize that such a feeling is a sign, urging her to contact Christ, look at Him, experience Him, and gain Him. As soon as she experiences Christ in this way, she will be uplifted. This is a small revival. Here is another example. A brother may feel hurt because a colleague at work said something sarcastic and mocked him. This feeling is a sign, telling him to contact Christ, cast this burden on Him, and enjoy Him in this matter. If the brother will experience Christ in this way, he will immediately have a small revival. We can be revived at least three times a day: in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening.</p>
<p>In addition to the situations in our outward environment, we also have situations that involve our heart. A sister may always have sweet fellowship with the Lord, but one morning the fellowship is blocked, and the sweet taste disappears. As a result, she will feel very sad. This feeling is a sign, telling her to seek a revival. This feeling should also cause her to see a weakness, which will lead her to know a virtue of Christ. Our weaknesses expose what we lack of His virtues. Hence, we can enjoy Christ according to our weaknesses. This is a revival. We can experience such revivals many times in a day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE LAW OF REVIVAL<br />
ENABLING US TO BE REVIVED EASILY</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:10 the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;I am well pleased in weaknesses...; for when I am weak, then I am powerful.&rdquo; Paul knew how to live by the power of Christ when he was weak and how to touch the joy of Christ when he suffered. He also was able to apply the law of revival; hence, he was always being revived. We need to know and apply this law so that we too can regularly experience being revived. This is the way to be saved from being weighed down by our problems.</p>
<p>A brother might stop attending the meetings because the burden of his children&rsquo;s problems, his wife&rsquo;s poor health, and his financial situation is too heavy for him to bear. On the one hand, we sympathize with his situation. On the other hand, we cannot justify his action, because the Christ who dwelt in Paul also dwells in him. Paul said, &ldquo;When I am weak, then I am powerful&rdquo;; therefore, this brother should be able to say the same thing. If this brother knows the law of the spiritual life, he also will be able to say that he is powerful when he is weak. The Lord has permitted his environment to serve as a sign that he needs another revival. He does not need to plead for a revival. Instead, he needs to see that the Lord who indwells him is resurrection and is full of power; the Lord is able to break through death. This brother needs to see, believe, and accept this fact. Then he will even be able to say to Satan, &ldquo;If you create more sufferings and stir up more problems, I will be able to enjoy more of Christ. When I am weighed down, then I am released; when I am weak, then I am strong; when I am in misery, then I am full of joy.&rdquo; This brother will be revived when he sees Christ. Even if the means of his livelihood are not stable, the environment will not frustrate him from being in the meetings. On the contrary, when he comes to the meetings, he will be full of vitality, released in spirit, and his whole being will be buoyant and elated. He will be able to testify, even if in tears, of how the Lord visits him and is with him in his difficult situation. We may say that this is the testimony of a person who has met and enjoyed the Lord, but this is actually the testimony of a person who has experienced another revival.</p>
<p>If we know the law of revival, being revived will be a simple matter. We do not need to be weighed down or oppressed until, being unable to bear it any longer, we pray desperately and touch the Lord accidentally before we can rise up. We need only to know this law and know that the Lord is dwelling in us with all His riches. Whenever we feel deadened, weighed down, or oppressed, or when we suffer the attack of our environment, we should draw on the Lord&rsquo;s great power, and we will be revived immediately. As long as we know the law of revival, it will not be difficult to eat when we are hungry or to drink when we are thirsty.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT REMAINING WEAK OR OPPRESSED</h2>
<p>In the New Testament age Christ is everything to us. If we are down, He is in ascension; if we are deadened, He is resurrection; if we are weak, He is strong; and if we are in darkness, He is light. Every weakness that we possess enables us to see a particular virtue of Christ. He can meet the need in every weakness. Hence, as Christians, we have no reason to be continually miserable. We should rejoice when we are miserable. Neither do we have any reason to stay weak for a long time; we should be strong when we are weak. Figuratively speaking, there is no reason for us to hunger continually. If there were a famine that issued in a shortage of food, we would have reason to be hungry. But we have an abundance of food; the resurrected Christ dwells in us to supply our every need. Therefore, we should no longer be hungry. We have no reason to sigh or lament, because we can eat when we are hungry.</p>
<p>We have no reason to be deadened in the meetings, because when we are deadened, then we are enlivened. Paul said that when he was weak, then he was powerful. Being weak includes feeling miserable, oppressed, weighed down, or deadened, being closed and in darkness, and every other negative condition. Similarly, being powerful includes being joyful, bright, uplifted, released, living, open, and every other positive condition. Hence, the principle of &ldquo;when I am weak, then I am powerful&rdquo; can be applied to all our situations.</p>
<p>In the past we explained how to live by faith, how to enjoy the riches of Christ, how to eat, drink, and enjoy God, and how to fellowship with the Lord and live in this fellowship, but we neglected the law of revival. The Lord is presently leading us to see that the proper spiritual living involves the law of revival, the cycle of revival. The more we are revived, the more we will be fresh, living, strong, open, and mature.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO KNOW AND APPLY<br />
THE LAW OF REVIVAL</h2>
<p>Sometimes we sense a need for revival even though our spiritual life is advancing smoothly. We may sense that we have become old. This is a sign that we need to be renewed and revived. For example, a brother may sense a lack in the messages that he gives. This sense is a sign that he needs a new beginning in relation to giving messages. A sister who was supplied when she read the Bible may lose the sense of satisfaction. This sense of dissatisfaction is also a sign, requiring that she be revived in relation to reading the Bible.</p>
<p>Besides the conditions within us, the Lord has arranged for the discipline of the Holy Spirit to create different situations in our environment to force us to sense the need for a revival. We might be disheartened by the news we receive, or we may be troubled by a word of misunderstanding or by problems in our family, among the saints, or in the work. These are all signs that we need a new revival. We may quote the Lord&rsquo;s words in Matthew 11:28: &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; However, this verse may be merely doctrine to us, because we have no experience of it. But when the Holy Spirit works in our environment, there may be heavy burdens pressing upon us. These burdens indicate that we need to enjoy and experience Christ again. These burdens also reveal that Christ is our rest. By receiving such a Christ and enjoying His rest by faith, we will be revived again.</p>
<p>In the past we said that when there is a new situation in our environment, we should immediately hand the problem over to the Lord. But we need to see that it is not merely a matter of handing our problem over to the Lord; rather, it is a matter of experiencing the law of revival in our spiritual life. Some people tend to remain in whatever problem they encounter instead of being revived by contacting and experiencing the Lord. Remaining in our problems means that we do not know the law of revival. We know the law of revival in the physical realm, and we spontaneously live by this law: we are revived by eating when we are hungry and drinking when we are thirsty. However, in the spiritual realm we do not eat when we are hungry, nor do we drink when we are thirsty. Instead of contacting the Lord when problems arise, we sigh, lament our situation, and suffer a great loss.</p>
<p>May God enable us to see the law of revival and to apply this law so that we would be delivered from the self into Christ. The more we experience the cycle of revival, the more our element will decrease, and the element of Christ will increase. This is the way for us to grow and be strong. Furthermore, in spite of our environment, we will be living and fresh, that is, revived.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING OPEN IN ORDER TO ENLIVEN OTHERS</h2>
<p>We should also learn to be open. After being revived and living, we should not be closed. Rather, we should remain open so that there would be a flow between us and the other saints. We should let living water flow out from us into others and receive the living water that flows out from others. The more we flow out, the more we will have the inflow. As a result, we will be enlivened, and others also will be enlivened.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters have listened to many messages, but they still are not living. Hence, we do not need more messages. We need to enliven the saints, but we must first be enlivened before we can enliven others. When everyone is enlivened, we will be able to advance. We must not hold on to routines, meeting and serving according to old ways and old forms. We have to &ldquo;overturn&rdquo; the saints until they are enlivened. There is no regulation for us to follow; we simply need to enliven the saints one by one. The saints simply need to come together in order to enliven one another. Those taking the lead must be the first to be living; then they can enliven the other saints. This is crucial. Our being enlivened depends on our knowing the law of revival and regularly applying this law. Then we can be revived moment by moment, and our condition will always be fresh and living.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">KNOWING THE LORD&rsquo;S RESURRECTION<br />
THROUGH BEING BROKEN</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES<br />
OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING TO BE BROKEN</h2>
<p>In the secular world people know that a person&rsquo;s ideal condition often differs from his real situation. This can also be applied to spiritual matters. Believers who seek and follow the Lord eventually discover that there is often a substantial difference between their real condition and the condition that they desire. Very few believers have learned the lessons or have been worked on by the Lord. Few can testify that since the day of their salvation there have not been any problems in their pursuit of the Lord, that they have accomplished what they want, or that they have arrived at the spiritual condition they desire. The biographies of spiritual believers reveal that their experiences were primarily of being broken.</p>
<p>Let us consider the matter of reading the Bible. After salvation or after being revived, many believers make a vow to read the Bible every day. They even consider which method they should use to complete the Bible in a year. Their plan is ideal. However, very few believers are able to achieve their ideal plan, and when they do, there does not seem to be much benefit. In contrast, those who can read the Bible properly experience being broken in their reading. They desire to read the Bible diligently, but God arranges many situations in their environment that interrupt them. They have an earnest desire to set aside several hours a day to read the Bible, but God arranges unavoidable circumstances, such as a brother seeking help because of a family problem or a sister coming for fellowship because she is unhappy with her husband, not to mention their own problems. These situations make it impossible for them to fulfill their desire in reading the Bible. They can read only a short portion of the Bible and ponder over it briefly in the midst of their chaos. I can testify that reading the Bible in this way often issues in special enlightenment from God and yields unexpected results. However, those who are able to read the Bible according to their plan may not receive any light. They might become well versed in the Bible, but they are dead. Those who can receive light from reading the Bible often experience being broken.</p>
<p>This principle applies not only to reading the Bible but also to prayer and to other spiritual activities. This principle also applies to the Lord&rsquo;s work and to the church. We can say that the history of the church is a matter of being broken. Such experiences, however, issue in genuine growth in life.</p>
<p>Bible expositors have highly appraised the church at Pentecost. They consider the early church to have been blameless and faultless. As far as God&rsquo;s work is concerned, there was no problem, but the church experienced serious problems. For example, in Acts 1 through 4 the condition of the church was wonderful, but in chapter 5 something negative occurred&mdash;Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, lied to the Holy Spirit (vv. 1-11). In this portion even though the morning had just begun, it seemed as though the sun had begun to set. Then in chapter 6 complaints arose because of the distribution of food (vv. 1-2). Hence, the church at Pentecost was not so spiritual or so good. Whatever God does is good, but our situations are not ideal, because we must be tried and broken in order to become dependable. This applies to the church and to the individual believers.</p>
<p>The condition of the church at Pentecost can be compared to an unfired clay brick with a newly painted pattern. The pattern must be burned onto the brick by passing through fire. God did a work of grace in the early church and provided it with a wonderful situation. Soon afterward the church passed through a great trial; it went through a &ldquo;furnace&rdquo; in order to be broken. God supplied the church with grace, and He allowed the church to be tried. However, the church failed and became desolate. Hence, the apostle Paul, who preached the gospel to the Gentile world, said that all who were in Asia had turned away from him (2 Tim. 1:15). This shows how desolate the church had become.</p>
<p>According to its outward condition, the church had become worse than it was at Pentecost. But according to its intrinsic nature, the church at the time of Pentecost was inferior to the church at the time of Paul&rsquo;s rejection.</p>
<p>This principle can be applied to our present situation. For example, a local church that is flourishing and thriving in the beginning of the year may fall because of two small problems in the second half of the year and never recover its initial condition. However, according to its intrinsic nature, the condition of this church may be stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING BROKEN IN ORDER TO BE PURIFIED</h2>
<p>God often allows an individual believer or even a church to stumble and be broken. God first adorns us, and then He breaks us. He first equips us, and then He lets us pass through the furnace. He first revives us, and then He tries us. Sometimes the breaking, burning, and trying are in the form of external persecutions and attacks, and at other times they are in the form of internal disputes and discord. We cannot say that a church or a brother in these circumstances has fallen. We must remember that although the outward condition may be bad, the intrinsic nature is being purified and built up.</p>
<p>The individual believers and the church are filled with mixture even though they are being revived. This mixture includes everything of the natural man, such as our feelings, interests, preferences, disposition, and pleasures. Even though a revival is the work of the Holy Spirit, it is mixed with the human element. Hence, God gives us grace for us to rise up, and He also breaks us in order to purify us. God knows our measure, and He knows how to break us; He is not severe. We may feel that we are about to die under God&rsquo;s breaking, but He knows how much breaking we need. The breaking will neither be too heavy nor too light. We may feel as if we are dead, but we are not, for He will enliven us again. After we are made alive, He will give us another revival, in which we will think that we are doing well. We do not realize that there is still much mixture in us and that God must break us yet again. We must understand that we are filled with mixture and, hence, require God&rsquo;s repeated breaking.</p>
<p>A brother once testified that while he was traveling, he saw a mountain range and was reminded of Christ&rsquo;s position in creation. This caused a sense of reverence to rise up in his heart. At the same time, however, a sense of pride also rose up in him, and he began to consider how commendable it was for him to be the first to receive such a revelation and vision concerning Christ in creation. This shows how easy it is for the human element to be manifested. Let us consider this example. God in His mercy visited this brother and caused him to remember and touch Christ while sightseeing. But the brother became proud and considered himself to be important. This example exposes the mixture in us.</p>
<p>We need to be tried because we are filled with mixture. We are so full of mixture that we do not know ourselves. We have no idea how much mixture there is in our motive, intention, aim, will, and inclination and in what we desire to achieve and gain. Our mixture needs trials in order to be exposed so that we may be purified. To be tried is to be purified.</p>
<p>It is not simple to be purified; we cannot be purified through one trial. After a trial we may think that our mixture has been removed, but after two years it is still present. It is even possible for something that we think has been removed to still be present after twenty years. Those who have learned some lessons know what their problems are when they pass through trials. For example, Abraham lied when he went down to Egypt (Gen. 12:9-20). Later he returned to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, and he called on the name of Jehovah (13:1-4), but the element of lying was still in him. Hence, when the circumstance arose again, he lied again (ch. 20). However, he was different; his first failure left a mark that caused him to somewhat know himself.</p>
<p>We cannot gain spiritual stature from one experience. We experience salvation once, but every other spiritual matter is not experienced only once. God first equips us, and then He tries us. He first gives us grace and then breaks us. This cycle occurs again and again. When we are in the process, we feel miserable and dejected. We fail in one matter and fall short in another. When our condition improves slightly, we fail again; when our work has a result, a storm blows away the issue of our toil. We may have labored in a local church for seven years, but suddenly trouble arises, and we suffer loss and are in anguish. We must remember that this process is necessary.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING THE REVELATION OF RESURRECTION<br />
IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF DEATH</h2>
<p>In the book of Philippians Paul wrote, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death&rdquo; (3:10). He did not write this in Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, or any other Epistle. When Paul wrote Romans, he was busy traveling, and when he wrote 1 and 2 Corinthians, his work was spreading. When we are busy and our work is spreading, we cannot sense the need to know the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. The apostle Paul was not an exception. It was not until he was put into prison and was in bonds, like a grain of wheat that is buried in the ground, that he sensed the deep need to know Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. He realized that he needed the revelation of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>At this time Paul could write the Epistle to the Philippians concerning his pursuing to know resurrection by being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death. At this point he was put into an environment of death. In principle, his prison was his tomb. Paul could not endure this environment by himself. Hence, in the depths of his being he sensed his need to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and to be conformed to His death.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE IN SONG OF SONGS<br />
PROGRESSING FROM FEELING TO REVELATION</h2>
<p>We need to consider the vision in Song of Songs. The experience in Song of Songs is progressive. The experiences of the maiden, who represents the Lord&rsquo;s seeker, go higher and deeper step by step. Not only so, she grows step by step. In the beginning her beloved praises her as a mare among Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots (1:9). This means that even though she was swift to pursue her beloved, she used her natural strength. This strength must be dealt with. For this reason, her beloved says, &ldquo;We will make you plaits of gold / With studs of silver&rdquo; (v. 11). Studs of silver signify the killing work of the cross, and plaits of gold signify the constituting work of the Holy Spirit. The killing work of the cross and the constituting work of the Holy Spirit gradually transform us from being natural to being spiritual.</p>
<p>In verse 15 the maiden is praised: &ldquo;Your eyes are like doves.&rdquo; This signifies being single in her desire for her beloved. In chapter 2 she is like a lily (v. 2), and in chapter 3 she is like pillars of smoke (v. 6). These indicate that she is gradually ascending. She is also praised as a palanquin for Solomon (v. 9). In chapter 6 she is &ldquo;as terrible as an army with banners,&rdquo; which means that she is strong and victorious (v. 4). She is also &ldquo;as beautiful as the moon&rdquo; and &ldquo;as clear as the sun,&rdquo; which means that she is bright, solid, and transcendent, living in a heavenly realm (v. 10). The maiden has risen to this heavenly realm from Egypt (1:9). Not only so, she is also as beautiful as Tirzah and as lovely as Jerusalem, which indicates that she has grown into a built-up city (3:4). This is the process of her growth.</p>
<p>Her experience and knowledge of her beloved are also progressive. Chapter 1 begins with her saying that his love is better than wine (v. 2). In verse 12 she is at the table with her beloved. Because she has his presence and enjoys his abundance, she says, &ldquo;My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh,&rdquo; indicating that he is fragrant within her (v. 13). She also says, &ldquo;My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers,&rdquo; indicating that he is her beauty (v. 14). In chapter 2 she enters deeper into her beloved&rsquo;s presence and enjoys him in his banqueting house (v. 4). She compares him to an apple tree: &ldquo;In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste&rdquo; (v. 3). Here she fully enjoys his sweetness. In the beginning her feeling of love toward her beloved is not solid or concrete. When she compares him to myrrh and henna flowers, her feeling is a little more solid and a little more concrete. Later, when she says that he is like an apple tree under which she can sit down and enjoy the sweetness of its fruit, she has been perfected by her beloved.</p>
<p>In the beginning of her seeking, the maiden asks, &ldquo;Tell me... Where do you pasture your flock? / Where do you make it lie down at noon?&rdquo; (1:7). In chapter 2 she not only finds her beloved; she is under his shade, his covering, and enjoys his presence (vv. 3-6). How satisfied and restful she is! Up until this point, her words issue from the experience of her enjoyment, and her knowledge is mainly based on what she has enjoyed.</p>
<p>In the second stage of her experience, her knowledge of her beloved changes. In verses 8 and 9 the maiden says, &ldquo;Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills. / My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart.&rdquo; This is a special vision. Formerly, she said that her beloved was like myrrh, henna flowers, and an apple tree. These are an expression of her feelings in her enjoyment; they are not a revelation or a vision. Now her beloved comes to give her a vision. Hence, it is no longer a matter of enjoyment but of power and vitality. We need to see that the Lord is full of resurrection power and that He comes leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills like a young hart full of vigor and vitality. No mountain or hill can hold Him back. At this stage a seeker&rsquo;s knowledge of the Lord has progressed from enjoyment to seeing and from feeling to revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FURTHER REVELATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Lord&rsquo;s Resurrection</h2>
<p>The saints in the church life do not have sufficient light and revelation concerning the Lord. They know the Lord mainly according to the feelings realized in their experiences. Such knowledge reaches its fullness in experiencing the Lord as an apple tree. Many saints say, &ldquo;O Lord, Your love is better than wine. Draw me, and I will run after You. I want to be satisfied and have Your presence.&rdquo; They have indeed enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s presence and tasted His sweetness. They can also say from their experience that the Lord is like myrrh within and henna flowers without. Some can also testify that they have enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness, received His protection, and tasted the rich fruit in His shade. Many saints can give such a testimony. However, very few have received a revelation, a vision, of the Lord coming like a young hart full of vigor, leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills.</p>
<p>The Lord wants to give us a new vision. He wants us not only to experience His sweetness and enjoy His riches; He wants us to see His resurrection, to see that He is the hind of the dawn. He bore our sins on the cross, was forsaken by God, and entered into resurrection to be the hind of the dawn (Psa. 22 title). The Lord is calling us to see that He, as the hind of the dawn, is full of vigor and vitality and is coming to us. He is leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills. In Song of Songs the beloved says to the maiden, &ldquo;Rise up...and come away; / For now the winter is past; / The rain is over and gone. / Flowers appear on the earth; / The time of singing has come, / And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land&rdquo; (2:10-12). This indicates that the Lord is leading us to see the vision of resurrection and is bringing us out of our personal spiritual experience and enjoyment so that we may go forward with Him in resurrection. This is the Lord&rsquo;s call to us today.</p><h2 class="head2">Experiencing Death<br />
in Order to Know Resurrection</h2>
<p>We must experience death in order to know the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. Paul was spiritual, but he also needed to experience many sufferings, including prison. To be in prison signifies the bondage and restriction that make it impossible for us to be as free as we were previously. Formerly, we had &ldquo;wings&rdquo; and could fly wherever we wanted without any restrictions. Now, however, the Lord has put us in a prison under restriction. To be in prison has broad implications. We are in prison when we are down or when our spirit cannot rise. These experiences are necessary, for it is while we are in prison that we experience the Lord&rsquo;s death and the power of His resurrection. The suffering in prison is not merely outward persecution or difficulties; it is a spiritual killing that will put to death the natural elements in us so that we may be delivered from the self and conformed to His death. The Lord&rsquo;s death is a mold that puts to death all that belongs to us and resurrects all that belongs to Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord places us in the prison of trials, He gives us a vision of Himself as a gazelle and a young hart. We may be imprisoned behind walls, but He is not obstructed by mountains or hills, because He leaps on the mountains and skips on the hills. When He shows us this vision, He calls us to rise up and come away with Him because the winter is past and the rain is over (v. 11). This means that death is gone. According to our feeling, we are still in death, but He says, &ldquo;All the things of death are over and gone, so you must rise up and come away with Me.&rdquo; This is resurrection. Hence, when Paul wrote the book of Philippians in prison, he repeatedly said that he rejoiced, and he exhorted the believers to rejoice in the Lord also (2:17-18; 4:4). Paul was transcendent. He was not bound by the environment on the earth, because he knew resurrection, and he knew how to apply resurrection power to his suffering of imprisonment. The suffering of imprisonment, on the one hand, caused Paul&rsquo;s natural elements to be put to death and, on the other hand, caused all the elements of God to be lived out from within Paul. This is to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Conformed to Christ&rsquo;s Death</h2>
<p>In order to make a cake, the dough must be pressed into a mold. Then the dough will have the same form as the mold. The death of the Lord Jesus is a mold, and our person and our living are the dough. God places us in all kinds of environments to &ldquo;mold&rdquo; us until we are conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death. To be in the form of the Lord&rsquo;s death means that everything of man, including that which is bad and also that which is good, has to die. When the Lord Jesus became a man, He put on the God-created humanity. His humanity was not bad. Nevertheless, it needed to be put to death. Through His death the things of man were crucified, and the things of God were brought forth. Hence, some things will be terminated through death, but other things will come out of death. The mold of the death of the Lord Jesus has these two aspects.</p>
<p>Our experience of the Lord&rsquo;s death also has these two aspects. As descendants of Adam, we have both his God-created humanity and his fallen and sinful human element. However, we also have God&rsquo;s element because we are regenerated. By His mercy we need to experience many revivals, have many new beginnings, because we are still full of mixture. Hence, the Lord needs to remove the unclean and improper fallen things of Adam, and He also needs to put to death the good and proper things of our God-created humanity.</p>
<p>A person cannot be put to death by merely enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s love, His abundance, or His sweetness, that is, by knowing Him as &ldquo;a bundle of myrrh&rdquo; and &ldquo;a cluster of henna flowers&rdquo; or by taking Him as &ldquo;the apple tree.&rdquo; On the contrary, the more a person touches the Lord&rsquo;s love and enjoys His sweetness in these ways, the more the element of the self is present. Therefore, the Lord must change the environment and put us into trials, into &ldquo;prisons,&rdquo; such as health problems, family problems, problems in the work, changes in the arrangement among the co-workers, or turmoils in the church. Initially, the believers in Asia welcomed Paul, but eventually they all turned away from him (2 Tim. 1:15). This turning away was more severe than the Roman prison. But it was for Paul to experience being broken and thereby know the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>Our spiritual experiences are not according to our desire. It is difficult to find a person who loves the Lord at a young age, who has good health and mental prowess, who advances speedily in every aspect, and who later marries a spiritual spouse and has children who are like Samuel or Timothy, being obedient, intelligent, seeking to be spiritual, having morning watch at the age of seven, reading the Bible with understanding at the age of eight, and knowing how to fellowship with the Lord at the age of nine. Such a child would be ideal, perfect. However, this is all wishful thinking. Similarly, we should not expect that our work will always be effective, that our co-workers will always be in one accord, or that the church under our care will always be prosperous. These are what we desire, but they are never fulfilled.</p>
<p>Our experience is always one of being broken. We may become sick for no reason, and our health may not improve. We may also discover that our spiritual spouse is not spiritual. We may also discover that our child is foolish when we expect him to be intelligent, is mischievous when we expect him to be obedient, and does not love the Lord when we expect him to be spiritual. We may also experience many situations in the work, with our co-workers, with the saints, and in the church, which are like thorns that prick and wound us. Throughout our life&rsquo;s journey our experience is one of being broken. Perhaps some would say that this is very bad, but we must remember that this is a necessary process; it is the pathway that every seeker of the Lord must follow.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BEING CONSTRICTED<br />
IF WE KNOW RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Although we have tasted the sweetness of the Lord&rsquo;s love and experienced His riches, these experiences are rather shallow and are in the initial stage, in the first two chapters of Song of Songs. If we remain in this stage, one day the Lord will cause us to realize that we are constricted by a wall and cannot move and that He is the mountain-leaping and hill-skipping Christ. We are motionless and lifeless, but He is in resurrection. He will not deceive us. He shows us that there are mountains and hills on His pathway for us, but they are not a problem to those who are in resurrection, because it is easy to leap and skip over the mountains and hills. If we remain in our feelings, we will become a weak maiden who is constricted in a spiritless and lifeless room. Hence, He comes to call us out of our self, to come away and walk with Him. This is to enter into His resurrection. According to our feeling, everything is death, but according to His feeling, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone, the flowers are blooming, and the birds are singing. It is not the time to lie down inside the house but to go out and move.</p>
<p>This was Paul&rsquo;s experience while he was in prison. Even though his body was constricted in the prison, he was leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills. The prison did not constrict Paul. The books of Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and 2 Timothy reveal that he was leaping and skipping. He was not oppressed or downcast, saying, &ldquo;Formerly, I could go to Corinth and Asia, but now I cannot move freely. In the past I was received and welcomed everywhere I went, but now all have turned away from me.&rdquo; If Paul had such an attitude, he would have indeed been in prison and would have been buried there. However, Paul was not imprisoned; he was in resurrection. His spirit was not bound to a prison. Hence, in Philippians he could say, &ldquo;In like manner you also rejoice, and you rejoice together with me&rdquo; (2:18). He was able to write Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and 2 Timothy because he was not in a &ldquo;prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the prison Paul had a deeper pursuing of the Lord. Paul said that he desired &ldquo;to know [Christ] and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death&rdquo; (Phil. 3:10). This means that Paul allowed his human element to be put to death so that God&rsquo;s element could be brought forth through death. The Epistles that he wrote while in prison indicate that the element of Paul was put to death and that Christ was expressed through him. Hence, in Philippians 1:20-21 Paul said, &ldquo;Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death. For to me, to live is Christ.&rdquo; Paul could say this because he had a vision, a revelation, of resurrection, not because he enjoyed Christ&rsquo;s sweetness like a bundle of myrrh, a cluster of henna flowers, or an apple tree. These verses are not a matter of enjoyment but of seeing a vision. Paul saw and knew Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and in this resurrection he was able to endure the sufferings that others could not endure. Prison did not constrict him; it only put to death his natural element and brought forth the element of Christ within him. Hence, the longer Paul was imprisoned, the more he was conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death, bearing Christ&rsquo;s death in his body.</p>
<p>This principle applies to our personal experience and also to the church. The churches in all the localities cannot circumvent this principle. After a period of time there will be a revival, and then after another period of time there will be a trial. The Lord uses this cycle to bring us deeper and higher so that we may know and experience Him more. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, one day we will arrive at a stage when others will say that we are going down, but we will say, &ldquo;No, we are rising up,&rdquo; or others will say that it is winter, but we will say, &ldquo;No, the winter is past, the flowers are blooming, and the birds are singing.&rdquo; This indicates that we know resurrection. This is not merely to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness but even more to know His resurrection. When we know His resurrection, we will be fresh, living, strong, and powerful, and we will experience the power of resurrection practically.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BROKEN IN ORDER TO<br />
EXPERIENCE THE LORD&rsquo;S DEATH<br />
AND KNOW HIS RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>We must experience the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection one day at a time and one experience at a time. Our spiritual experiences have not been arranged in order for us to remain whole. They are for us to be broken and for our human element to be put to death so that we would have a deeper knowing of Christ&rsquo;s death and His resurrection. This is to be delivered from our human element and to let God&rsquo;s element grow within us. Hence, there is no room for wishful thinking in our spiritual journey. Many things are contrary to our desire, cause us grief, and make us disheartened. This is our path, this is where we grow, and this is also where the New Jerusalem is produced. The New Jerusalem is constructed with precious stones. Precious stones are produced through intense heat and high pressure. We need heat and pressure so that we can be transformed. If we realize this, we will be at peace and will rejoice in the midst of a painful experience instead of losing heart. Just as the apostle Paul, we will be able to say, &ldquo;That I may know Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo;</p></body></html>
