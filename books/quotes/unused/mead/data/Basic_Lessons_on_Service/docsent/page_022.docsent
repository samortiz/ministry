   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Learning to Apply the Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>at the Appropriate Time</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We also need to learn how to apply the hymns at the appropriate time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Certain hymns are good for certain times in the meeting, so we have to know the hymns first and then apply them at the proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Certain hymns are very good to start a section of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After a section of the meeting has been started, we may need another hymn to strengthen and enrich the started section.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To strengthen and enrich what has been started is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Teamwork is involved here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One person starts, and all the others have to continue to strengthen and to enrich what has been started.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also a hymn may be needed to prolong and uplift the same section.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here there is the need of skill.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Something has been started and strengthened and enriched, but within a short time it may disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we have to prolong it and uplift it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, to apply the hymns at the appropriate time, we need to follow the atmosphere of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the atmosphere of the meeting is solemn, a hymn of joy, a rejoicing hymn, does not fit the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, calling a proper hymn at a proper time depends upon how much we can sense the atmosphere of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>D. Distributing the Bread and the Cup 1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Neither Too Early nor Too Late</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The proper distributing of the bread and the cup also requires our learning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should distribute the bread and the cup neither too early nor too late.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is somewhat like serving a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One does not serve the main course at the very beginning of the meal nor after the dessert has been finished.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is either too early or too late.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the Remembrance of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Reaches the High Tide</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to distribute the bread and the cup when the remembrance of the Lord reaches the high tide.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that the atmosphere of our remembering the Lord has reached the highest point.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Better with Some Thanks Given to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, it is better to distribute the bread and the cup with some thanks given to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We receive the bread and the wine mostly in a silent way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is better to receive the bread that comes from the Lord and give Him some thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Luke 22:19a says that the Lord took the bread and gave thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The focus of this message is expressed in the following statement: the proper remembrance of the Lord depends upon our proper practice.</S>
