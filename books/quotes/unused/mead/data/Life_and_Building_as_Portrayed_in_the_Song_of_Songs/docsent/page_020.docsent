   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HIDING IN THE ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must also stay in the secret of the steep places, where we experience the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is mentioned in Psalm 91:1, "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all must learn to hide ourselves in the secret place of the Most High.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means to be in the presence of God in the heavenly places, which is to stay in the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I am troubled by a certain person or a particular situation, I must pray, "O Lord Jesus, keep me in the cleft of the rock, and help me to stay in the secret of the steep places.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>O Lord, may I stay at Your cross, and may I stay in Your presence in the heavenlies."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this way I am crossed out, and everything is under my feet.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a wonderful working out of the transformation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one will fail to be transformed by such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as we are staying at the cross and in the heavenly places in the Lord's presence, there will be a real growth in life and transformation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>PERMEATED WITH DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After a long period of such experiences, we come to 3:6, "Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is better to say "permeated with myrrh and frankincense."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know that in typology myrrh signifies the fragrance of Jesus' death, and frankincense signifies the sweet flavor of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all must be permeated by the flavor of the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we will be perfumed with myrrh and frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not just a doctrine to learn; it is an experience that takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For many months and years we need to be under the permeating fragrance of the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition to the myrrh and frankincense, there are also the "powders of the merchant."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the merchant, and all of His sweet powders must saturate us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be permeated with the death and resurrection of Christ and with all the attributes of the heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will surely bring about a real transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>PILLARS SUPPORTING GOD'S INTEREST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The seeking one has now become pillars of smoke standing on the earth supporting the expanse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Apostles Paul and John were such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were, and still are today, the pillars of smoke in the whole universe supporting the skies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we read their writings, we realize that they are real pillars to the skies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we become such pillars, the Lord can commit His purpose to us and upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we are pillars that stand fast without shaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This figure is taken from the ancient mode of construction in which they did not use walls to support the building, but they used pillars or columns.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything rested upon these pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why Paul mentioned Peter, James, and John as pillars of the church Gal 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 1 Timothy 3:15, the church of the living God is spoken of as the pillar and ground of the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now the seeking one has become such a pillar to uphold God's interests on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE REST OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Who is this one?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"Behold his couch, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel" 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The answer came that she is now the couch of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The question was about her, but the answer is concerning Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because she is now one with Solomon; she is one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the content and she is the container.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A couch is a kind of container to hold the content, not for moving, but for resting in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The valiant men of war are around this couch.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This surely means that she has now come into the stage of spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only the mature ones can fight in the war, and here the war is waged even at night.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet even during the war in the night, Christ can still have His rest in such a seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Who is this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She is the rest of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She is not only the pillar supporting God's interests on the earth, but she is also the couch affording the rest to Christ, even during the war at night.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now she is not for her own satisfaction, but for Christ's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In chapter two, she was under the apple tree for her satisfaction, but now Solomon lies down and has his satisfaction in her.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who is this one?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is Solomon's couch, his resting place during the war at night.</S>
