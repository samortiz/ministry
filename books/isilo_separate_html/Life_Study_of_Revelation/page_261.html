In this message we shall consider the various items found in this conclusion.</p><p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;And he said to me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must swiftly take place.&rdquo; The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, who sent His angel to show the things in this book, is the Lord Jesus (1:1; 22:16). Verse 16 says, &ldquo;I Jesus have sent Mine angel to testify to you these things for the churches.&rdquo; The testimony of this book was given by the Lord Jesus for the churches. Hence, to comprehend and keep it, we need to be in the churches and for the churches.</p><p>In this book the Lord God is called the God of the spirits of the prophets. This indicates that all the prophecies in this book are inspired by the very God who inspired the spirits of the prophets in both the Old and New Testaments. It also indicates that these prophecies are related to those in the Old and New Testaments, all of which were spoken by the prophets in their spirit under the inspiration of God. Hence, to comprehend these prophecies, we also need to be in our spirit under God&rsquo;s anointing.</p><h2 class="head1">I. WARNING THAT THE LORD IS COMING SOON</h2><p>In verses 7, 12, and 20 we have the warning that the Lord is coming soon. In each of these verses the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I come quickly.&rdquo; This is the Lord&rsquo;s warning. If we take heed to this warning, we shall be blessed; otherwise, we shall forfeit the blessing. Do not think that because the Lord has been tolerating the situation for more than nineteen centuries, He is slow to come back. Look at the world situation today. We do not know what will happen within the next few days. In this age, things happen very quickly. Therefore, we must pray and be watchful. We must also be prepared in spirit and in our daily life. May the Lord cover us that we may be a watchful, praying, and prepared people.</p><h2 class="head1">II. BLESSING OF KEEPING THE WORDS<br />OF THE PROPHECY OF THIS BOOK</h2><p>In verse 7 the Lord also says, &ldquo;Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.&rdquo; Here the Lord tells us clearly that if we keep the words of this prophecy, we shall be blessed. The Lord spoke a very similar word in 1:3. There He said, &ldquo;Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and keep what is written in it.&rdquo; This book was written mainly for the blessing of God upon His people. Whether or not we shall share in this blessing depends upon how we deal with the words in this book. We must take these words and keep them. Those who do so will be blessed.</p><h2 class="head1">III. WARNING NOT TO SEAL<br />THE PROPHECY OF THIS BOOK</h2><p>Verse 10 says, &ldquo;And he said to me, Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.&rdquo; Daniel&rsquo;s prophecies were sealed, because they were given long before the time of the end, whereas the prophecies of this book should not be sealed because the time is near. Instead of being sealed, the book of Revelation should be constantly open to us and to others. For centuries, however, this book was closed and, along with the rest of the Bible, kept away from the people by the Roman Catholic Church. Through Martin Luther the Bible was made available to the people, but not much of it was opened to them. Having read through all the messages of this life-study, we can no longer say that the book of Revelation is closed to us. This book has truly been opened to the saints. Therefore, do not let this book be sealed to you or to others. Rather, you must keep the book open by plunging into every aspect of this prophecy and by diving into the flow. The more we live in the word of this book, the more open it will be to us. If we do this, the book of Revelation will be kept open to us, our family, and all the people around us.</p><p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;He who does unrighteousness, let him still do unrighteousness; and he who is filthy, let him still be made filthy; and he who is righteous, let him still do righteousness; and he who is holy, let him still be made holy.&rdquo; Whether anyone is unrighteous or righteous, filthy or holy, is a serious matter in the age of this book. To be righteous is to walk according to the righteous ways of God outwardly, whereas to be holy is to live according to the holy nature of God inwardly. In the age of this book, we must walk and live in this way that we may receive the reward; otherwise, we shall be condemned as unrighteous and filthy and receive punishment at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (v. 12).</p><p>Anyone who hardens himself and who does not keep this book open to himself or himself open to this book will remain in his pitiful condition. If he is unrighteous and filthy, he will remain unrighteous and filthy. However, if you are righteous and holy and keep yourself open to this book and this book open to you, you will continue to be righteous and holy. This means that if you keep this word open to you, you will continually become more holy and righteous. But if you do not keep it open, you will become more unrighteous and more filthy, remaining in that pitiful situation until the time of judgment comes.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_260.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_262.html">Next</a> </body></html>
