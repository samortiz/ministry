   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE PRACTICE 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our burden in this book is to fellowship concerning the practice of the Lord's advanced recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Beginning in 1984 I began to have a new study that lasted about four and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The subject of my study was the New Testament way of Christian service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We needed to see how to serve God, how to meet together, how to function, how to carry out the work, and how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We needed to investigate how to carry out these things according to God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, throughout the history of the church, some of the seeking saints saw certain things concerning how to serve, how to meet, how to function, and how to preach the gospel to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They saw the truth concerning such things as baptism by immersion and the administration of the presbytery, the eldership, in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A big advance concerning the practice of the church life was with Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren in the eighteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then in the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the British Brethren to recover more.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the twentieth century, the Lord brought us in mainland China into His recovery through Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He took the lead to read about the history of the church and to read the main writings of the seeking ones throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We put many of the things we saw into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, we found out that some of the things in our practice were not so fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1931 the Brethren sent some saints to visit us in Shanghai, and their visit caused a lot of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee went abroad to visit them in 1933, and he saw the real situation among them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through that visit, he saw the shortages in the practice of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then he saw the boundary of the local church and the local ground of the church to keep the unique oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Brethren did not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Later he saw the revelation of the meeting of the church as unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to this revelation, when the whole church comes together, each saint should have something to share, so "each one has" v. 26 . Brother Nee called this kind of meeting a meeting of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This meeting is not according to the traditional way of meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such a traditional way of meeting has become the major meeting and the major structure of the practice of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening were taken away from Christianity, the entire structure of Christianity would collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Nee saw that this meeting was not scriptural, and he said that it was according to the customs of the nations 2 Kings 17:8 NASB .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THREE PROBLEMS IN OUR PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1984 I fully realized that we needed to be adjusted and have some advancement in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I saw three major problems in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first problem was concerning our practice in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the New Testament, the preaching of the gospel should be practiced by the believers going out to visit people, not by inviting people to come to their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Peter spoke to a big congregation on the day of Pentecost, but this happened under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That big congregation was prepared by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The major way to preach the gospel is by going to visit people to bring them the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Related to the preaching of the gospel, the word go is a strong word in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus charged us to go to disciple the nations Matt 28:19 , and He Himself set up a pattern of going to people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead of inviting people to come to Him, He went to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, He came down from the heavens to the earth to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While He was on this earth, He went out again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He went to village after village Luke 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He sent out the twelve and the seventy to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord charged the seventy to find God's chosen sons of peace among the wolves Luke 10:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The practice of preaching the gospel in the New Testament is a practice of visiting people, but our practice was different from this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we began to practice visiting people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, the results confirmed the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second major problem in our practice was concerning the way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother Nee saw the truth concerning the meeting of mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 in 1937, and his messages were eventually printed in the book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1948 he released the messages that are now in the book entitled Church Affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In that book he pointed out that the Lord's Day message meeting with one man speaking and the rest listening is not scriptural and is according to the customs of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 1984 I was reminded of Brother Nee's fellowship, and I realized that our way of meeting was not up to the standard of the biblical revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The third major problem that I saw related to our practice was the matter of how the saints should function.</S>
