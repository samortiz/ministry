<h2 class="head1">GOD'S REVELATION BEING PROGRESSIVE</h2><p>In reading the Bible, we find that God's revelation is always progressive and advancing. If we only pay attention to ultimate absolutes when reading the Bible and fail to see that revelation is progressive, we will not be able to keep up with God's way. God's revelation is progressive. The offerings in Genesis were less profound than the offerings in Exodus, while the offerings in Leviticus were deeper than those in Exodus. This is one example of progression. All the revelation in the Bible is progressive. If we put all the advancing stages together, we have a complete picture. The absolutes in the Bible are the sum totals of the individual advancements.&mdash;Excerpt</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS</h2><h2 class="head2">The Boundaries Measured Out by the Lord (Kansu Province)</h2><p>Our hearts are really full of joy to see that in these days God has gained people everywhere to speak for Him. Such speaking is like the flowing of a river. We only hope that He will be able to get through in Lingxia. We hope He would not just be in us through His indwelling, but that He would come in and go out among us, freely flowing out through us. Amen!</p><p>The message "Seizing the Opportunity" brought forth a deep responding "Amen" from our hearts! As we look back, we are filled with a sense of repentance! God was not short in granting us the grace, but we were ignorant of the times He was caring for us! We do not know what to say. We were too reserved in the past because we wanted to protect ourselves. As a result, we damaged the future of the church of God! Now we can only weep and repent.</p><p>God has recently shown us that the only way to attain wealth is to borrow empty vessels from the neighbors. He says, "Borrow...and not just a few" (2 Kings 4:3). Whenever we say there are no empty vessels, the oil stops! Therefore, please send us a few extra copies of all your publications, perhaps twenty, but at least fifteen, because the number of people in our meetings has increased from ten to twenty-three. Furthermore, most of us came from denominations, and we especially need nurturing and training in the truth. There are also one or two brothers and sisters in other places who need to receive these supplies.</p><p>Please remember us in your prayers and in your move of gospel migrations. We would like to remind you that we are a gateway to the gospel work among Tibetans and Moslems. The Lord measured this area to you long ago, so you would not be overstepping your bounds to come here.</p><p>Please include us in your prayers that God would have much mercy on us!</p><p>A little member in the Lord,<br />Wang Guo-jing<br />October 3, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: Jing-Yun Book Store, Lingxia, Kansu province</p>
