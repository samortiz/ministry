   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FOUR HUNDRED EXPERIENCING AND ENJOYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE EPISTLES 106 3.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a Letter of His</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Corinthians 3:3 says, Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse reveals that we may express Christ as His letter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here a letter of Christ does not mean a letter written by Christ; rather, this letter is a composition that uses Christ as the alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the content to convey and express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All believers of Christ should be such living letters of Christ so that others may read and know Christ in their being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A letter of Christ is composed using Christ as the words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From beginning to end, Christ is every part of such a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, a letter of Christ speaks Christ, for every part of the letter expresses Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to make us the living letters of Christ, He needs to be written, wrought, into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>People should be able to read Christ on our being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may preach about Christ, but how much of Christ can people read on us?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When people observe the way that we live, they should read Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need more of Christ written upon us; that is, we need more of Christ wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ should be wrought into our thinking, our loving, our choosing, and into our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The extent to which Christ can be seen or read by others in us depends upon the extent to which Christ has been written into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a matter not of doctrine but of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When a man is regenerated by the Holy Spirit and his spirit is made alive, he becomes a living epistle of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This living epistle is written with the Spirit of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that God writes Christ into the believers by the Spirit, imprinting Christ into them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By having Christ inscribed into us, we also become living letters of Christ, which can be read by others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many cases of young people who have been read by their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At first, their parents opposed them because they had turned to the Lord or had come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But even while the parents were opposing them, they were reading what had been inscribed of Christ into them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, after a period of time many of these opposing parents turned to the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if your parents are opposing you, they are still watching you, reading you as a letter of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, if you live and walk in the Spirit of life in your relationship with your parents, they will be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although you may not intentionally try to honor your parents, spontaneously you render them the most excellent and wonderful respect because you walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your parents will notice this, appreciate it, and eventually may be convinced and subdued by it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>a. Ministered by the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 3 Paul says that the Corinthian believers were a letter of Christ ministered by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that through their ministry the apostles wrote such a letter of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this verse the word ministered actually means served.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, Paul is saying that the Corinthian believers are a letter of Christ served by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, realizing that the word serve is not adequate, Paul went on to use the word inscribed .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This explains the meaning of ministered, or served.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul s way of ministering was by inscribing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul and his co-workers were writing living epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These epistles were their letters of commendation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The apostles were the writers, and the believers were the epistles written by them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As one who was a pattern for living Christ for the church, Paul was competent in Christ to write these living letters with Christ Himself as the spiritual alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was qualified, and he had a mastery of the skill necessary for this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The book of Revelation says clearly that Christ is the Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, and the Omega, the last letter 22:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Surely Christ is also all the letters between alpha and omega.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anyone who lives Christ for the church knows Christ as alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and every other letter of the heavenly alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all should look to the Lord for His mercy and grace in order to carry on the work of writing Christ into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead of merely teaching doctrines or the Bible to others, we must do the unique work of writing living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The letters of Christ are written by the ministry of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The apostles are filled with Christ so that their ministry spontaneously ministers Christ to those whom they contact, inscribing Christ in their heart and making them living letters conveying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As apostles, Paul and his co-workers were themselves letters of Christ, epistles written with Christ as the content 2 Cor 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul was a living letter written of Christ by the Holy Spirit with all the realities of Christ as the writing element.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today when we read 2 Corinthians, which is Paul s autobiography, we can see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can read Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What is written in Paul s Epistles is nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is conveyed to the readers in every book that he wrote.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul is always associated with Christ because Paul is Christ s letter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we read him, we see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is difficult not to refer to Paul when we speak about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The fourteen Epistles of Paul constitute half of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Without these fourteen Epistles, the New Testament would not be complete Col 1:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the Corinthians were sinners, not knowing Christ, Paul came to them and brought them to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He begot them in Christ through the gospel and became their spiritual father 1 Cor 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In a sense, Paul begot us also.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Paul s fourteen Epistles we see Christ to a much greater extent than what is portrayed in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We see the all-inclusive, mysterious Christ, who is the mystery of God Col 2:2 and who produces the mystery of Christ, the church Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The most striking point of Paul s Epistles is that in them he opens up the eternal and universal mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God has a mystery, which He planned in eternity past, but the four Gospels do not speak much concerning God s eternal plan as the mystery of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Paul, however, unveils to us the mystery of the all-inclusive Christ as the Head for the producing of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul was constituted with Christ and was a living letter of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul s Epistles do not convey mainly himself but the Christ with whom he was constituted to such an extent that he could say, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Paul lived and did many things, yet it was no longer he but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we read Paul s Epistles, we are reading him, yet what we see is not Paul himself but Christ as his constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Like Paul, we should be constituted with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In a sense, the name of Christ should be a part of our name, because when people read us, they see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is no longer we but Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Just as Paul says, for to us, to live is not we ourselves but Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ is our person and the reality of our person; in this sense, we are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Paul was one who wrote living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now we also must follow him to inscribe Christ into others and thereby to compose living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Wherever we go, we should write Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>What people need is to have Christ inscribed into them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We all should go forth to write living letters with the life-giving Spirit of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Some of the saints may think that because they are not apostles, they cannot participate in writing a living letter of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should not hold this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Through our preaching of the gospel, we can write Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To preach the gospel is to write a living letter.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The proper preaching of the gospel depends on our measure of life and on our experience of God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A brother with considerable experience of God and Christ may speak to a fellow worker concerning God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Instead of trying to convince him of the existence of God, the brother may testify of how he came to believe in God and receive Christ as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He may testify that something living and real came into him and changed him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Such a testimony infuses others with Christ, convinces them, and subdues them.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is the experiential way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This way is a matter of infusing into others what we have enjoyed of God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Even though unbelievers may not mentally accept what we tell them, through our experiential preaching of the gospel the element of God and of Christ will be infused into them.</S>
