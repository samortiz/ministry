   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Not Putting New Wine into Old Wineskins</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 17 says, Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word translated new in this verse is neos, which means new in time, recent, young.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The new wine here signifies Christ as the new life, full of vigor, stirring people to excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The new wine is Christ s cheering life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The divine life is likened to wine that has cheering strength.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we receive His life, it works within us all day long to stir us up and to excite us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This new wine strengthens us, energizes us, and makes us very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The kingly Savior is not only the Bridegroom to the kingdom people for their enjoyment, but also their new garment to equip and qualify them outwardly for attending the wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, He is also their new life to excite them inwardly for the enjoyment of Him as their Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He, as their heavenly King, is the Bridegroom for the kingdom people s enjoyment, and His heavenly kingdom is the wedding feast 22:2 that they may enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To enjoy Him as the Bridegroom in the kingdom feast, they need Him as their new garment outwardly and their new wine inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Consider again the example of the prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After putting on the best robe the prodigal son could still say, O father, the best robe satisfies you, but it doesn t satisfy me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am still hungry and need to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Immediately the father told the servant to kill the fatted calf and said, Let us eat, and be merry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the father s provision is not just for something outward, but also for something within.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, after the Lord spoke about the new garment, He directly proceeded to speak of the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The new wine is not a provision for the outward need, but for the inward need.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need something to cover us, and we also need something to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are so poor outwardly, and we are so empty inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need the robe upon us for the Father s sake, and we need the new wine within us for our own sakes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need both the new garment and the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord is the new garment to us, and He is also the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is our covering and also our content.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He not only qualifies us, but He satisfies us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, He is our qualification and our satisfaction, the provision for our outward need and the provision for all our inward hunger and thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 17 the Lord said that we should not put new wine into old wineskins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Old wineskins signify religious practices, such as the fasting held by the Pharisees in the old religion and the disciples of John in the new religion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All religions are old wineskins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>New wine put into old wineskins bursts the wineskins by its fermenting power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To put new wine into old wineskins is to put Christ as the exciting life into any kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what the so-called fundamentalists and Pentecostals are practicing today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They attempt to squeeze Christ into their different modes of religious ritual and formality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The kingdom people should never do this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They must put the new wine into fresh wineskins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The new wine needs a wineskin, a container.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the new wine is filled with fermenting power, if you put it into an old wineskin, the fermenting power of the new wine will burst the old wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Any religious practice is an old wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this verse Christ seemed to be saying to the Pharisees and the disciples of John, Fasting is an old wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not try to put the new wine of My life into the wineskin of your old religious practices.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The wine will burst your religious practices.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The new wine of My life requires a new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some indeed have received the new wine, but they have attempted to take the new wine back and pour it into an old wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have been observing this kind of folly for more than forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people have come to the local church and tasted the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They have said, This is really wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is just what my church needs.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then they tried to bring this new wine back to that old wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do you know what happened?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The old wineskins burst, and the new wine was spilled.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, if you put the new wine into a new wineskin, both will be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have seen that the new wine belongs in the new wineskins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But today the so-called charismatic movement has been brought into the old Catholic wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even some Catholic churches have charismatic masses.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The charismatic things are being mixed with the mass and with the worship of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What confusion!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the leaven mixed with the fine flour 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, it is the new wine put into the old wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am concerned that this wine is no longer the new wine, for it seems to have no fermenting power.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If it did, the old wineskin would burst.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the charismatic movement were the genuine new wine filled with the fermenting power, it would burst that old Catholic wineskin.</S>
