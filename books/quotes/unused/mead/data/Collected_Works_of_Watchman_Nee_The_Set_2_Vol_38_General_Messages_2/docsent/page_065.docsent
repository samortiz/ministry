   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Why is Satan doing everything he can to frustrate our prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Answer: Satan will do anything that he can to cut off our fellowship with heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Consequently, he will pay any price to frustrate genuine prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He constantly attacks the prayers of the believers and the prayers of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He knows that once he prevails in his attack on prayers, he can rest in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we must be watchful and on guard against Satan, particularly when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to pay attention to several things when we deal with Satan's attacks:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 Satan will attack our faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He knows that as long as he can make us feel unworthy, weak, and lacking in faith towards the Lord, we will lose our heart to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2 Sometimes he attacks our body, mind, mentality, and other physical faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we feel tired and enervated, we have no interest in praying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must guard ourselves from these things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These things are surmountable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord will take responsibility for the things that are beyond our power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3 Sometimes Satan will attack the time we have set aside for prayer, whether it is our individual prayer time or the prayer time of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people have similar experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Satan is very subtle in his deception.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He either usurps the time of prayer, or he causes us to not pray genuine prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes we have the time to pray, but lack the life to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4 Sometimes Satan will frustrate us from having uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He will produce a barrier between us and the Lord so that we cannot contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is as if a cloud strangely appears between us and Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>5 Finally, Satan is determined to shut us up in darkness so that we do not see the need for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He turns our focus continually to other things so that we suffer in our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must never fall into Satan's trap.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to look to the Lord, gather material for prayer, and pay more attention to the Lord's interest and needs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have a great responsibility to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consequently, we have to watch and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Question: According to the Lord's Word, what kind of prayer should we pay attention to other than our personal prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Answer: We should pay attention to corporate prayers, that is, the prayer of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we talk about the prayer of the church, we do not mean that personal prayers are unimportant; we are not insensitive to the need of personal prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But there is a law in God's kingdom: Some things are impossible for an individual to do alone; they require a collective effort and mutual support.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Mutuality is particularly necessary in the matter of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who follow the Lord constantly realize the need for praying with other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes it is not enough for a person to pray alone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Particularly for matters as great as God's kingdom, the only prayer that works is one in which the whole church strives to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord said, "My house shall be called a house of prayer" Matt 21:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can follow this with the phrase "whose house we are" Heb 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord said, "Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst" Matt 18:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Both fact and experience tell us that when we are gathered together in the Lord, there is more of the Lord's presence than when we are by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord is in the midst of the church; He cannot be in the midst of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With individuals, there can be no "midst."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord can only be inside an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The portion of the Lord which is assigned to "in their midst" cannot be found in individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we truly are gathered together into the Lord, we will feel the broadening sphere of our prayer, and we will be much more empowered in our prayer-battle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, in our prayer meeting we can often experience the Holy Spirit revealing God's will to us, burdening us, and giving us utterance for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can, of course, say much more on the prayer of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But I will stop here and say only one important word: The prayer of the church cannot replace our personal prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the same time, personal prayers will always come short of the prayer of the church; they are not on the same level as the prayer of the church.</S>
