   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Genesis 1:1-2 says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These two verses are made more clear by translating them directly from the Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the original language, verse one says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The heavens here are plural in number and refer to the heavens of all the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The earth has its heaven, and so do all the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The direct translation of verse two is: "And the earth became not "was" waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Hebrew, preceding "the earth" there is the conjunction "and."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"; there were no difficulties, no problems, but then something happened: "and the earth became waste and void."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word "was" in Genesis 1:2 "And the earth was waste and void" and the word "became" in Genesis 19:26, where Lot's wife became a pillar of salt, are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lot's wife was not born a pillar of salt; she became a pillar of salt.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The earth was not waste and void at the creation, but later became waste and void.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God created the heavens and the earth, but "the earth became waste and void."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This reveals that the problem is not with the heavens but with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We see then that the earth is the center of all problems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God contends for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus taught us to pray, "Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth" Matt 6:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the meaning of the original language, the phrase "as in heaven, so also on earth" is common to all three clauses, not only to the last clause.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, the original meaning is: "Your name be sanctified, as in heaven, so also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your kingdom come, as in heaven, so also on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This prayer reveals that there is no problem with "heaven"; the problem is with the "earth."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the fall of man, God spoke to the serpent, "Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life" Gen 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This meant that the earth would be the serpent's sphere, the place upon which he would creep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The realm of Satan's work is not heaven, but earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the kingdom of God is to come, then Satan must be cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If God's will is to be done, it must be done on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If God's name is to be sanctified, it must be sanctified on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the problems are on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Two words in Genesis are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One is "subdue" in Genesis 1:28, which can also be translated "conquer."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The other is "keep" in Genesis 2:15, which can also be translated "guard."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We see from these verses that God ordained man to conquer and guard the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's original intention was to give the earth to man as a place to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was not His intention that the earth would become desolate Isa 45:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God desired, through man, to not allow Satan to intrude upon the earth, but the problem was that Satan was on earth and intended to do a work of destruction upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, God wanted man to restore the earth from Satan's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another matter we need to note is that God required man, strictly speaking, not only to take back the earth, but also the heaven which is related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Scripture there is a difference between "heavens" and "heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The "heavens" are where the throne of God is found, where God can exercise His authority, while "heaven" in the Scriptures sometimes refers to the heaven which is related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is this heaven which God also wants to recover see Rev 12:7-10 .</S>
