BEING FULL OF WORDS,<br>HIS SPIRIT CONSTRAINING HIM,<br>AND HIS INWARD PARTS BEING LIKE NEW WINESKINS<br>THAT WERE ABOUT TO BURST</H2><P>Elihu said that he was full of words, that his spirit in his inward parts constrained him, and that his inward parts were like wine that was not vented and like new wineskins that were about to burst (vv. 15-19). He desired to speak that he might have some relief, without respecting any man's person nor flattering any man (vv. 20-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. DECLARING THAT HIS WORDS<br>WOULD MANIFEST THE UPRIGHTNESS OF HIS HEART</H2><P>Elihu went on to speak to Job, saying, "Now, Job, hear my speaking,/And give ear to all my words" (33:1). Elihu spoke here without any politeness or humility. If we would speak to others in such a way, they would surely be offended. Today we certainly should not tell the saints to give ear to all our words.</P><P>Elihu then declared that his words would manifest the uprightness of his heart and that his tongue would speak what he knew sincerely (v. 3). Saying that the Spirit of God had made him and that the breath of the Almighty had enlivened him, Elihu told Job, "If you can, respond to me;/Arrange your words before me; take your stand" (v. 5). Furthermore, Elihu said that no fear of him would terrify Job and that Elihu's pressure could not be heavy upon him (v. 7). This kind of talk was altogether unnecessary.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. CORRECTING JOB, TELLING HIM<br>THAT HE WAS NOT RIGHT IN SAYING<br>THAT HE WAS CLEAN AND WITHOUT TRANSGRESSION</H2><P>Elihu corrected Job, telling him that he was not right in saying, "I am clean and without transgression;/I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me" (v. 9). According to Elihu, Job was also not right in saying, "Behold, He finds occasions for hostility against me;/He considers me as His enemy./He puts my feet in stocks;/He watches all my paths" (vv. 10-11). Explaining that God is greater than man, Elihu continued by rebuking Job, asking him, "Why do you contend with Him,/Saying that He does not answer for any of His affairs?" (v. 13). It is hard to understand why Elihu talked to Job in such a way.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_079.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_081.html">Next</a> </body></html>
