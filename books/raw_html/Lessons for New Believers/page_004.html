 <h2 class="head1">RECONCILED TO GOD</h2>
<p>Once a person is justified, he is reconciled to God. In the past we were God&rsquo;s enemies because of sin, but now by the blood we are forgiven, washed, separated unto God, in harmony with God, and justified by God. Consequently, we are reconciled to God. This reconciliation includes acceptance. As soon as we are reconciled to God, God accepts our very person.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:20-22 shows that we, God&rsquo;s enemies, have been reconciled to God by the blood the Lord Jesus shed on the cross. Romans 5:9-11 says that since we have been justified because of the Lord Jesus, we are also reconciled to God because of Him, or through Him. Now we no longer have any problems before God and are accepted by Him. Since all enmity between God and us has been removed, we have been completely reconciled to God and are in harmony with Him; we are acceptable and pleasing to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REGENERATED</h2>
<p>We are now thoroughly cleansed outwardly and have no more problems with God. However, this is not enough, because our life within is still natural and of the old creation. Thus, we need another life; we need regeneration.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation has two aspects: inward and outward. The outward aspect can be compared to putting on clothes, and the inward aspect, to eating. For a person to exist, he needs to put on clothes in order to look proper and he needs to eat in order to survive. He needs to take care of both these inward and outward aspects. Likewise, God&rsquo;s salvation also takes care of both our inward and outward needs.</p>
<p>In Luke 15 there are two aspects to what the prodigal son obtained from the father when he returned home. The first thing the father did was outward; he gave his son a robe, a ring, and sandals to wear. When the son returned, he was like a beggar, exceedingly ragged and filthy in his appearance. There was no way for him to enter into the father&rsquo;s house in such a condition because the father&rsquo;s house was grand and beautiful, and his beggar-like appearance did not match the father&rsquo;s house. Thus, while he was still outside the house, the father changed his clothes and put a robe, ring, and sandals on him. He now looked proper, matching the condition of the father&rsquo;s house; consequently, he could enter the father&rsquo;s house. This, however, is merely outward redemption, not inward salvation. Therefore, after he entered the father&rsquo;s house, the father said, &ldquo;Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry&rdquo; (v. 23).</p>
<p>This parable is a type of salvation. It shows that the Lord Jesus in His redemption has become our outward robe of righteousness in order that we may be redeemed and accepted by God. It also shows that He is like a slaughtered calf, giving us His life so that we can take Him in as our life supply, satisfying us within and making us merry.</p>
<p>Hence, everything that God does in the first ten items is outside of us. He chose us, predestinated us, called us, sprinkled us with His blood, redeemed us, forgave us, washed us, sanctified us, justified us, and reconciled us to Himself, accepted us; all of these items are outward. These items are very precious, and there is no doubt that we are saved persons. We have no more problems before God, before the law, and before His righteousness. We have the basis, the proof, and the assurance that we are saved. However, God&rsquo;s salvation does not stop here. God&rsquo;s salvation must go one step further so that we can receive His life within, so that we can be regenerated.</p>
<p>Regeneration means to be born of God. This is to be begotten of God, to have God Himself enter into us as life, and to be born of Him.</p>
<p>We need to realize that if man had not fallen, he would have only needed to receive life within him; this is the story of the garden of Eden in Genesis 2. There, man did not have the problem of needing clothing; he had no need of being redeemed outwardly. It was not until the fall of man in Genesis 3 that clothing became a necessity. As soon as man fell, he felt ashamed and sewed leaves to make an apron to cover his body. Eventually, God made a coat of lamb&rsquo;s skin to clothe him. The coat of skin refers to Christ being our righteousness that we may be accepted by God outwardly. This is the outward aspect of redemption, which is due to man&rsquo;s fall. If man had not fallen, the story between man and God would only have an inward aspect related to life. However, we are all under the effects of the fall. Like prodigal sons, we have returned to God&rsquo;s presence; hence, we must first be dealt with outwardly. We must be justified and accepted by God in Christ. Only then can God come into us to enliven us, causing us to be regenerated to have God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>First Peter 1:3 says that God has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. First Peter 1:23 says that we have been regenerated through the living word of God. First John 5:1 says that we have been begotten of God. Furthermore, John 1:12-13 says that we, who have received the Lord, were all begotten of God. There are also two additional verses concerning regeneration. John 3:3 says, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God,&rdquo; and verse 5 says, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regeneration is having God enter into us as life&mdash;having the life of God in addition to our human life. This is the second life, the second birth; hence, it is called regeneration. In man&rsquo;s first birth he is born of his parents, thereby receiving Adam&rsquo;s life. In his second birth he is born of the Spirit and of God, thereby obtaining God&rsquo;s life. Regeneration is to be born of God.</p>
