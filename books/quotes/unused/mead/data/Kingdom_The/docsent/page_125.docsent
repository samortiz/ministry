   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord goes on to mention the gates of Hades Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hades is the place where the dead are kept, and the gates of Hades is a term denoting the authority of death, which is the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It also represents Satan, the embodiment of death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the Lord Jesus is the embodiment of life, so Satan is the embodiment of death, represented in Matthew 16:18 by the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is built with the rock and the stones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Wherever you find the building of the church, there will be warfare, because the power of death will rise up against it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the power of death can never prevail against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Death may prevail against individual Christians, but not against the builded church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In every battle against the church, Satan will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan can never prevail because the church can bind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is Satan able to bind?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some Christians seem to have more faith in Satan than in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They constantly talk about the power of Satan, saying that they do not know how to handle it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, in the local churches we not only bind he strong man, but we also plunder his house and seize all his vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The builded church has the authority to bind the strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not my word; this is the word of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"You are a stone lit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must stand upon this word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The gates of Hades shall never prevail against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church can bind, and whatever the church binds, the heavens will bind Matt 16:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The keys of the kingdom are for the producing of the church, and the church life is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, we can see five points regarding the church: the rock, the stones, the building, the defeat of the gates of Hades, and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are going to realize the builded church today, not a church in doctrine or in talk, the church must be built up with many living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The local churches are built with stones upon the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because the kingdom has the authority to bind and loose, it can never be defeated by the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Satan is first represented by the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition to this, Satan is incarnated in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand Peter was a stone; on the other hand he suddenly became Satan Matt 16:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is hard for us to imagine that this could be.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter became Satan because his self was the incarnation of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord rebuked Peter saying, "Get behind Me, Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan could never be successful simply by exercising the power of the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan is far more subtle than that.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He not only employs the power of Hades; he also gets into us and works himself into our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a dreadful, subtle thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Satan cannot prevail against the church by his power of death, but he can damage the church by his subtlety.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Where is Satan's subtlety?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His subtlety resides in the self of man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we read Matthew 16:23-26 very carefully, we will see the connection between four items the natural mind, the self, the soulish life, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus rebuked Peter for being Satan because Peter's mind was on the things of men, not on the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later the Lord spoke about the soul and denying the self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a few brief sentences the Lord mentioned Satan, the mind, the self, and the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These four things are actually four-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Satan is in your mind, your mind is in your self, and your self is in the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Wherever there is the soul-life, there is the self; wherever there is the self, there is the mind; wherever there is the mind, there is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although Satan cannot prevail against the church by exercising his power and authority, he can damage the church by his subtlety of being one with you in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Satan's subtlety is to unite with you in your mind, in your opinion, and in your dissenting thought.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If in any church there is a dissenting situation, that situation is of the mind, of Satan, of the self, and of the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It makes no difference about the reason for your dissenting opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As long as you are dissenting, you are under the subtlety of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All dissenting elements are found not in your spirit, but in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you exercise your mind, you will immediately have dissenting opinions.</S>
