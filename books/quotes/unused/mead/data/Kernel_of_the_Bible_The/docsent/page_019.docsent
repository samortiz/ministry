   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX EATING CHRIST AS THE SOLID FOOD ALLEGORIZING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians say that we should not allegorize the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, if we do not know how to allegorize the Bible, it will be a closed book to us, for the Bible is full of allegories.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many allegories in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Take, for example, John 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This verse says, In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even this Word is an allegory.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certainly Christ as the Word is not a word composed of black and white letters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is not the meaning of John 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 8:12 the Lord Jesus says, I am the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This also is an allegory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jesus is not a light given off by the sun or by a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Gospel of John also tells us that Jesus is the Lamb of God John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Certainly Christ is not a lamb with four feet and a tail.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What nonsense it would be to say that!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To say that Christ is the Lamb is to speak allegorically.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Gospel of John the death of the Lord Jesus is described in an allegorical way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is very difficult to describe a person s face.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not even a book of hundreds of pages could replace a photograph of a person s face.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you want someone to know what you look like, do not write many letters describing yourself send him a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, if you want an adequate understanding of the death of Christ, consider the figures used in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John uses three figures to depict the death of Christ: the Lamb, the serpent, and the grain of wheat John 1:29; 3:14; 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we may use thousands of words to describe the death of Christ, without these three figures we would not know the meaning of His death in an adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord for the allegories in the Gospel of John concerning Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ died on the cross as the Lamb to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was also crucified in the form of a serpent that He might destroy the enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent; nevertheless, He was crucified in the form of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ also died as a grain of wheat in order to release His life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These three allegories give us a full picture of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They indicate that Christ died to redeem us, to destroy the enemy, and to release His life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we did not have these three allegories, it would be very difficult to adequately understand the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, it is not right to say that we should not allegorize the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this message we shall see how to eat Christ as wheat and as barley.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Both wheat and barley are allegories of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is the real wheat and the real barley.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would know Christ as wheat and as barley, we need to consider both the plain words in the New Testament and the pictures in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The New Testament says clearly that Christ is our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But this statement is rather general.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In what specific way is Christ our life?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need a picture to show us how Christ can be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, we need the wheat and the barley to portray the meaning of Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>WHEAT, THE LIMITED JESUS IN HIS INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus indicated clearly that He was a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This verse says, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wheat signifies Christ in His incarnation and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To be incarnated means to be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although in eternity Christ was the unlimited God, unlimited both in space and in time, one day He was incarnated and became limited.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Oh, the unlimited God was limited in Jesus, a little carpenter from Nazareth!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although the Lord is the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived as a man, limited even in the matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When His brothers in the flesh encouraged Him to go into Judea, Jesus said, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready John 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord seemed to be saying, I don t have the freedom to go to Jerusalem; I am limited to stay in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord Jesus was not only limited in time, but also in space.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is difficult to believe that the unlimited God lived in the house of a carpenter for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is Jesus as our life, the One by whom we may live.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, wheat signifies the limited Jesus.</S>
