        <h2 class="head2">The Passover</h2>
<p>At the time of the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt, God charged them to keep the Passover as a feast (Exo. 12:1-14). The Passover is an even more perfect type of the redemption that He planned in eternity. The children of Israel, like the Egyptians, had fallen into the world, were sinful and in opposition to God, and should have been slain with the Egyptians. But God provided salvation for the children of Israel through the slaying of a lamb. According to those familiar with Israel&rsquo;s ancient history, when the children of Israel slew the passover lamb, they crossed two pieces of wood and tied the lamb&rsquo;s two forelegs to the two ends of the horizontal piece, and the lamb&rsquo;s two hind legs to the bottom of the vertical piece; it was just like a crucifixion. This is truly a perfect picture of the redemption that Christ accomplished on the cross (1 Cor. 5:7). God foreordained that Christ would be the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29). Just as a lamb was a substitute for the children of Israel, Christ is our Substitute. Just as the lamb&rsquo;s blood was shed to redeem the children of Israel, Christ&rsquo;s blood was shed so that we might be redeemed (1 Pet. 1:18-19). Just as eating the flesh of the lamb inwardly strengthened the children of Israel, the life of Christ inwardly strengthens us. Just as the redemption of the lamb brought the children of Israel to God, the redemption of Christ brings us to God. And just as the children of Israel were joined to the lamb by being in a house with blood-stricken doorposts and lintel and by eating the flesh of the lamb, we are joined with Christ by being in Him through His redemption and by receiving Christ into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Manna</h2>
<p>The types mentioned above emphasize Christ&rsquo;s bearing our sins so that we may be delivered from God&rsquo;s wrath and be made acceptable to God. However, in His redemption God planned that Christ would not only bear our sins according to His righteousness but also be our life, our bread of life, which would become a part of us so that we may live because of Him (John 6:57). God illustrated this point, using manna as a type (Exo. 16:31-32; John 6:31-35). Although the flesh of the passover lamb was food to the children of Israel, indicating Christ&rsquo;s being the inner strength and satisfaction of His redeemed, the Passover, as a type, does not give great stress to the matter of food. Instead, God emphasizes through the type of manna that Christ would come to be the bread of life to His redeemed so that they might be fed inwardly. Just as manna came down out of heaven, Christ came down out of heaven, and just as manna sustained the children of Israel in their journey through the wilderness, Christ sustains us in our journey through this world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Rock</h2>
<p>God ordained that Christ would be not only our bread of life but also our water of life. Hence, manna typifies Christ coming down out of heaven to be our bread of life (Exo. 16:15-18; John 6:31), and the rock typifies Christ being stricken on the cross to flow out as water of life to us (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). Moses represents the law, and his striking of the rock with his rod indicates that Christ was struck by the power of the law. Just as the rock was cleft to flow out water to quench the thirst of the children of Israel, Christ was cleft to flow out the water of life to quench our thirst so that we may be satisfied inwardly (John 7:37-38).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle and Its Furniture</h2>
<p>The most perfect type of Christ&rsquo;s mysterious and glorious redemption is the tabernacle and its furniture (Exo. 25&mdash;27; 30:1-10, 17-21), which are fine, beautiful pictures portraying the wonderful redemption that our wise God planned according to His good will. Everything within the tabernacle, great or small, portrays and typifies Christ and His eternal redemption (Heb. 9:1-14, 23-26; 10:1-14, 19-20).</p>
<p>The tabernacle was covered with coarse porpoise skins on the outside (Exo. 26:14), yet it had beautiful gold on the inside (25:10-40; 26:29). This typifies Christ as the Word becoming flesh to tabernacle among us (John 1:14). Although He was a lowly man who had no outwardly attracting form nor majesty (Isa. 53:2), the God of glory was in Him, and He was full of honor and glory. Just as God was manifested among and to the children of Israel through the tabernacle, Christ is manifested among us and to us. Just as God communed with the children of Israel through the tabernacle, we commune with Him through Christ. And just as the tabernacle was a place in which God met man and man met God, Christ is the place where God can fellowship with man and man can fellowship with God.</p>
<p>The bronze altar and the bronze laver were in the outer court of the tabernacle (Exo. 40:6-7). The bronze altar is where the offerings were offered; all the offerings of the children of Israel had to be offered to God on this altar. The altar typifies the cross (Heb. 13:10); Christ offered Himself on the cross to God (9:14). The bronze covering of the altar was beaten from the bronze censers of Korah&rsquo;s company, which had rebelled against God and had been judged by God (Num. 16:37-39); hence, bronze represents judgment. On the bronze altar the offering became a substitute for the offerer, who should have been judged by God&rsquo;s righteous judgment. Through the offering the offerer was forgiven and accepted by God. Similarly, Christ was judged by God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on the cross as a Substitute for all who would believe into Him so that they might be forgiven and accepted by God. All who entered into the tabernacle to draw near to God and serve God had to pass through the bronze altar and present an offering. Likewise, all those who would draw near to God and serve God must first pass through the cross of Christ and receive the crucified Christ as their Savior, their Substitute.</p>
<p>Those who passed through the bronze altar then had to pass through the bronze laver to be washed before they could go into the Tent of Meeting, to serve God (Exo. 40:30-31). The bronze laver was made from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and it reflected man&rsquo;s condition (38:8). The bronze laver typifies the Holy Spirit exposing the defilement of those who are drawing near to God and serving God, according to and through the judgment that Christ received on the cross, so that they might be washed (John 16:7-8; Titus 3:5). Once a person passed through the bronze altar and the laver, he could enter into the tabernacle to partake of everything in the tabernacle. This shows that after we have passed through the redemption of Christ on the cross and the washing and renewing of the Holy Spirit, we can partake of everything in Christ.</p>
<p>The tabernacle itself was divided into two parts&mdash;the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. In the Holy Place there were three pieces of furniture&mdash;the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar. These typify Christ&rsquo;s function in the believers. The table of the bread of the Presence was made of pure gold and acacia wood (Exo. 25:23-24). Pure gold typifies the glorious divinity of Christ, and acacia wood typifies His strong humanity. The table of the bread of the Presence typifies Christ who is both God and man becoming life in the believers so that they might live in God&rsquo;s presence (Col. 3:4). The golden lampstand lit the Holy Place, and it typifies Christ being the light of life in the believers so that we might have fellowship with God and serve God according to this light (John 1:4; 8:12). The priests burned incense to God on the golden incense altar. It also was made of pure gold and acacia wood, typifying how Christ, who is both God and man, would be our acceptable incense before God so that our prayers might be accepted by God (Rev. 8:3-4).</p>
<p>There was a separating veil in the tabernacle between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. It was within the veil, that is, in the Holy of Holies, that God appeared to man and spoke with man (Heb. 10:19-20). Before Christ died on the cross in the flesh, the way to enter into the Holy of Holies was not open for man. When Christ was cleft on the cross through His death, however, the veil covering the Holy of Holies was split as well (Matt. 27:50-51). Thus, the death of Christ removed the veil between us and God and opened the way for us to draw near to God.</p>
<p>The innermost part of the tabernacle was the Holy of Holies, which was the location of the Ark. The Ark is also called the Ark of the Testimony, and it was made of pure gold and acacia wood (Exo. 25:10-11, 22; 26:33-34). Inside the Ark there were the golden pot containing manna, the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tablets of the covenant (Heb. 9:4). The blood of the sin offering was sprinkled on the expiation cover above the Ark (Exo. 25:17, 21; Lev. 16:15), and God appeared to man and met with man above this blood-sprinkled cover (Exo. 25:21-22). The Ark typifies Christ, who is both God and man, as God&rsquo;s testimony, the One in whom is God&rsquo;s life, God&rsquo;s resurrection power (John 11:25), and God&rsquo;s law (Psa. 40:8). In Christ and by His redeeming blood, God supplies man with grace and meets with man. Now man can draw near to God and commune with God. Christ&rsquo;s redeeming blood enables man to be graced with the life of God (1 John 5:12), the power of resurrection (Phil. 3:10), and the law of life (Heb. 8:10). Under the blood and based on the blood, man is hidden with Christ in God (Col. 3:3). Through His redeeming blood, Christ enables man to enjoy God&rsquo;s life, the resurrection power of God&rsquo;s life, and the law of God&rsquo;s life, and man is joined with God. This is the testimony that God desires to express in and through Christ.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
