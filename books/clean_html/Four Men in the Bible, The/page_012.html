<h2 class="head1">VERSES IN THE BIBLE CONCERNING<br />
THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE SPIRIT OF MAN</h2>
<p>In speaking of man, the Bible particularly emphasizes the spirit of man (Zech. 12:1). In this chapter we will focus on the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. The Bible speaks of the spirit of man as well as the Spirit of God. In Ezekiel 36:26 God said, &ldquo;I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you,&rdquo; and in verse 27 He said, &ldquo;I will put My Spirit within you.&rdquo; These verses speak of both a new spirit and the Spirit of God. On the one hand, God has given us a new spirit; on the other hand, God has put His Spirit within us.</p>
<p>Please note the sequence of these verses. They do not speak of God first putting His Spirit in us and then giving us a new spirit. This would invert the actual sequence, which begins with <em>a new spirit,</em> referring to our spirit that is a vessel to contain God. In order for something to be received, there must be a prepared, receiving vessel. Hence, verse 26 speaks of a new spirit, which is a prepared vessel to contain God, and then verse 27 speaks of God putting His Spirit into this vessel. Our spirit is a vessel to contain God&rsquo;s Spirit, just as a thermos bottle is a vessel to contain hot water. A thermos bottle must first be prepared so that hot water can be poured into it. These verses show that there are two aspects to spiritual experience&mdash;our spirit and God&rsquo;s Spirit. Our spirit is a vessel, and God&rsquo;s Spirit is the content. Our spirit is the container for God&rsquo;s Spirit.</p>
<p>John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; In this verse <em>Spirit</em> refers to God&rsquo;s Spirit, and <em>spirit</em> refers to our spirit. The divine Spirit begets the human spirit, and the human spirit is born of the divine Spirit. The Spirit begets our spirit. This shows another side to the relationship between God&rsquo;s Spirit and our spirit. When speaking of our spirit containing God&rsquo;s Spirit, Ezekiel 36 first mentions our spirit and then God&rsquo;s Spirit, but when speaking of God&rsquo;s Spirit begetting our spirit, John 3 first mentions God&rsquo;s Spirit and then our spirit. Ezekiel 36 speaks of our spirit being prepared to contain the Spirit, whereas John 3 speaks of the Spirit begetting, or enlivening, our prepared spirit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; Here again the divine Spirit and the human spirit are mentioned. On the one hand, God is Spirit; on the other hand, those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness. This involves two spirits. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; The witnessing of the divine Spirit is in our human spirit. This witnessing involves two spirits, not just the witnessing of the Spirit or the witnessing of our spirit. Rather, we know that we are children of God because the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. In the Bible there are four places that speak of both the human spirit and the divine Spirit in the same context: Ezekiel 36:26-27 speaks of our human spirit containing the divine Spirit; John 3:6 speaks of the divine Spirit begetting our human spirit; 4:24 speaks of worshipping God who is Spirit in our human spirit; and Romans 8:16 speaks of the divine Spirit witnessing with our human spirit. These verses all refer to the two spirits.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT LEARNING DOCTRINES OUTWARDLY<br />
BUT BEING BORN OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Christianity is full of traditional concepts that are altogether religious and natural. Although it is not our intention to focus on the shortcomings of Christianity, I have received a burden from the Lord to speak concerning the revelation of the Spirit and our human spirit. We should never follow traditional concepts or religious thoughts. When the Lord said, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (John 3:6), He was speaking to an old Pharisee named Nicodemus, who came to the Lord at night. He did not come during the day to be with the Lord, like the twelve apostles. In fact, there were no old men among the twelve apostles. Neither was Nicodemus mentioned as being among the one hundred and twenty who were praying in the upper room in Jerusalem (Acts 1:13-15). What is an old man? An old man is a person who is full of preconceptions. A person who is only twenty years old can be an &ldquo;old young man&rdquo; if he is full of preconceptions. In contrast, a person who is seventy years old can be a &ldquo;young old man&rdquo; if he has no preconceptions. Whether we are old or young does not depend on our age but on the number of concepts and prejudices that we hold on to. The more prejudices and concepts that we have, the older we are; the fewer prejudices and concepts that we have, the younger we are.</p>
<p>Nicodemus was old because he came to the Lord full of religious concepts and traditional thoughts. As soon as he saw the Lord, he said, &ldquo;Rabbi&rdquo; (John 3:2). No one told him that the Lord Jesus was a rabbi; this came from his traditional concepts and from the poison of his religious thoughts. John the Baptist did not say, &ldquo;Behold, the Rabbi,&rdquo; when he saw the Lord coming to him; he said, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God&rdquo; (1:29). Furthermore, when John baptized the Lord, he beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven upon the Lord (v. 32). The testimony of John the Baptist was a testimony related to the Lord as the Lamb of God upon whom God&rsquo;s Spirit descended.</p>
<p>If Nicodemus had not had any preconceptions about the Lord, he would have come to the Lord and addressed Him as the Lamb of God. It would have been wonderful if he had spoken in this way, but instead, he addressed the Lord as Rabbi. Once he said, &ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; he exposed that he was fully under the influence of traditional concepts. If he had not had any traditional concepts, he would have heard the testimony of John the Baptist, and he would have spoken of the Lord as the Lamb of God with the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Nicodemus&rsquo;s concept that the Lord Jesus came from God to be a great teacher is still present in Christianity. According to this traditional concept, our greatest need is for teaching. Christianity specializes in seminaries in order to cultivate teachers. When Nicodemus, as an old religious man, addressed the Lord Jesus as Rabbi, the Lord did not argue with him. Instead, He answered, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you...that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (3:5-6). The Lord cares about the Spirit begetting spirit. This is not a matter for a rabbi or a teacher; neither is it related to teachings or doctrines.</p>
<p>It is not easy to know the spirit because the spirit is mysterious and abstract. The Chinese word for <em>prudent</em> contains the character for <em>spirit.</em> A person who is filled in spirit is prudent. If a person has no spirit, his words and actions will be awkward and clumsy. But if he is filled in spirit with the Spirit, he will be very prudent and keen.</p>
<p>Since the spirit is mysterious, many Christians do not see the matter of the spirit when they read the Bible. Although they repeatedly read the Bible, they find only doctrines, teachings, regulations, and creeds. It is easy to touch the trunk, branches, and fruit of an apple tree, but it is not easy to touch the life within the tree. The Bible is like a great apple tree&mdash;it is easy to touch its trunk, branches, and fruit, which are all outward, but it is not easy to touch the life within it. However, it is this life that is most precious. Similarly, we can touch the cover of a microphone, but it is not easy to touch the electricity that flows through the microphone. Even with a nice cover, a microphone is useless without electricity. The function of a microphone depends upon its ability to receive electricity. The Bible is like an apple tree with a trunk, branches, and fruit, yet the core of the Bible is a matter of the spirit. The Bible is a book on the spirit. Hence, we should not be like Nicodemus and follow his example in order to learn doctrines, considering the Lord Jesus merely to be a rabbi, a teacher. First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Today the Lord Jesus is a life-giving Spirit.</p>
