   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Praying and singing come out of our being filled with the Spirit and saturated with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must be men of the Spirit and of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then spontaneously we will be praying and singing persons.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We take care of the Spirit, but not that much.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only the four factors of the mingled spirit, the word, praying, and singing can constitute us into such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to fan into flame the gift of God which is in us 2 Tim 1:6 .</S>
