   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WAY ON THE STORMY SEA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After feeding the multitude, the Lord Jesus went to a high mountain to pray, and He sent His disciples to the sea 14:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a picture showing us that the Lord Jesus has ascended into the heavens and that He has put all of us on the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The life of the kingdom people today is a life in the wilderness, and the way of the kingdom people is a way on the stormy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our way on the sea is beset by tossing waves and contrary winds.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we follow the Lord Jesus, many times we will not have a comfortable feeling, and we will experience the contrary winds.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although our life is in the wilderness and our way is on the sea, we should not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the wilderness the Lord provides food to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our way, being on the stormy sea, is quite risky.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must remember, however, that the Lord is on the mountaintop in the heavens praying for us Matt 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also, He comes to us walking on the sea, with all the waves under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although we may be frightened by the tossing waves, they are under His feet Matt 14:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He walks over all the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since He treads over the waves, why should we be afraid of them?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus rebuked Peter because he had little faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the kingdom people, our life is in the wilderness and our way is on the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For both our living and our way, we need living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Among many Christians and Christian organizations, the primary concern is how to raise money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I praise the Lord that from the first day I came into the church life, there has been no need to discuss the raising of funds.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let me tell you a story which Brother Watchman Nee related to me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first local church in China was raised up in Foochow in 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The brothers met outside of Christianity and outside of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nearly all of them were students, many still in high school.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Nee was about nineteen years of age and was helping take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They began to meet in a small home and eventually had the need to rent a larger place to contain the new converts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Few among those Chinese students had much money; most were quite poor.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In one of the meetings the leading brother stood up and said, "Brothers and sisters, here is a Chinese long gown for winter use which has been offered by a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If this can be sold, the price will go toward the payment of the rent for the new meeting place."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not say who offered the long gown, but simply brought it to the meeting and announced that it was available to anyone who needed it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Two sisters were sitting there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One received the burden to buy it as soon as the announcement was made.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other side of the room she saw a brother who was quite uncomfortable due to the winter cold.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was, of course, no heat in the room.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sister saw the brother in need and had the burden to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the responsible brother announced the price of eight dollars, she spoke with the sister sitting next to her asking, "Why don't we buy this long gown for that brother?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The sister immediately responded, "I had the same feeling, but I have just four dollars."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both sisters had the same feeling and the same amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Right away they stood up, went to the front, and bought the long gown for eight dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then they asked that it be given to the brother who was uncomfortable from the cold.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Who do you think that brother was?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was the brother who had originally offered the gown!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, both the need for the hall and the need of the brother were cared for by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have seen the faithfulness of the Lord in many such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To illustrate further, when I came to this country, I had very little money.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was not sent here and supported regularly by a mission.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As some of the brothers from Taipei could testify, I came to this country without the promise of any support.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may ask, "How then was the work started?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It simply started.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The work started in this country in 1963, and we were burdened to publish the little magazine called The Stream.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although we had almost no funds, the brothers transcribed the messages, polished them, and were prepared to put them into print.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As the time came to print them, we looked at one another.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There was no need to discuss money; we all realized we did not have enough.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By the Lord's mercy I had two hundred dollars, and I contributed that toward the cost of printing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually the account contained four hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That was the beginning of the publication of The Stream.</S>
