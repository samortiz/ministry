   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>On the evening of the day that Brother Nee left, a brother who was a member of my former denomination came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He was seeking help from Brother Nee, but Brother Nee had left.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He and I had a long fellowship that evening at the seashore, since my home was not far away from the beach.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At a certain point he said, "You have to baptize me tonight in the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I said that I was not a pastor, an elder, or a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He rebuked me by saying, "You told me that all the disciples of Jesus, who are qualified to preach the gospel, are also qualified to baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You have to baptize me."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I asked him to pray with me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the word in Acts 8 came to me: "Look, water!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What prevents me from being baptized" v. 36 . Then I baptized him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we came up out of the water, we were both in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He told me that from tomorrow he would never go back to the denominations, but would come to meet with me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I told him that from tomorrow I would stop going to the Brethren meetings and would begin to meet with him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That was really the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His baptism took place on a Tuesday.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On Thursday of the same week, another two came to us, asking us to baptize them, and we did.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the Lord's Day, more were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The following Lord's Day, we had eleven brothers taking the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That was the beginning of the first local church in north China in my hometown of Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The news of this reached Brother Nee in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By the end of the year, there were about eighty of us meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the beginning of the following year, there were about one hundred meeting in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In April of that year, Sister Peace Wang came to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She was the one through whom I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By this time in 1933, she had become one of the prevailing co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then Brother Nee came, and he stayed with us for about ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Afterwards, he went to England to visit the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the first three weeks of August 1933, I was struggling with the Lord concerning giving up my job and serving Him full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord was calling me inwardly to serve Him in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time my younger brother and I had the highest paying jobs among those in the church, so many of the church's needs were secretly taken care of by us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord was calling me to give up my job, but I was considering what would happen if I did this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was helping to meet the church's needs, but if I went full-time, others would have to meet my needs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, from the first day that I was saved through Sister Wang's preaching, I was called by the Lord to serve Him full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I knew that my destiny for my entire life was to serve the Lord in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From August 1 to August 21, 1933, I was struggling with the Lord concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On Wednesday, August 21, I fellowshipped with two of the leading ones after the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I explained the situation to them and asked them to pray for me that night.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I could not go on another day without a definite decision in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Late that night I had a time with the Lord, and it was so clear that His will was for me to answer His call.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The only thing causing me to hesitate was my unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the Lord impressed me that if I did not answer His call, He would be through with me as far as His work was concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I told the Lord with tears that I would answer His call and take His way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The next day I resigned from my job.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After resigning I went to the post office the following day to pick up a letter there for me from Manchuria.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This was the first letter which I received inviting me to come to a place to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I accepted this invitation and went to the capital of Manchuria to speak for the Lord's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While I was there, a letter came to me from my general manager, saying that he did not want me to leave my job.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He said he would promote me and increase my monthly pay if I would stay.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Usually at the end of the year, the employees of this company received a good bonus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I considered that if I worked for another three months, I would receive this bonus, and then I could drop my job.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I returned home from Manchuria, there was a letter awaiting me from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was a short note from him dated August 17.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This was within the three-week period of time in which I was struggling with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This note said, "Brother Witness, concerning your future I feel that you have to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How do you feel about this?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May the Lord lead you."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That short note still means so much to me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That annulled the letter from my general manager.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I told the Lord that even if my company offered me the whole world, I would not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then I made the decision to go to Shanghai to see Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I went to Shanghai, I asked Brother Nee why he wrote that note on August 17.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He said that at that time his boat was on the Mediterranean while he was returning from Europe to China.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When he was in his cabin, he had a burden to pray for the work in China.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>While he was praying, the Lord said to him within, "You have to write a note to Witness Lee telling him that you feel he should serve the Lord full-time."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>While Brother Nee was sailing on the Mediterranean, I was struggling with the Lord in China.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We were a thousand miles apart, yet he received a burden from the Lord to write me this note at such a critical time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That fully convinced me that he was a real man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I realized that I had to work with him for the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>That was the beginning of our working together.</S>
