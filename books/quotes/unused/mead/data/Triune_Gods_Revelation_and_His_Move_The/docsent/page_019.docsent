   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REVELATION A. The Sabbath, as a Repose, Dividing God's Creation into Two Sections</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was taught from my youth that the Sabbath was given to us by God so that we may remember that He is the Creator of the heavens and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But we need to see the real spiritual significance of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Sabbath divides God's creation into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first section was without the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The life of God is not mentioned in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We see man only with the image and likeness of God but not with the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second section of the account of God's creation in Genesis 2 is centered on the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The most striking item in Genesis 2 is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A number of years ago, there was a famous teacher of the Bible who said that the tree of life is over today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the tree of life is not over, because it is mentioned in Revelation as a reward to the overcomers 2:7 and as the eternal life supply for God's redeemed in the New Jerusalem 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Sabbath divides the first section of God's creation without the life of God from the second section with the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the spiritual significance of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After God's creating work of six days, He had a repose on the seventh day, the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then on the eighth day everything is centered on the life of God, because God put the man whom He had created before the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The eighth day is the day of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our eighth day in the New Testament is from the day of the Lord's resurrection until the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all need a repose, a Sabbath, like Paul had on the road to Damascus when the Lord stopped him and brought him into the eighth day of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>B. God Particularly Making a Spirit for Man</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God particularly made a spirit for man that man may receive Him as life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Genesis 1 tells us that God created many things, but He did not give the details of His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But in chapter two He gave us a clear record with details.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God created the body for man with the dust, and God breathed into him the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Hebrew word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is the same word for spirit in Proverbs 20:27, which says that man's spirit is the lamp of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The soul is the issue of the spirit meeting with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God created man with a spirit so that man could receive Him as life and as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. The Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The tree of life signifies God as life to man so that man could be completely like God in His appearance, life, and nature but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The tree of life is a figure signifying God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Gospel of John the Lord said, "I am the life" 14:6a , and He also said that He is the vine tree 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the life and He is the tree, so He is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Revelation 2:7 says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then at the end of the Bible, the tree of life grows in the flow out of God's throne to supply the entire New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the clear revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>D. God Putting Man in Front of the Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After God created man with a spirit, God put this man into the garden in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This picture indicates that God wanted man to receive the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>E. The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as God's enemy in God's creation, implying that Satan is composed of knowledge and evil as well as good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that there is an opposer to God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is to be life to man but Satan is to be knowledge, evil, and good to man which leads to death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God prohibited Adam from partaking of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If Adam had partaken of the tree of life, he would have received life, but instead he partook of the other tree and received death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Satan tempted Eve with knowledge, causing her to doubt God's word by asking, "Has God said ?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Gen 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eve was hooked because she answered him and was brought into the realm of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such knowledge is a terrible thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times the most learned ones are the hardest ones to convince about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is easier for a simple, uneducated person to get saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the young people hear this word, they may wonder whether or not they should go to college.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 1977 I gave messages on the Life-study of Genesis in which I encouraged the young people to get the highest education.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many young people were helped by those messages which were concerning Hiram, the skillful builder of the pillars in God's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In those messages however, I pointed out that after we gain our education it must be buried so that it can be useful in resurrection for God's building see Messages Eighty-five and Eighty-six of Life-study of Genesis, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>1093-1120 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The apostle Paul received the highest education, being brought up at the feet of a learned rabbi named Gamaliel Acts 22:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After he was saved by the Lord, Paul's education and capacity came up in resurrection to be used by the Lord for the building up of His Body.</S>
