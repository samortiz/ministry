   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We must avoid the thought that man ought to have the experience of dying and resurrecting with the Lord before he can be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the Bible, once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he is born again.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"But as many as received Him...who believe into His name...were begotten...of God" John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We ought to realize that our co-resurrection with the Lord is not an experience after regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our being born again is our co-resurrection with the Lord because the Lord's death in other words, our death with Him terminated the problem of our sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then, at the resurrection of the Lord in other words, when we were resurrected with Him , He gave us a new life with which we began our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That is why the Bible says, "God...has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows that every born-again Christian has already been raised up with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the apostle Paul in Philippians 3 told us that every Christian still needs to pursue to know "the power of His resurrection" v. 10 . Many Christians are born again and have participated in the Lord's resurrection but lack the manifestation of the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we must not confuse position with experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a person believes in the Lord Jesus, although he is still very weak and ignorant, God has placed him in a position of being reckoned as having completely died, resurrected, and ascended with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who are accepted in Christ are accepted just as Christ is; this is position.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the believers may not necessarily have the experience of this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Positionally speaking, a believer in the Lord possesses all the experiences of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Experientially, at the minimum, he is born again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This rebirth is not because he has already experienced the Lord Jesus' death, resurrection, and ascension to a certain degree, but because he believes in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His position causes him to have the experience of being born again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although in experience he still does not know the power of Christ's resurrection Phil 3:10 , he has already been made alive, raised, and seated in the heavenlies together with Christ Eph 2:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord" Prov 20:27, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the time of regeneration the Holy Spirit comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He enters into man's spirit like the lighting of a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the "new spirit" spoken of in Ezekiel 36:26.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because the old spirit was dead, the Holy Spirit puts the uncreated life of God inside it, causing it to have life and to live.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before regeneration, man's soul ruled over his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His "self" dominated his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His lust governed his body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The soul became the life of the spirit, the "self" became the life of the soul, and the lust became the life of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After man's regeneration, the Holy Spirit rules his spirit, causing his spirit to govern his soul, then through the soul to rule over his body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now the Holy Spirit becomes the life of the spirit, and the spirit becomes the life of the entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the time of regeneration the Holy Spirit revives the human spirit and renews it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Bible, regeneration refers to the step in which a man comes out of death and enters into life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This regeneration, like the physical birth, occurs only once, and once is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is at this time of rebirth that man receives God's own life, is born of God, and becomes God's child.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Being renewed" in the Bible refers to the Holy Spirit's work of increasingly filling and permeating our being with His life and thus completely overcoming our life in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a lengthy, continuous, and progressive work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In such a regenerated one, the original order of the spirit and the soul is restored.</S>
