   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fierce Wolves Entering the Flock</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Acts 20, as Paul traveled to Jerusalem on his return from his third journey, he passed through Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He spoke prophetically when he said to the elders in Ephesus, After my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The apostle sensed within his spirit that corruption would enter the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not despise the apostle s word that fierce wolves will enter the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fierce wolves coming in among a flock of sheep is a serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Galatians 2:11-14 there was a small problem with Peter, but he was not a fierce wolf coming in among the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter was more like a slightly sick sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, Paul said that fierce wolves would come into the church in Ephesus; these were false, evil men who came into the church speaking heresy and leading people astray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Preaching Christ Because of Envy and Strife</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time the book of Philippians was written, the desolation of the church had become more serious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1:15, Paul says, Some preach Christ even because of envy and strife.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that some people even preached the gospel because of envy and strife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They preached the gospel in this way in order to oppose the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, when Paul wrote the book of Philippians from a Roman prison, the church was in chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the age of the apostles there were those who did gospel work out of envy and strife.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1934 the Japanese imprisoned and interrogated me, but they could not charge me with any crime.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One day they brought me out of my cell and asked me why people in Christianity had nothing good to say about me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I carefully considered how to answer because my interrogator was an unbeliever and also one of the invading Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I could not speak poorly of my fellow Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, even those who had nothing good to say about me were members of the church of God, and I could not speak negatively about the church to an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was a difficult question, and if I did not give a good answer, it would create trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I had to follow the Lord s word in Matthew 10:18-20, not trusting in myself before officials but relying completely on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit within gave me the words to speak, and I said, Those who are in the same line of business are usually envious one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you and I both sold cloth, then I would hope that you would go out of business so that my business would prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why the Chinese have a proverb which speaks of people in the same line of business being enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My Japanese interrogator immediately laughed and expressed his agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I did not say that others were wrong or that I was right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I only said that they had nothing good to say about me because of envy, that is, because people in the same line of business are enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If my business fails, all the people in my line of business will love and pity me; however, if my business is successful, my competitors will hate me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although this scenario does not sound pleasant, it has been happening for two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even in Philippians 1 there was such a degraded situation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Timothy does not speak much about the desolation of the church, but 2 Timothy is almost entirely on this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>J. N. Darby once said that the second books in the New Testament are all on the desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the case with 2 Corinthians, 2 Timothy, 2 Peter, and 2 and 3 John.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even the Epistle to the church in Ephesus in Revelation 2:1-7 is a kind of 2 Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Darby thought that all the second books concerned the desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although this is not strictly accurate, it is still quite reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Among the Epistles that touch the desolation of the church, the second books have much more to say than the first books.</S>
