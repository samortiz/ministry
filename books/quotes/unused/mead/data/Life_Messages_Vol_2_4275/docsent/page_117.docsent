   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TERMINOLOGY OR EXPERIENCE?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may be tired of hearing me speak so much about the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may be of the opinion that this is my only topic.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may wonder how much I know of various doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why has this been my pet subject for thirty years?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you will excuse me for saying so, I could easily teach courses on prophecy and typology.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am all too familiar with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I no longer have any interest in these subjects, however.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is only the matter of the spirit which burdens me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more I speak on this, the heavier my burden becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By now you are probably familiar with the terminology regarding the spirit, from having heard or read so many of my messages on the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How much time, however, do you actually spend in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not including your eight hours of sleep, how many of the remaining hours of the day do you live in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I ask myself this question also.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Within me I am sometimes rebuked by the Lord that with all my speaking about the spirit, much of the time I do not remain there myself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE EFFORT REQUIRED</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To live in the other parts of your being, no effort is required.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is natural to be in your flesh and to be loose, doing as you will in a careless way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To stay in your mind with all its considerations and analyses is a comfortable place to be, especially for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To live in your emotions and react according to their dictates is common, especially for the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It may be that when you pray, you are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Most of the time you spend in prayer, however, you may still be in your emotions, weeping, or in your mind, figuring things out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may exercise your spirit when you come to the meetings, but usually your calling on the Lord sounds hollow, because your daily life is not spent in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though we are in the churches of the Lord's recovery, we too neglect our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once again I would like to try to persuade you of its importance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man can be likened to a radio.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit of God is like the heavenly radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The spirit in man is like the radio receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many radios do not function because their owners do not use their spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>People are unable to contact God because the receiver within them is out of order.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I would remind you again how much importance God gives to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Zechariah 12:1 tells us that the Lord "stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here are the important things in the universe the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The verse does not even say man, but rather the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You bathe regularly to make sure your body is clean, but this verse focuses on the spirit, not the body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you care about your spirit being clean?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's concern is for the spirit, but man's attention is devoted to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The body is just clay; it is the spirit which is precious.</S>
