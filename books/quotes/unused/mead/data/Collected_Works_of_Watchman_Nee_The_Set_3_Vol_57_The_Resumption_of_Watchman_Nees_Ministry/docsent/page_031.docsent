   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING AN ABSOLUTE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to see that the whole problem rests with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to realize how great our responsibility is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of our unfaithfulness, we dare not preach the complete gospel to the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must be transformed before we can preach a transforming gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must be different before we can preach a different gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There must be a recovered person before there can be a recovered gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There must be men who are coordinated before there can be the gospel that brings in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are not a certain type of person, we can never preach that certain type of gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must be men of Acts 2 before we can preach the gospel of Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only then will we produce more men of Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If your family, career, money, or position is your center, I have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But I can tell you that you cannot be a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unless we ourselves are the right kind of person, we can never expect others to be the right kind of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are not absolute, in twenty or thirty years God will raise up men who will be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether or not God will find a way in this generation depends on whether there are absolute people in this generation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE IMPACT OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the early churches, although the number of saved ones was not too great, there were men who were on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although many of them did not preach much, what they said at the time of their martyrdom spoke louder than what we preach for a whole lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is needed today is nothing less than absolute obedience and absolute consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are the things that will bring in the power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In his book The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon described the sufferings of the martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were persecuted, exiled, and often abused by the Roman soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet the more the persecution came, the more people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The question today is how much has the gospel laid hold of us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more the gospel lays hold of us, the greater the impact of the gospel will be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether or not we can cause the next generation to be a people of Acts 2 depends on how well we perform today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The question is whether or not we are willing to be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The recovery may come to a halt when it comes to us, or it may have a new breakthrough from us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If God gains His way through us, those who are saved after us will not be like the saved ones we see today; a better breed will emerge.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What others say and criticize is not important to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The important thing is the kind of persons we are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our God is a God who is always going on.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father works until now, and the Son also works John 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we offer up all our time, money, and everything, power will come.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the beginning the Lord demanded that the believers sacrifice their lives to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The calling today is more serious than it was then.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Formerly, we may have exhorted others to believe in the Lord by giving them a pat on the back and saying nice words to them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But today asking others to believe in the Lord is the same as asking for their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Formerly, we begged others to believe, as if they were granting us a favor by believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today the situation has turned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man must realize that believing in the Lord will cost him his very life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am afraid that there are not many places on earth where the kind of message we have today is preached.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE WAY TO GO ON</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to match God's work, the way before us needs some adjustments.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I can mention a few of these.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, there is the need to train people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In training people, we need to pay attention to the vessels themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The vessels must be right before the work can be right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Second, we have to strengthen our existing works.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Third, we have to learn to judge others and to deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to stop those who are too much and strengthen those who are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the future we will judge the world and the angels 1 Cor 6:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, we have to learn to judge today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first one we have to learn to judge is ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not judge ourselves, our judgment will not be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we ourselves have been dealt with, our judgments will be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who are the ministers of the word should especially learn the proper lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the same time, all the brothers and sisters should learn to receive the portion of the ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Fourth, money must have no place in the heart of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The co-workers must be delivered from the bondage of money.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Any feeling for money in the co-workers must be completely taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We hope that the Lord will work to such an extent that we can have all things in common in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Fifth, the local churches should pay much attention to the newly saved ones, to properly equip them and to render them the clear teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Two kinds of perfectings are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One is the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This must be done year round in all the places.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The other is the edification of the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This needs a few dozen topics with which we educate the new believers week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These topics are fixed topics; there is no need to devise more advanced topics.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The same topics can be used year round.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who will serve as the speaking vessels need to learn these topics first.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They should also know how to use the adequate materials.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some brothers should remain in a place to wait on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some should spend more time traveling to other places, while the rest stay in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Everyone should learn to work together as a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There should not be a church that is tied to its own "turf,'' one that is closed to outsiders.</S>
