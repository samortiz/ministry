<p>The main significance of Christ being everything to us is that He is our life (Col. 3:4). He is much more than the One who delivers and assists; He is our life, nature, person, and innate character so that He may become our content and our everything. In addition to having our natural human life, God has given Christ to us as our life so that we would no longer live by our own life but, instead, would take His life as our life and His nature as our nature. Consequently, Christ becomes us, and we become Him; that is, He and we are not just the same, but we are one. He is our inner content, and we are His outer appearance. He is our life, and we are His expression. Just as Christ has the life and nature of God and lives because of Him, Christ becomes our life and nature so that we can live because of Him (John 6:57). When we take Him as our life and live by Him, those who touch us outwardly sense that Christ is our inner content.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST LIVING AND ABIDING IN US</h2>
<p>Christ is in us as our life. This means that He wants to live in us (Gal. 2:20). We should not only take Him as our life; we should also let Him live in us. All the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ. Hence, when He lives in us, He abides in us and expresses all the riches of the Godhead from within us. This can be compared to the growing and spreading of a vine through its branches.</p>
<p>As believers, we all face a problem when it comes to Christ living in us. Even though we are saved, we still have our own views and concepts concerning how to be a Christian. Some believers think that a Christian should be humble and meek, and others think that a Christian should be loving, sympathetic, and generous. Other believers think that a Christian should have proper behavior and be righteous in everything. There are believers who think that Christians should be zealous to preach the gospel. Others believe that children of God should be simple and plain in their adornment. There are many concepts concerning how to be a Christian. Even though we are saved, we are controlled by our concepts, and we try to cultivate in ourselves what we think a good and proper Christian should be. However, being a Christian is not a matter of self-cultivation but of letting Christ live in us and live out from us. A Christian should have surpassingly excellent virtues, but these virtues are not the result of self-cultivation. These virtues are the issue of allowing Christ to live in us and to live out from us. Our virtues should be Christ, that is, Christ living out from us.</p>
<p>Self-cultivation is a natural human concept, but living out Christ requires spiritual revelation from God. For example, a sister who is irritable and has a bad temper often has a natural concept that she needs to be delivered from her temper. She does not know that God&rsquo;s intention is for her to live out Christ, not for her to be delivered from her temper. Since she is short of divine revelation, she will strive to improve herself according to her concept. Knowing that she is weak and unable to improve herself, she also will pray to the Lord for help. In her actual experience, however, she cannot improve herself, and the Lord does not answer her prayer for help. Instead, He allows her to fail until she is disappointed with herself and no longer tries to improve herself. At this point, she can receive revelation from God to see that being a Christian is not a matter of improving oneself but of living out Christ. God&rsquo;s desire is not for Christ to help us improve ourselves. God&rsquo;s desire is for Christ to live in us so that we may live out Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING FORMED IN US</h2>
<p>Christ is not only living in us but also being formed in us (4:19). Christ being formed in us is for the purpose of His being our life. He has been born in us through the Spirit, but He still needs to grow in us. As long as we afford Him the opportunity, He will cause the riches of the Godhead to grow and be formed in us, just as all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him.</p>
<p>The expression <em>being formed</em> does not only mean that Christ is in us to be our life so that we may have His nature and power. It means that He is growing in us so that all the riches of the Godhead may become our life and our living. Even though we have the human life and nature, God wants Christ to grow in us until He becomes our life and nature. God wants Christ to develop in us until He is fully grown and formed in us. In order for Christ to be formed in us, we need to know Christ as the Spirit, and by the Spirit we need to deny our self through the cross and live by Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Christ is our life, He lives in us, and He is being formed in us so that we may be transformed into His image (2 Cor. 3:18). If we take Him as our life, live by Him, and let Him grow and be formed in us to become the essential element in every part of our being, we will be transformed into His image to be like Him in life and nature, including in our mind, emotion, and will. This is the principal work of the Spirit within us. On the one hand, the Spirit reveals Christ in us so that He may become everything to us through our knowledge and experience of Him. On the other hand, the Spirit transforms us into the image of Christ, from glory to glory, through our knowing, experiencing, and gaining of Him as our all. With Christ as the mold, the Spirit is working within us and regulating us from without to conform us to the image of Christ so that we may be like Him (Rom. 8:29).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
