   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Shulammite Typifying</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Church in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is typified by Solomon, whom the Shulammite enjoyed and experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Shulammite, as a type of the church, centers on the church in resurrection and the way that the church enjoys and experiences the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the church to be in resurrection means that the church is experiencing and enjoying the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without resurrection, the church could not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, there is no church apart from resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Body of Christ is not natural or of the old creation; rather, the Body of Christ is in resurrection and of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Christ whom we have received is the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We met Him as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 7:38 the Lord said, He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then verse 39 continues, But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that as the Spirit, Christ is in resurrection and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Christ whom we have received and whom we contact daily is the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason that we can experience Christ is that He is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If He were not in resurrection, we would have no way to contact and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the church, we can enjoy our Solomon-Christ and rest with Him in the love feast whenever we contact Him, because He is in resurrection and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to our condition today, we do not have full rest in Christ, nor does Christ have full rest in us; however, we do have some rest, and this rest is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The records of Eve and Rebekah end with their marriages, but the record of the Shulammite begins with her marriage and the living of her marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This marriage life is a life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After Eve came out of Adam, she joined with him to become one, and her story ends there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After Rebekah was married to Isaac, little is recorded about her, and what is recorded does not typify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Shulammite s record, however, begins with her marriage and the living of her marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Her marriage life is a life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The wedding feast of the Lamb will be in the future, but in resurrection we have already been married to Christ, we are living a marriage life, and we are in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our present marriage life is a foretaste of the life in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The focus of the Shulammite as a type is the church in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is not only united with Christ but is also living a marriage life with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Meaning of Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In regard to the Lord, resurrection has two aspects, and also in regard to us, resurrection has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In John 11:25 the Lord said, I am the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The I in John 11:25 is equivalent to God in 1:1: In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The focus on the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of John is different from the other three Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whereas the focus in the other Gospels is on His humanity, the focus in the Gospel of John is on His being God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, when the Lord said, I am the resurrection, I refers to His being God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 11:25 He said, I am the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is not a similar statement in the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Luke the Lord Jesus is portrayed as a man, in Mark He is portrayed as a slave, and in Matthew He is portrayed as a King.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These three accounts have many similarities in terms of history, geography, and miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Gospel of John, however, is uniquely different.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Gospel of John emphasizes the fact that the Lord Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, He said, I am the resurrection and the life, meaning that resurrection and life are God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Resurrection is life, and life is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God and resurrection coexist.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because there is God, there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Resurrection did not come into being three days after the Lord Jesus crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Just as God Himself is not bound by time, resurrection is not bound by time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In John 11 Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus replied, Your brother will rise again, to which Martha responded, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you believe this? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>21-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Martha tried to put resurrection into time, but the fact is that resurrection is not bound by time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Resurrection is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever there is God, there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What is the real significance of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order to understand spiritual experience, we must know resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Resurrection is not merely life; rather, it is life that has passed through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In other words, resurrection is life plus that which cannot be detained or restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Possessing life is not the same as possessing resurrection; resurrection is life plus something that cannot be detained or restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A seed can be compared to a grain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we plant this life into the soil to bury and constrict it, it resists death from within.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When this life emerges from the soil, it is resurrection, even though it is still life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Resurrection is defined in 1 Corinthians 15.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Resurrection is not merely life but a life that cannot be held by anything, not even by death Acts 2:24-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our God is not only life but resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He cannot be held or constricted by any matter or thing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is able to break through any and every circumstance, person, matter, or thing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nothing can oppress Him or bind Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Any kind of chain means nothing to Him and has no effect on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, the meaning of resurrection is that life breaks through all bondage, oppression, and imprisonment and is not held by them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God being life and God being resurrection are different in significance.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God being resurrection is more emphatic than God being life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As resurrection, life cannot be oppressed, bound, or held by any kind of environment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It overcomes death and cannot be held by death.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Resurrection did not come into being three days after the Lord s crucifixion; rather, it existed before the creation of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the beginning, in eternity, God was life and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>One day, this life, which is God, entered into flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The flesh became His confinement and prison.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God was willing to enter into this prison and be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>During the last three and a half years that the Lord was on the earth, He was despised, persecuted, interrogated, rebuked, and beaten by men; He suffered all kinds of humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Outwardly, His suffering was immense, and as Jesus the Nazarene, He was despised.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Nevertheless, inwardly He was full of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Resurrection was His power within.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This resurrection is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord was able to take the way of Jesus the Nazarene because He was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Resurrection did not come into being when, after having experienced birth, human living, and death, He was raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It existed in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Resurrection is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This resurrection came into a man who lived in all kinds of negative environments, including men s persecution, oppression, and harassment; therefore, nothing could hold Him down, constrict Him, or confine Him, because He is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>For thirty-three and a half years Satan, who has the might of death, tried his best to hold down resurrection by binding and limiting God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If God had not entered into flesh, Satan would have had no way to bind Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God, however, came in the flesh, into Satan s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>God seemed to be saying, Come on, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I will let you bind Me. Heap all that you are upon Me, and try to hold Me down.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In the end, Satan loaded death upon resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>However, as Acts 2 reveals, even death could not hold Him, much less trouble Him even a little.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Death could not bind Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He broke through death and came out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Resurrection existed before Christ entered into death.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In Philippians 3:10 the apostle Paul says, To know Him and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The power of resurrection is God Himself, the God who is able to raise the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Lord Jesus was first Jesus, then the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He first lived the life of a Nazarene, and then He lived the glory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This glory is something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Before being raised from the dead, He told Martha and Mary that He was the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>During the Lord s human living, Satan heaped every negative matter and thing upon Him, but He came out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This proves that He is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When we believed into the Lord, we did not only believe into the Lord who became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We also believed into the Lord who died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Romans 10:9 says, If you...believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We do not believe into a crucified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Throughout the entire Bible, we cannot find an expression that says that we believe in the crucifixion of Jesus or that we believe into the crucified Jesus but rather that we believe into the resurrected Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When we believe into Him, the resurrected Lord comes into us to become our resurrection from within.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This word may sound difficult, but it is easy to understand in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>When we believed in the Lord, we may have encountered persecution and harassment from men.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Outwardly, we were pressed and in pain, but inwardly there was a power that caused us to feel glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Although we may have wept outwardly, we were joyful inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>That power, glory, and joy are resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>They are Christ, as Solomon, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>The Shulammite typifies the glorified church in the future, and she also typifies the church in resurrection today.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The type of the Shulammite is not merely objective in the future; she is subjective and for our experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>From God s perspective, resurrection is divided into two stages.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The first stage was in eternity before its manifestation, and the second stage is in time and is its manifestation, which began three days after the Lord Jesus crucifixion when He was raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Before that day, resurrection existed.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>At times, it was manifested to a limited degree.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>A small manifestation of resurrection occurred on the day of the Lord Jesus transfiguration on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>During His last three and a half years on the earth, He never fell or failed, and no matter how people oppressed and threatened Him, He never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>This also was a manifestation of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Resurrection is not something that man can produce; it can only be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>During the Boxer Rebellion a brother was saved because he saw and was touched by the manifestation of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>At that time he was only a teenager, an apprentice in a store in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>At the peak of the Boxers s rioting, when they were brutally killing the Christians, many stores in the city closed.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>One day he was in the store.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Upon hearing the shouting and crying in the street, he peeked through a crack in the door and saw some of the Boxers with turbans on their heads and swords in their hands, ferociously escorting a wagon on which a twenty-year-old woman was being carried to the execution ground.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>She was to be put to death because she was not willing to deny the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Anyone would be frightened in such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>In those days the girls in China rarely went out of their rooms or houses, but strangely the young woman sitting in the wagon was not at all afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>She was rejoicing and singing hymns of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>When the young man in the store saw this scene, he was deeply touched and impressed with what he had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>He received the Lord because of what he saw, and later he gave up everything, saying, I also want to go out to preach the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>On that day, when the sister was being dragged away by the Boxers to be executed, resurrection was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Before the Lord Jesus died and resurrected, He suffered much pain and difficulties caused by men; however, in every situation He manifested resurrection until, one day, He entered fully into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>This is the scene of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Today the church is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>One day, all the dead saints will be raised, and all the living saints will be transfigured and raptured, and we will enter fully into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>However, even before that day comes, we can live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Today resurrection is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Many times we suffer reproach and hardship from men and are confronted with tests and temptations; nevertheless, we are able to stand because we still have God s presence and the Lord s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>The result is the manifestation of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Both in relation to the Lord Jesus and to us, there are two stages of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>In regard to the church in resurrection, typified by the Shulammite, there are also two stages; however, the emphasis is not on the second stage but the first, that is, in regard to our subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>The Shulammite s living with Solomon in the palaces of ivory typifies the church fellowshipping with Christ in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>The emphasis is not on resurrection in the future but on living in resurrection today.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>To be a Christian is to be one who lives in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Christians are those who live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Only those who are in resurrection are Christians; those who are in themselves are not Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>God never intended for us to take the way of the cross by our own strong perseverance and reliance on ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Instead, He comes into us in resurrection to be our power, supporting and motivating us to take the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>Outwardly speaking, the way of the cross is harsh, but those who take this way realize that there is a power within them.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>This power is God coming into us in resurrection to be our Solomon, supporting and motivating us to take the way that David took and to live the life that David lived.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>We are Solomon inwardly and David outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>Inwardly we are the Shulammite, and outwardly we are Abigail.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>These are not two separate experiences; rather, the two exist simultaneously, one being inward and the other being outward.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>To a certain degree, we have experienced being Solomon and David.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>Even though we suffer difficulties and hardships and are sons of sorrow who are persecuted and wander about in the wilderness, within there are a power and a fellowship that are sweet and glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>We have God, the Spirit, and Solomon the resurrected Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Hence, the apostle Paul could say, To know...the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>Inwardly, Christ, as typified by Solomon, enables us to take the way of Jesus the Nazarene, as typified by David.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>A Christian with this kind of experience is deep and matches the biblical standard.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>Although the marriage of the Lamb will take place in the future, according to our experience, in resurrection we have already been united with and married to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>In resurrection we are already the New Jerusalem and are living our marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>According to the central focus of the type of the Shulammite, our life is a life of foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>In resurrection the church has been united with Christ and is one with Him.</S>
