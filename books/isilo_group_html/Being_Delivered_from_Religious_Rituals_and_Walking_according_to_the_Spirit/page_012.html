<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING NEW AND OUTSIDE RELIGION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DETESTING DEATH</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus was born in a religious nation where Judaism originated, but everything related to Him, including His birth, took place outside religion and had nothing to do with religion. This was not an accident or a coincidence; it was God&rsquo;s arrangement and ordination. Man likes religion, but God detests religion. From man&rsquo;s point of view, religion is better than sin, the world, and the flesh with its lusts, and religion renders a certain amount of help to communities and societies. From God&rsquo;s point of view, however, religion is deceitful, because it undermines God&rsquo;s work by causing man to reject the living God. Hence, religion is God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<p>We must receive this word with much prayer. If a young saint would go to a dance club or visit an improper place, we would be quite concerned, but if he comes to the meeting with his Bible and sits in a well-behaved manner, we would praise him. It is easy to understand that a Christian should not be in a sinful place like a dance club, but few of us realize that it is also improper for a Christian to devoutly attend a meeting in a dead and formal way. We condemn the practice of going to a dance club, but we do not condemn the practice of coming to a meeting in a dead and formal way.</p>
<p>Many saints who used to attend dance clubs have confessed this matter to the Lord and asked for forgiveness. However, how many saints have ever confessed to participating in a meeting in a dead and formal way? I doubt that many saints have confessed this, because in our concept going to a dance club is a sin, but attending a meeting is an honorable thing. In God&rsquo;s eyes, however, death is no less defiling than sin.</p>
<p>Because we have a concept of morality, our consideration of what is a sin is quite clear to us. Because we do not have the concept of life, however, we have very little realization related to death. God detests sin, but He detests death even more. He is not only a holy and righteous God who detests sin and the world; even more, He is a living God who detests death. Going to a dance club is in the realm of sin, but attending a meeting in a formal way is in the realm of death. Even if there are five hundred people in a meeting that is dead, it is still an insult to God. This is something that we must confess and repent of and ask for the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness.</p>
<p>Perhaps some saints cannot accept this word. They may say that they are not dead and that they do not meet in a dead way or attend a dead meeting. I would ask whether a living person can remain inactive for two hours. Before a living person enters the meeting room, others will hear the voice of his joyful prayers: &ldquo;Hallelujah! Amen! Praise the Lord!&rdquo; Since we have a concept of morality but not a concept of life, some saints say that they do not like the meetings in which others are noisy. Those who have children know that the more living the children are, the noisier the home will be. If a family has five children between the ages of two and nine, it will be impossible for their home to be quiet and orderly. If the home is quiet and orderly, it may be because all five children are sick, or they are all dead. If they are dead, that home will be very quiet, and it will surely be tidy, without any confusion. The children will no longer fight or quarrel. If, however, the five children are neither sick nor dead, they will be active and lively, even causing problems. Although they may be troublesome to others, they will be living.</p>
<p>I have many grandchildren, and when they come to visit, they are like a team of destroyers. Everything in my living room must be removed before they come; otherwise, in less than five minutes they will break everything. Do you prefer children who are sick or dead to those who are active, lively, and messy? In the same principle, when the saints are dead in their spirit, our meetings are quiet and orderly, but when we call &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; and are living, it is not possible to be orderly. This does not mean that we should not be orderly. However, sometimes when we are living, we will not be concerned about being orderly. Man cares for religion, but God cares for life. God does not want religion. He wants us to be living.</p>
<p>In John 5 during a certain feast, the Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem. A feast should be a happy occasion. However, near the sheepgate in Jerusalem there was a pool with five porticoes where many sick people lay, waiting for the moving of the water. These people were sick, lame, blind, and withered. These sick ones did not have any rest, because they were very sick. One man had been in his sickness for thirty-eight years and could not move. The Lord Jesus went to this pool on the Sabbath and spoke to the man who had been sick for thirty-eight years, asking him if he wanted to get well. Then the Lord said, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk.&rdquo; Immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. This was on the Sabbath. Therefore, the Jews said to this man, &ldquo;It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat&rdquo; (vv. 1-10). The Jews were saying that it was unlawful for the man to take up his mat and walk on the Sabbath, because he was profaning the Sabbath. Does God want man to keep a dead Sabbath by lying down and suffering, or does God want man to be enlivened?</p>
<p>Christians have held many dead Sunday services. God wants to do a work that is contrary to religion. The end time is approaching&mdash;Jerusalem has been returned to Israel, and the Lord is returning soon. In these days God wants to move faster. When a person wants to move faster, he does not care about being elegant. Since God wants to move faster, He does not care for religious rituals and ordinances. Everything about the Lord Jesus took place outside religion. His star was shown to those outside religion, the way people sought Him was outside religion, and the way people followed Him was also outside religion. If we are in religion, we will miss the Lord.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Delivered from Religious Rituals and Walking according to the Spirit &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
