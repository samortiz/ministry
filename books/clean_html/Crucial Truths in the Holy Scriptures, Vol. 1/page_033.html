<h2 class="head2">In the Aspect of the Blood</h2>
<p>Although we are saved and cleansed by God and although we have the Spirit of God and the life of the Lord leading us to live a holy life and walk in a pure pathway, we often fall, fail, sin, and become defiled. For this reason God continues to wash us instantly with the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from every sin&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>From the moment of our salvation until the redemption of our bodies, the Lord&rsquo;s blood cleanses us from our sins continually to restore the cleanness that we obtained when we were saved. In the original language, <em>cleanses</em> means a constant and continual cleansing.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>If we are defiled by sin&mdash;unrighteousness&mdash;after our salvation, we must confess our sins to God, who will forgive us and restore our cleanness.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 7:14; see also 22:14).</p>
<p><em>Robes</em> refers to the works of the saints after their salvation (19:8). Although our works may be contaminated by sin after we are saved, we can wash them and make them white by the Lord&rsquo;s blood. We must confess our sins to God instantly at all times to seek His cleansing (cf. Psa. 51:2, 7).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF CLEANSING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They will be as white as snow... / They will be like wool&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 1:18).</p>
<p>The result of God&rsquo;s cleansing us is that we become as white as snow and like wool. The whiteness of both snow and wool is natural. This shows that the result of God&rsquo;s cleansing is to make us not only white but even naturally white, as if we had never been defiled.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Whiter than snow&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 51:7).</p>
<p>The result of God&rsquo;s cleansing makes us not only as white as snow but even whiter than snow. How pure and white this is! Hallelujah!</p>
