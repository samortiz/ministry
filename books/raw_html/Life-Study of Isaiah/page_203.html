<P>We should not allow anything or anyone, including ourselves, to replace Christ. We need to be replaced by Christ. He Himself must be everything in us and to us.</P><P>Christ has a big key to open the treasury of all His riches. When He opens the treasury, no one will shut. When He shuts the treasury, no one will open. Christ is the One who can open up to us all the riches of God embodied in Him. He can also shut the door to these riches. Sometimes we experience the door of the divine treasures being open to us to flood into us. But at other times we may do something to offend the Lord. Then we have the sensation that the door is shut and that the riches coming to us are stopped. His opening and His shutting are all for one thing&#151;the enjoyment of His riches as the treasure.</P><P>I believe the direct application of Isaiah 22:22 is this&#151;Christ has the key to control the door of God's treasury, in which are the riches of God in Christ for our enjoyment. We have experienced both His opening of these riches to us and His shutting up of these riches. When He shuts up these riches, we have the feeling of being dried up or inwardly deprived. Our experience indicates that Christ is the One who has the key to all of His riches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE ONE WHOM GOD DRIVES<br>AS A PEG (NAIL) INTO A SURE PLACE<br>(THE HEAVENS INTO WHICH CHRIST WAS EXALTED)</H2><P>Christ is the One whom God drives as a peg, or nail, into a sure place (Isa. 22:23a). In typology, the sure place typifies the third heaven (cf. 2 Cor. 12:2b). Christ was raised up from the dead, and He was exalted to the third heaven where God is. Actually, to be exalted to the third heaven is to be exalted to God the Father because the Father is in the third heaven. In Luke 15:18 the Lord Jesus relates the story of the prodigal son saying, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you." Against heaven equals before you (God the Father). Sinning against heaven is sinning before God because God the Father is in heaven (Matt. 6:9). Heaven, referring to the heavens, is the sure place where God the Father is.</P><P>Without the book of Isaiah, we would not know that when God exalted Christ, God drove Him as a peg into the place where He is, the heavens. Christ today is in the heavens as a peg driven into God. He is the peg upon which all of us hang. Sometimes when I was in a plane flying to another locality, the devil injected a thought into me that the plane in which I was flying would drop. My response to this thought was, "I am not actually in this plane; I am in Christ." In other words, I am not hanging on the plane; I am hanging on Christ. Christ is the peg on which I hang. The sisters may think that they are hanging on their husbands. They need to realize that their husbands are not good, trustworthy "hangers." The best hanger is Christ who has been driven into God in the heavenlies.</P>
