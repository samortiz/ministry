   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CULTURE AN ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:8, 18, and 20, Paul mentions a number of matters: philosophy, tradition, elements of the world, humility, angel worship, and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, all these items can be summed up in one word culture.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Philosophy is one of the highest products of man s culture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Tradition also is related to culture.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In fact, tradition comes from culture, and culture is embodied in tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there is no culture, there is no tradition; and if there is no tradition, there can be no culture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, the elements of the world, which are rudimentary principles of basic teachings, are also aspects of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Humility is a virtue found among the most cultured of people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more refined and cultured a person is, the more humble he is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the more uncultured and barbarous a person is, the less humble he is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, humility is intimately related to cultural refinement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the worship of angels is found among people of high culture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those with a rather low culture may worship beasts, but those who are more highly cultured may worship angels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The worship of angels is actually a refined form of idolatry, a practice still to be found in today s Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some people may even justify the worship of angels by arguing that it is better than the worship of animals.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Finally, man s ordinances are related to his culture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ordinances are rules related to our way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, table manners are ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more cultured people are, the more ordinances they have.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more cultured a person is, the more he will say, Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the word culture is not found in Colossians, actually this book was written to deal with culture, a real enemy to our experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All people appreciate their culture and value it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason, it is a hindrance to the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the section of Colossians dealing with the practical experience of Christ, Paul lists many things that frustrate this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The items mentioned in Colossians are very different from those listed in 1 Corinthians, where Paul deals with division, jealousy, fornication, and lawsuits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Galatians Paul deals with the law as a frustration to the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in Colossians he comes to the deeply hidden and subtle matter of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christians condemn fornication and divisiveness and for the most part realize that the law is over.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But who repudiates culture as a hindrance to the enjoyment of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even among us there are very few who condemn culture for this reason.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church in Colosse had been invaded by a mixture of Jewish and Greek culture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Elements of Gnosticism and asceticism had made inroads into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both Gnosticism and asceticism are products of highly-developed cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who practice asceticism, the severe treatment of the body, are usually refined, cultured people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to keep in mind that the book of Colossians was written not to deal with sin or the law, but to deal with culture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Christ revealed in Colossians cannot be experienced unless the cultural hindrances have been exposed and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may hold on to our culture and experience the Christ revealed in other New Testament books.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the experience of the all-inclusive Christ unfolded in Colossians requires that we repudiate the frustration presented by our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Colossians Paul first presents the objective revelation and then the subjective ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Coming to the practical experience of Christ in chapter two, he points out that the most subtle hindrance to the enjoyment of Christ is our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Concerning the objective revelation of Christ, the book of Colossians gives us the highest revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the same principle, concerning the practical experience of Christ, this book points out the most subtle frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May we all be impressed with the fact that if we would have the practical experience of the all-inclusive Christ, we must deal with our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some of those who see the importance of laying aside culture may claim that they have already done so.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The American saints may claim to have dropped their American culture, and the Chinese believers may claim to have dropped their Chinese culture.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, they may not have dropped their self-made culture, the culture they themselves have developed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, by dropping our culture we may simply devise another culture a culture-dropping culture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In such a case, we replace our culture, not with Christ, but with a non-culture culture.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The crucial point is not that we drop our culture it is that we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The issue is not culture versus no culture; it is culture versus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to care for Christ and live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, the important thing is not that we attempt to drop our culture negatively; it is that we live Christ positively.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Children must be raised according to certain cultural standards.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Otherwise, they will be wild and unruly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a serious mistake for Christian parents to tell their children that they do not need culture, but only need to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Children need culture until they are old enough to experience Christ and live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Anyone who has not received Christ must have culture in order to live properly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today s society needs culture.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more cultured people are, the less they need to be controlled by the police or by the law court.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I wish to make it emphatically clear that I am not saying that we should merely drop our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead of trying to lay aside culture, we should concentrate on gaining Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more we have of Christ, the less we shall need to live by culture.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually, everything we have apart from Christ is some form of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, to eat with a knife and fork is a matter of culture, and to eat with chopsticks is also a matter of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all have our own kind of self-made and self-imposed culture.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This means that we all have our particular way to live.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You live according to your way, and I live according to mine.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To live according to our way is to live according to our culture.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As we have pointed out, this is the greatest frustration to the enjoyment of Christ and its ultimate enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, let us care more and more for the experience of Christ and for living Christ in a practical way day by day.</S>
