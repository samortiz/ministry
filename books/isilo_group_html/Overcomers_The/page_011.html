This shows us that millions have been deceived by Catholicism. They do not realize that what they are in is something false and even satanic and devilish. The main thing in Revelation 17 is that the Lord has fixed a day for Antichrist and his ten kings to desolate and burn the Roman Catholic Church. Revelation 2:24 tells us that the deep things of Satan are within this apostate church. This is satanic and devilish. The Lord will tolerate this up to the beginning of the great tribulation when the Roman Catholic Church will be terminated by Antichrist.<p>Now we have to consider today&#8217;s Protestant churches in the light of the divine revelation. The most significant thing in the Protestant churches is that they are full of nominal Christians, false Christians. In Matthew 13 the Lord uses the tares to signify the false Christians. Among the fifty-five million Catholics and sixty-five million Protestants in the United States, how many are real believers and how many are false ones? In the true church, all are saved, blood-washed, Spirit-regenerated believers. Many in the Protestant churches today, however, are not genuine believers in Christ; instead, they are tares, false Christians. Concerning the destiny of the tares, the Lord said that they would be collected and cast into the lake of fire at the consummation of this age (Matt. 13:30, 40-42).<p>In today&#8217;s Christendom there are the wheat, the real believers, and the tares, the false ones. While the tares and the wheat are growing together, they are difficult to differentiate. It is impossible to distinguish wheat from tares until the fruit is produced. The wheat brings forth yellow fruit, and the tares bring forth something black. Often it is hard to discern who is a real Christian and who is a false one in today&#8217;s Christendom. Concerning the wheat and the tares, the Lord said, &#8220;Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn&#8221; (Matt. 13:30). This will take place when the Lord Jesus comes back at the end of the great tribulation. The Lord will send the angels to bind all the false Christians into bundles, and they will be cast into the lake of fire (Matt. 13:42). In this way the Lord Jesus will clear up the mixture.<p>At the beginning of the great tribulation, Antichrist with the ten kings will devastate and burn the Roman Catholic Church. Then after three and a half years, at the end of the great tribulation, the Lord Jesus will come back and send His angels to bind all the false Christians and throw them into the lake of fire. These are the two endings of the two &#8220;isms,&#8221; Catholicism and Protestantism. This is not according to my idea or teaching, but this is the divine revelation, showing us how these two &#8220;isms,&#8221; Catholicism and Protestantism, will be ended. First, Catholicism will be ended by Antichrist in the middle of the last seven years of this age, at the beginning of the great tribulation. Then Protestantism will be cleared up by the Lord at His coming back.<p>The biggest devastation to Christianity is the tares. This is why many people in the world condemn Christianity. When you try to talk to them about Christ, they think that you are trying to get them to accept Christianity. They see the evils and hypocrisy in Christianity. But in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today we do not preach Christianity. We preach Christ. We desire only Christ, not any &#8220;anity.&#8221; We do not preach any religion. We preach only a living person, and this living person is Christ as the very God who became a man and died on the cross for us. We preach this One so that people will believe into Him for their salvation. We are not convincing others to believe and receive Christianity. We are telling people that they need Christ, the person.<p>We need to be clear about these three &#8220;isms&#8221; on the earth today-Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. Judaism presently has about five million members in the United States. The United States has a population of about two hundred thirty million people, and over half of these are professing Christians in Catholicism and Protestantism. We need to realize that both Catholicism and Protestantism are condemned by God. One will be burned by fire on this earth, and the &#8220;tares&#8221; of the other will be burned by fire in the lake of fire. Therefore, we have to overcome the Jewish religion, the Catholic Church, and the Protestant churches.<p>Of course, there are a good number of saved, genuine believers in both the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches. But there is a mixture of saved ones and unsaved ones. Today in both the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches, many are real believers. This is why the Lord sounded the call for His people to come out of Babylon (Rev. 18:4). This calling tells us that the Lord does not feel good about His people remaining in Catholicism and Protestantism. This also shows that even the Lord Jesus admitted that there are real Christians in both the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches. Otherwise, He would not call His people to come out of Babylon.<p>Today the people of God need to overcome the three &#8220;isms&#8221; and come back to a unique, living, divine and human Person. He is our Savior, our God, our Redeemer, our Lord, and our Master, and He has nothing to do with any &#8220;anity.&#8221; He has nothing to do with any religion.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Overcomers &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
