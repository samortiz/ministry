   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAY-READING THE BIBLE VERSES OF EACH LESSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If there is some time left, you could go back to pray-read the main verses quoted in the lesson in order to impress them with such verses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Lesson One, John 6:47 is quoted which says, Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to lead the new contact to pray-read this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may say, Thank You, Lord, I believe in You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ask him to repeat this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a kind of leading pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may continue by saying, Has eternal life...has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, this is Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now, I believe in You, so I have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To impress them, ask them to pray this word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then this word will get into them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>LEADING THE NEW CONTACTS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TO SING THE PROPER SONGS AND HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To lead people to sing the proper songs or hymns is a little harder.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because you have to learn the hymns and songs and also learn to choose the proper ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The full-timers as well as all of the saints have to learn the songs, the hymns, the gospel songs, and the gospel hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our hymnal there are a lot of good songs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The message and the song do not have to match exactly in wording.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In wording the song might not be the same as the message, but in actuality it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For instance, there is a song whose first line of the chorus is: Since Jesus came into my heart Hymns, 309 and the phrase from John 6:47 says, He who believes in Me has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You can sing this hymn because it could be considered as a proper song on the assurance and joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>LEADING THE NEW ONES TO CONFESS THEIR SINS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THAT THEY MAY BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While you are helping the new ones to pray along with the lesson, you must take the lead to train them in their prayer to confess their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to take the lead to confess your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may say, Lord, I was born a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lord, even this day I have been mistaken, having done some things wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not make your prayer wordy or too long.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lead them into an atmosphere where they may spontaneously say, Lord, I am also sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Lord, even today I made a mistake with my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You could not do this by one visit but after many visits.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you go four times in a month to visit this family, surely you could train them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You will bring them into the Spirit, leading them to confess their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they would confess their sins with a long prayer, do not stop them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is a good sign.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let them pray, confessing their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They may say, O Lord, I offended my father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And I did something wrong with my mother.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If they confess many things, let them say it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more they would confess, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The ultimate consummation of a sin-confessing prayer is the filling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You do not need to teach them to seek after the filling of the Holy Spirit; they will have it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope that every time you go to a home, after a meeting has been set up, that your visit will end with the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every time bring the new contacts into the experience of the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, you do not need to point out to them so quickly that this is the experience of the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let them experience it a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There will be a time to let them know that what they have experienced is the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>HANDLING THE WORD, TOUCHING THE SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>SINGING, AND PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>ACCORDING TO THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When you go to nourish them, you must use these few steps which we have shared.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is hard to say which step should be first.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It may be that the Holy Spirit will lead you at the opening of the meeting to nourish them or you may take the lead to confess your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have to get yourself acquainted with all the New Life Lessons, and get yourself ready, going to the home meetings as a prepared and trained person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a trained person, you can use all the weapons and bullets in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This does not mean that you use this gun first, and that gun second, and this bullet last.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It all depends upon the atmosphere and the leading of the Holy Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the past, our reading of the word was not so living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We might have said, Let us read John 6:47.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then you might say, Let me read the first verse, and then you read the second.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is to read in a somewhat dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You must learn how to read a verse in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not just that you read and someone else listens.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is better for you and him to work together.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Make the reading living and coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This requires much practice.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To set up a meeting you must use the word, the Spirit, singing, and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is hard to say which point should be first.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But you must use these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The New Life Lessons are the word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Leading them to sing the proper songs and hymns involves singing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Leading them to pray-read the Bible verses involves praying.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Leading them to pray along with the lesson by confessing their sins that they may be filled with the Spirit involves the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The word, the Spirit, singing, and praying are the basic things involved in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You must be able to practice these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you can handle the word, touch the Spirit, know how to sing, and know how to pray, then you will have a good meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Every point in this chapter needs our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>GAINING PEOPLE BY NOURISHING THEM</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All of the nourished children love their mother.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Spiritually speaking, others will love you because you nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Because the mothers nourish the children, they spontaneously respond with love for her.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do you want your new contacts to love you?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You have to render them the best nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you continue to visit one home and establish a meeting full of nourishment, after five times that home will love you.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This means that you have gained them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If you would gain homes in this way the Lord will gain something and His recovery will be increasing and spreading.</S>
