   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Emmanuel God with Us a. In His Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may also experience and enjoy Christ as Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>" Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel,' which is translated, God with us " Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His humanity, Jesus, God incarnate, is Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jesus was the name given by God, whereas Emmanuel was the name called by man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus the Savior is God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is God incarnated to dwell among us John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is not only God but God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without Him we cannot meet God, for He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without Him we cannot find God, for He is God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, when we call on the Lord Jesus, we have the sense that God is with us. b.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For God to Meet Our Need in Every Way</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the complete God becoming a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, He is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing genuine divinity and real humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the almighty God, He has the capacity in His divinity and the capacity in His humanity to meet all of our need in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need Him in His divine capacity that we may be divine as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need Him in His humanity that we may be human as He is in the highest standard of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, by Him, with Him, and in Him we can be not only a proper and uplifted man but also a God-man, a divine man, as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is divine becoming human that we may be human becoming divine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is now humanly divine to make us divinely human.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way He, as the all-inclusive One, meets our need adequately and sufficiently in the most superior way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ passed through the processes of incarnation and resurrection in order to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through incarnation Christ could be Emmanuel outside of His believers, but this would fulfill only part of His intention in being with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His being with us outwardly does not fulfill His purpose to dispense Himself into our being, so He had to go through another process.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second process was His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In resurrection His physical form became a spiritual form.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through death and resurrection, He as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the life-giving Spirit, He is Emmanuel, the presence of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This presence is always with us in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , not only day by day but also moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To live with Christ, we need to be in His divine presence Gal 5:25a .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The divine presence is the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This presence is Emmanuel, who is the real, practical Jesus, the Triune God with the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We live with Christ as Emmanuel and walk by Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to walk by Christ as the life-giving Spirit, we must live with Christ as a person, who is Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today Emmanuel is the very life-giving Spirit, who is the consummated Triune God as His presence with us moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to realize that all day long we have another One with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is not only with us outwardly but also with us inwardly in our spirit every minute of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do and say things one way when we are alone, but when we have someone else with us, we do and say things differently.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must ask ourselves, "Are we doing things in our own way, or are we doing things in another way because we realize that another One is with us?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we realize that another One is with us, everything we do will change.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are very few Christians who walk, live, speak, and do things with Emmanuel as another One with them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have the doctrine of Emmanuel, but we have very little experience of Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we had more experience of Emmanuel, we would not do many of the things we do today, such as gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The presence of the Lord changes our life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all must have the realization and sensation that the Lord Jesus, who is our Savior, is also Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the Triune God with us, the tripartite men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not say or do anything in ourselves or by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to experience Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Living with Christ is not I living alone but with Christ living in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you live every day and every moment by yourself, you are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You must realize that you are no longer living alone, but Christ is living with you and in you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When you have this sensation, it will revolutionize your entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To live with Christ, we still live, yet not by ourselves alone but by Christ living with us as Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The name Emmanuel is first mentioned in Isaiah 7:14; 8:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many Christians address the Lord as Jesus and Christ, but few address the Lord as Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must learn to call our Lord, "Emmanuel."</S>
