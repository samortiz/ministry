 <h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETING</h2>
<p>There is a personal aspect as well as a corporate aspect of the grace that God gives to man. According to the personal aspect, we can receive grace when we read the Bible, pray, seek after God, and contact God. However, there is a corporate aspect of grace that can never be obtained through just our personal contact with God. It can be received only in the meetings.</p>
<p>We must also realize that the personal aspect of grace is not as weighty even though it is practical and necessary. But the corporate aspect of grace, the grace received in the meetings, is great and weighty. For example, a person can be touched by the gospel and receive salvation when he thinks of God or reads a spiritual book or a portion of the Bible on his own. However, his salvation will not be as strong as it could be if he is in a meeting. Those who are saved in a personal way may not have a salvation experience that is thorough or strong. When a person experiences salvation in a meeting, however, his salvation will be strong and thorough.</p>
<p>The light we receive when we read the Bible by ourselves can be small and limited. But when we read the Bible with others, the light we receive can be great and unlimited. Similarly, although we can touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence in our personal prayer, it is often limited. But there is an aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s presence in the meetings that exceeds an individual experience. Even in our prayer, we are often limited to trivial matters when we pray by ourselves. Our prayer for crucial matters is often ineffective. This is like moving boxes of different weights. We may be able to move a box that weighs twenty pounds, but it is impossible for us to move a box that weighs twenty thousand pounds by ourselves. If we attempt to move such a large box, it will be impossible. If we attempt to move it, it will still be in the same place even after twenty years of effort. In order to move it, we must gather others and move the box together. This is a principle in prayer. There are many things we cannot move by ourselves that must be brought to the meeting.</p>
<p>There are some spiritual matters for which the personal aspect of grace is insufficient; hence, they must be brought to the meeting. Some people constantly try to overcome a weakness or shortcoming by themselves. They pray repeatedly, but no matter how much they pray, they are unable to overcome. If they would be willing to bring that weakness to the meeting and ask others to pray with them, they will easily overcome it. Likewise, there are matters that cannot be understood through individual seeking, but they can be easily understood if we are willing to seek with other brothers and sisters. This shows the importance of meeting.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this in the Bible. When the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples on the evening of His resurrection, they rejoiced to see Him. However, since Thomas was not with them, he missed the Lord&rsquo;s appearing (John 20:19, 24-25). Mary Magdalene&rsquo;s experience of the Lord&rsquo;s appearing was fresh on the morning of His resurrection (vv. 1, 14-18). However, the weight and richness of that appearance cannot be compared to the Lord&rsquo;s appearance in the meeting. When the Lord appeared to His disciples, He breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). The Lord also charged them, saying, &ldquo;Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you retain, they are retained&rdquo; (v. 23). Such an appearing in which the disciples received the Holy Spirit and were commissioned was not experienced individually. It was experienced in the meeting.</p>
<p>Concerning the two aspects of grace that God gives to man, although the personal aspect is fresh and sweet, it is far less important than the corporate aspect. Thomas missed a great blessing because he was absent from the meeting that evening. However, he was present when the Lord appeared again in the evening of the following Lord&rsquo;s Day, and it was then that he obtained the blessing he had missed (vv. 26-29). If he had been absent from the second evening, he would have suffered a loss that could never have been regained.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out when the disciples were gathered together; He was not poured out while the disciples were having their personal prayer time (Acts 2:1-4). These examples show that if we want the Lord&rsquo;s presence, the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s outpouring, and the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, we must meet together. Understanding the Bible, answers to prayers, understanding God&rsquo;s will, deliverance from sins, and the solving of problems are often matters that cannot be solved individually. But once a person goes to the meeting, there is a way. Therefore, Christians can never be without meetings.</p>
<p>I repeat, there are two aspects to the grace that God gives to man: the personal and the corporate aspect. Grace in the personal aspect can be obtained in private, but grace in the corporate aspect can be obtained only in the meetings. Therefore, a normal Christian should not neglect his personal contact with God, nor should he neglect coming to the meetings to worship God with the saints. To neglect either aspect will cause us to suffer loss. Moreover, the loss suffered by neglecting the corporate aspect is greater than the loss suffered by neglecting the personal aspect. Rarely can Christians who only have a personal aspect and not a corporate aspect continue to stand firm before the Lord. It seems that those who are somewhat loose on the personal side but who continue to meet can still be sustained before the Lord. This shows that the corporate grace is greater, weightier, and more important than the personal grace. Hence, we must meet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEETING LIFE</h2>
<p>Christians should not only meet often but should also meet to the extent that meetings become a habit, and thus, a meeting life is produced. We need to see that meeting is not an occasional act of Christians; rather, it is the Christian life, just as eating and washing daily are part of the human life. Every morning we need to wash ourselves when we rise. Then at noon, we need to wash our hands again. We need to wash our hands several times a day. Furthermore, we need to eat three meals a day and drink water many times. These are not occasional acts; rather, they constitute our living. The meeting of Christians is the same; it is a living, not an occasional act.</p>
<p>If Christians do not meet, it means that they do not live. If man does not eat, he cannot live. He will starve to death. Likewise, if Christians do not meet, it is the same as committing suicide. They are killing the Christian life.</p>
<p>It seems as if the believers at the time of Pentecost did nothing but meet. They met from morning until night. Many people ask us why we meet every day of the week, meeting in the mornings and also in the evenings. Frankly speaking, however, we do not meet as often as the believers at the time of Pentecost. Meeting is the Christian life. As soon as Christians stop meeting, they stop living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ABANDONING OUR ASSEMBLING TOGETHER</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:25 says, &ldquo;Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is.&rdquo; Abandoning the assembling together will eventually become a habit as well. A Christian who develops a habit of not meeting is in a dangerous state and will certainly be unable to stand firm.</p>
<p>Concerning our meeting together, these five points should be adequate for this lesson. In the following lessons, we will consider how to meet and the different kinds of meetings.</p>
