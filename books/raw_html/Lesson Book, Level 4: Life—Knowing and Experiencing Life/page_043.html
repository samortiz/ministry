<h2 class=head1>VII. THE MANIFESTATIONS OF BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>What are the manifestations of being filled with the Holy Spirit? Or, how do we know that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit? [Since the Holy Spirit in us is the Spirit of life, and since our being filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit is for the maturity in life, the manifestation of being filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit must be an abundant, overflowing expression of life, flowing as rivers of living water out of our inner being] (John 7:38-39). Galatians 5:22-23 tells us that we also have love, joy, peace, etc., as our various inward conditions and virtues. According to Acts 4:31 we have boldness, power, and authority to speak the word of God in preaching the gospel and to prophesy in the meetings. The Bible mentions more than twenty items of the manifestations of being filled with the Holy Spirit.<p>Do you have some of these manifestations? We must exercise our spirit by confessing, turning our heart to Him, consecrating ourselves to Him, believing that we can be filled, speaking the word of God with boldness, and staying in the spirit by calling on His name and praying without ceasing. Because without the filling of the Spirit, all that we learn become mere doctrines, and all the dealings in the next few lessons will become religious rituals or asceticism. But with the filling of the Spirit, all that the Bible has revealed to us will become ours to enjoy today. All the dealings will result in more filling of the Spirit and experiences of life resulting in the growth of life. Dear brothers and sisters, it is easy to be filled, and we must practice to be filled every day, all the day, until we are raptured by Him. Hallelujah! What a Christian life!<h2 class=head2>Questions</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Why must we be filled with the Spirit?</li><li>What are the two aspects of the Spirit?</li><li>How are we benefitted by being filled with the Spirit essentially?</li><li>How can you experience the outward filling of the Spirit?</li><li>Share an experience of the outward filling of the Spirit.</li><li>Make a list of verses for each aspect of the Spiritâ€™s filling.</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Words of Training for the New Way, pp. 85-86.</li><li>Life Lessons, pp. 133, 142.</li></ol>
