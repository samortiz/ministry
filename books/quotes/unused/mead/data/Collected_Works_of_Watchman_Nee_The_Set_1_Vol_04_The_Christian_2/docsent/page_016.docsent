   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When the apostle addressed himself as "I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus," was not his intention for us to be partakers in all these three things?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Unless we do partake in them, we will probably not be able to understand the spiritual meaning in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we befriend the world, how can we sympathize with John on the island of Patmos?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since we are brothers together, we should suffer together, hope for glory together, and endure in waiting together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many of our brothers are still fighting fierce warfare in the battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can we retreat to enjoy comfort alone?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Num 32:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To have present gain is to suffer future loss.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, the present suffering is a future gain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where there is suffering, there is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Where there is no suffering, there is no glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more suffering there is, the more glory there is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The less suffering there is, the less glory there is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is willing to glorify us, but are we willing to receive His glory?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Are we willing to take the proper course of suffering to enter the kingdom of glory?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Can it be that Christ alone bore the cross and we are left in ease?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Can it be that my brothers bear the cross and I go completely unaffected?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should make a distinction here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eternal life is obtained by faith; it is free.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"He who believes into the Son has eternal life" John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For us, eternal life is assured.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have believed in the merit of the cross of the Lord Jesus and have received Him as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to His Word, God has given us eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, we can never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our salvation is fully assured, for the precious blood of the Lord is strong to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, what about the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"The kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and violent men seize it" Matt 11:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is very different from the qualification for eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not free faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is the need for work on the side of the receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, this is not the dead work of the old self under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it is the righteous work of the new man under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem of our eternal life is solved, but the question of the kingdom depends fully on the way we employ the Lord's grace, how we behave as saints, and how we suffer for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should praise the Lord because we have eternal life already, but we must still go on to receive His promised kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not think that there is any place for our self-work here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All these works are the result of our drawing our supply from the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"I...was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus" Rev 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word of God and the testimony of Jesus here refer to the testimony of John.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because he was faithful to God's truth, he was exiled to the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He believed in another king, the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He looked for another kingdom, the kingdom of the heavens, which is far better than the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That was the reason he was put into his present state.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The island of Patmos was a very deserted place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To the east were the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Beyond that was Babylon, the great river Euphrates, and Mesopotamia.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To the west were Greece and Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To the north was Gog.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To the south was Palestine and Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This island was in the middle of a vast ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Jagged rocks surrounded the whole island.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There was no arable land at all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There was no river, no trees.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was a desolate scene.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Other than the sound of the wind and the water, there was no sign of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because John was faithful to the word of God, he was sent to such a place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we would not go along with the world and would fight the good fight for the truth, we will also have to go to the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the reward in this life for the faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The world has not improved from the time of John until now.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the contrary, it has turned worse day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we are strict and unyielding as John was for the testimony of the Lord Jesus and His salvation, how can we expect lesser persecutions than the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I am afraid that the persecution will be more severe!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, Satan tempts many to skillfully avoid sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some have been spared through compromising with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Others have been protected through seeking refuge in rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We know that the Lord can protect us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many times the Lord will not allow us to go through sufferings, but how different is the peace that is obtained through compromise and trust in the world from that given by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although we are not now at the stage where we crave after suffering, at least we should not lower our standard because of the persecutions and try to please men as a result of this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At any rate, one thing is sure: the minute we disassociate ourselves from the sins and organization of the world, our life in Patmos begins.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Still, praise and thank the Lord, for "who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rom 8:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thank and praise the Lord, for "in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us" Rom 8:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The phrase "on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus" may mean that God had again entrusted to John the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To those who have, there shall be added more.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is no one who has the experience of Patmos who does not have the revelation of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Did not the Joseph in the prison, the Moses in the wilderness, the David in suffering, and the Paul in chains all have fresh revelations?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>John was following in their footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although the Word of God is now complete and there is no need for newer revelations, do not those who follow in the footsteps of the servants of God receive the opening up of God's word and the companionship of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the reward of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The reward of suffering is the unveiling of the loving face of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Those that seek after worldly comfort, blessing, and glory may not have the suffering of Patmos, but neither will they have the revelation of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A fleshly person considers the Lord's cross as a fearsome pathway, but those who love the Lord take the cross and their glory.</S>
