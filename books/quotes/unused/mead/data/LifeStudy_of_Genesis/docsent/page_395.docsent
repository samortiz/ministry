   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Third Aspect</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Experience of Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph are a complete unit in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not consider them as four separate individuals, but as four different aspects of one's complete experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we come to the third aspect the aspect of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Abraham, we have God's calling, justification by faith, living by faith in God, and living in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Isaac, we have the inheriting of grace and the resting and enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Isaac we do not see justification by faith, for that is covered in Abraham's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But with Isaac we have the inheriting and enjoying of grace, which we do not see in Abraham's record.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this we see the different aspects of the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Jacob, we see God's selection and God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although we all love to inherit and enjoy grace, we do not like the dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Jacob, we do not see the aspect of enjoyment; rather, we see the aspect of God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because Jacob supplanted so much, God's hand was always upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jacob's supplanting brought in God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God might have said, "Jacob, you are able to supplant, but I am able to deal with you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In every step of your supplanting, My dealings will come in."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was not God's punishment; it was God's dealings for the purpose of Jacob's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As I was considering this message in the presence of the Lord, I laughed when I noticed that Jacob began to fight even before he was born.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rebekah had conceived and "the children struggled together within her" 25:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This fighting was probably started by Jacob, not by Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Esau's fighting must have been defensive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jacob might have said, "Esau, you shouldn't go ahead of me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I must be first."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then Esau might have said, "No, I'm in front of you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I must get out first."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The two children were fighting, and the mother, being unable to tolerate it, inquired of the Lord concerning it 25:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Under the sovereignty of God, Esau came out first, but Jacob did not stop striving.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After he came out, he still took hold of Esau's heel 25:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of this, he was given the name of Jacob, which means heel-holder.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since Jacob was such a heel-holder, God had to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The issue of God's dealing was transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At a mature age, Jacob was no longer Jacob he was Israel, a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, God put the whole world, including Pharaoh, under him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I say again that these four persons constitute a complete unit of the experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are all Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At present, we are still under the process of God's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But one day we shall all become Israels, the princes of God, ruling with our "Joseph" over all the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>a. Being Chosen</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Jacob, we see God's selection, the matter of Jacob's being chosen 25:21-26; 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you believe that you have been chosen?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How do you know this?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although we may stand on the Word of God and say, "I know that I have been chosen because the Bible tells me so," I would still ask this question: how do we know from our experience that we have been chosen by God?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We know it by the fact that we cannot get away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>During the past fifty years of my Christian life, I have tried many times to get away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have even said to Him, "Lord, I am tired of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am running away."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although I tried to run away, I could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>While some Christian workers are afraid of your staying away from the Lord, I have the boldness to encourage you to stay away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Try your best to do it, telling Him, "Lord, I don't love You anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I'm through with being a Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may say this to the Lord, but He will reply, "Are you through with Me?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It's not up to you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You may be through, but I am not.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where shall you go to Egypt?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you go there, I'll go there to wait for you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you get there, you will find that I'm already there."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all have been trapped, and there is no escape.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is strong proof that we have been chosen by God.</S>
