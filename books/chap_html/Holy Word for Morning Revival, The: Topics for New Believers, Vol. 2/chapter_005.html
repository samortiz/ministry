<p><strong>WEEK 12 &mdash; DAY 1</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Eph. 3:9 And to enlighten all <em>that they may see</em> what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 Cor. 15:45 ...The last Adam <em>became</em> a life-giving Spirit.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head2">The Church</h2>
<p>Today is the dispensation, the age, of the church. The next age is the age of the kingdom of a thousand years. The church is for now; the church is for today. God&rsquo;s goal is to have a church today, a church in this dispensation, a church on this earth. Many dear saints throughout the centuries received light on many things in the Bible, but they missed the mark of God&rsquo;s divine economy and the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. The Lord desires to fulfill His purpose and to make His goal so clear to all His loving seekers.<sup>167</sup></p>
<p>If you would be a proper Christian, you need to see not only the vision of Christ but also the vision of the church. You need to see that God&rsquo;s desire is to have the church.... All that God does is for the church, and every kind of work and ministry should be for the church....All other things are secondary. The primary thing is that the church is God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire.<sup>168</sup></p>
<p>[In this portion we shall cover the hidden mystery in God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;the church, the formation of the church, the two aspects of the church, the intrinsic essence and significance of the church, the building of the church, and twelve descriptions of the church.]</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Hidden Mystery in God&rsquo;s Eternal Economy</h2>
<p>What is a mystery? We may say that a mystery is a mysterious story. A mystery, a mysterious story, was hidden in the eternal God and in His eternal <em>oikonomia</em> [<em>economy;</em> see Introduction, pp. 139-141].<sup>169</sup> Ephesians 3:9 talks about...the economy of the mystery, &ldquo;which throughout the ages has been hidden in God.&rdquo;...This mystery was hidden in God throughout the ages (that is, from eternity) and through all past ages, but now it has been brought to light to the New Testament believers....God opened up His heart to show the apostles His hidden mystery, especially to the apostle Paul.<sup>170</sup> This mystery, this mysterious story, is the church.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal economy...is an eternal plan; it is also a purpose....According to Ephesians 3:11, God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is the &ldquo;purpose of the ages&rdquo; [lit.]. The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past....[Moreover,] God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is of His will....At this point we need to ask what God&rsquo;s will is....God&rsquo;s will is what God wants.... What does God want? God wants the church. God wants us for the church. [In addition,] we need to see that God&rsquo;s will is according to God&rsquo;s good pleasure (1:9). God&rsquo;s good pleasure is His heart pleasure, which we may call the desire of His heart....God&rsquo;s purpose, God&rsquo;s will, and God&rsquo;s good pleasure are interrelated....First, God had a pleasure, a desire. Then He determined [purposed] to carry out this desire, and this became God&rsquo;s will, what God wants....Furthermore, all this is a mystery, a hidden, mysterious story. This indicates that the church is...God&rsquo;s desire, God&rsquo;s good pleasure, [and the mystery in God&rsquo;s economy].<sup>171</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Formation of the Church</h2>
<p>We need to realize that none of us is qualified to form the church. Only the Lord Jesus is qualified for this. In Matthew 16:18 He says, &ldquo;I will build My church.&rdquo; He is the unique One who is qualified to form the church.</p>
<p>In order for Christ to form the church it was necessary for Him to pass through death and enter into resurrection.<sup>172</sup> [Before]...the Lord Jesus...passed through death for man&rsquo;s sin and...entered into resurrection...He was still in the flesh and could not enter into people to be their life. But in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit [1 Cor. 15:45], and now He can come into the believers to impart life to them.<sup>173</sup></p>
