   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING PEOPLE UP IN THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When you help people to read the footnotes and the Life-study messages, you must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not give others the impression that you are a leader or a core member.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must learn this one thing: never assume the position of a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must be very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When no one has anything to say, you start by speaking something in order to help everyone to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who are there for the first time will not be accustomed to this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason you must bring them slowly into this kind of exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A home meeting of eight to ten people is very easy to help in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must practice this regularly over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do this once a week, fifty-two weeks a year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that if you brothers are faithful and patient to practice this steadily for a year, surely many people will be built up by the end of that year.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We only need to try it for a year.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many results will be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once people are built up, they will be very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anyone will then be able to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They can speak for the Lord at home, to their neighbors, friends, and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The effect will be far reaching.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You all know of the American soft drink company Coca-Cola.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Apparently, they are selling a drink to people and earning a very small amount of money per drink.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when you add the small amounts together, it is a lot of money.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we all speak the Lord s word today, this will have a great impact.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In September, Taipei had a gospel week.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There were no big gospel meetings, but for one week the brothers and sisters went out to contact people one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You brought 1,104 people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the best proof.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not underestimate the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What we are after is the widespreading.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If everyone would rise up to speak the Lord s word, the gospel will spread out quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>USING THE LORD S WORD IN THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If three gospel friends come to your home meeting, you cannot ignore them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You can still use the verses from Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when you use them, you must use them in the way of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You need to learn to say, The Bible says, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We human beings are all fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are born in the flesh, and the flesh is fallen....</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your speaking can go from the flesh to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a very good gospel message.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may say, When we live in ourselves, we cannot escape corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have no way to overcome the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when we believe in the Lord Jesus and we call on His name, His Spirit comes into ours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He produces fruits of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you speak this way, people will certainly be able to understand, and they will certainly admire the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To preach the gospel in this way will also nourish the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope that you brothers and sisters would also learn to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For the long run we all need to exercise to sing the hymns together in a harmonious way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe the dormant saints will be recovered and the newly saved ones will be added.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to do our best to attach ourselves to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The foundation for the building of the church is the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all need to change our concept and habit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From now on, we will not have any more hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All are members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Each one must function actively.</S>
