<H2 CLASS=HEAD6>b) God Appearing to Jacob</H2><P>After the altar was built, God appeared to Jacob again (v. 9). Jacob's experience was somewhat different from Abraham's. When God first appeared to Abraham, there was no altar. But God appeared to Jacob, not only at Bethel, but in front of the altar. Before we came into the church life, we did have some experience of God's appearing. However, we were not at Bethel in front of the altar. Being by the altar at Bethel makes a great difference. Now, after coming into the church and building an altar, God appears again. Many of us can testify that after coming into the church life and consecrating ourselves to the Lord anew, we had the deep conviction that the Lord had appeared to us. We had the appearing of the Lord in our personal experience. It was not a mere doctrine. As long as we have built an altar at Bethel, we should have the appearing of God. This should not happen once in a while; it must be a continual experience. Daily and even hourly, we should experience the appearing of the Lord. In other words, we should walk in the Lord's presence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>c) God Blessing Jacob</H2><P>When God appeared to Jacob in Bethel, He blessed him (v. 9). What blessing we have received since coming to Bethel and building an altar! When I was young, I liked the hymn that says, "Count your blessings, name them one by one." I encourage you to count your blessings, making a list of all the blessings you have experienced in the church life. How profound are the blessings in the church! Outside the church, no one can have the blessings found in Bethel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>d) God Reminding Jacob of His New Name</H2><P>In His appearing to Jacob at Bethel, God also reminded him of his new name, saying, "Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called his name Israel" (v. 10). God seemed to be saying, "Jacob, didn't I change your name? Why then do you still call yourself Jacob? Now I remind you that your name is no longer Jacob and that you must call yourself Israel. Don't call yourself Jacob anymore, for that means that you live, walk, behave, and have your being in a 'Jacobean' way. You must live, walk, and have your being like Israel. Don't you know that you have wrestled with Me and have overcome Me? You must show the universe that you are an overcomer. You are not only a prince of God, but a wrestler of God. You must live in this way." This reminder had a background: the trouble caused by Jacob's sons and Jacob's fear and loss of boldness. Although he had been bold to wrestle with God, he was timid in facing the city people. In fact, he was terrified of them. But in reminding him of his new name, Israel, God seemed to say, "You don't need to be afraid of them. If you are afraid, it means that you have forgotten the name I gave you. I have given you the name 'the wrestler of God.' If you can wrestle with God, then you certainly can wrestle with anyone. If you can overcome Me, then whom can't you overcome? Jacob, you don't need to be afraid of anyone. I have given you the name Israel. I was not offended by your wrestling with Me; rather, I appreciated it. Thus, I have given you the name 'the wrestler of God.' From now on, you should not be a supplanter, but a wrestler of God. Wherever you go, you must proclaim, 'I am the wrestler of God! The wrestler of God comes!' Jacob, behave yourself like a wrestler of God. Why must you be so timid? After you took My word to come here to Bethel, all the city people were terrified of you. You don't need to be afraid of them. Why should you be Jacob anymore? Forget about being Jacob and call yourself Israel."</P><P>The name Jacob means supplanter, heel-holder. Which do you want to be&#151;a supplanter or a wrestler of God? Our original name was Jacob, but now our name is Israel. Do you believe this? If you do, then why are you still afraid of your temper? Why do you not rise up and say, "Temper, you must know that I am a wrestler of God. I am Israel." Whatever you fear will become your portion. If you are afraid of losing your temper, be assured that you will lose it. But if you tell your temper that you are Israel, the wrestler of God, the little "bug" of temper will disappear. Some of you may say, "I don't feel that I am Israel." No one asked you to feel it. God did not say to Jacob, "Jacob, don't you feel that you are Israel?" If God had done this, Jacob certainly would have replied, "No, I never feel like I am Israel. According to my feeling, I am still Jacob." Take heed to God's word. Which is more trustworthy&#151;your feeling or God's word? Forget your feelings, considerations, understanding, and natural sight and listen to God's word and to His reminder. God has already said that our name should be called Israel. Why then are you still Jacob? From now on, we all must be Israel. Here in Bethel, Jacob began to call himself Israel. Would you say that you are Israel? Do you have the boldness to proclaim this, or do you still say that you are so weak? We are at Bethel and we are Israel. Both Bethel and Israel end with the letters e-l, indicating that both names imply the name of God. Do not look at yourself; listen to His reminder. This should encourage us and prepare us for God's promise.</P>
