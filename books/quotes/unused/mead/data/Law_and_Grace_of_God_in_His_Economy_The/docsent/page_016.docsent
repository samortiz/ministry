   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The everyday experience of the believers must be grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If it is not grace, it is not the believers experience; if it is not grace, it is not the Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Christian living must be the living of grace, the experience of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the preceding message we saw that grace is God s embodiment Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the grace experienced by the believers is Christ, the embodiment of God.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The grace in God s economy in the believers experience is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without being processed, the Triune God could not become grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is one, yet He is three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father, and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, and as the Spirit the Son is revealed and realized.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This Triune God dispenses Himself into us to be our portion as grace to us that we may enjoy Him as our everything in His Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. God, Who Was in the Beginning,</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God, who was in the beginning, became flesh in time as grace for man to receive, possess, and enjoy John 1:1, 14, 16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first step, which is also the greatest step, of the process which the Triune God passed through was incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God, who was in the beginning, became flesh in time; that was His tabernacling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His coming among men in this way was full of grace, and of His fullness we have all received.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He came that we might receive grace, even grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When He came, grace also came.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law was given to us, but grace came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The law could not come by itself; hence, it was given to us, but grace came with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, grace is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Jesus came, grace came.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a One is grace for us to receive, enjoy, and experience as our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the real salvation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is amazing that one day the eternal God, the Creator of all things, was conceived in the womb of the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only so, but He stayed in the virgin s womb for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The eternal God, the infinite God, the Creator of all things, entered into the womb of a little virgin and stayed there for nine months!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In His creation, God ordained that there be nine months for a human pregnancy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God did not violate this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the fullness of nine months, He came out of the mother s womb and became a child.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Father as the source is embodied and expressed in the Son John 14:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God the Father is hidden, and God the Son is manifested among men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The little child lying in the manger was the eternal God, the infinite Lord, and the Lord who created the heavens, the earth, and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The incarnated God has been united and mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is both the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He remained in humanity and was mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This God-man passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the first thirty years He lived in a poor carpenter s home and learned from Joseph to be a carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He tasted and passed through all the hardships and pains of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not forget that this One who was a carpenter is the Creator of all things mingled with humanity as a small man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the fullness of thirty years He began to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He came out of Nazareth of Galilee, a despised place.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He had no attracting form or majesty that people would desire Him, but His words were with power, and His doings were with great might.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He caused the blind to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, and the dead to be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The words He spoke had never been spoken by anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said, I am the way and the reality and the life John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He also said, I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly 10:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These words are easy to understand, yet they are very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Neither Confucius nor Socrates spoke these words; they could not think of such words.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The words of the so-called philosophers cannot be compared to the words of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord Jesus did many things and spoke many words on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eventually, He was betrayed, arrested, and crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was crucified from 9:00 A.M. until 3:00 P.M., suffering on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>During the first three hours He was persecuted by men for doing God s will; in the last three hours He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>During this time God counted Him as our substitute, who took the place of sinners, bearing our sins and being made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hence, God forsook Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>About 3:00 P.M. Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? Matt 27:46 . When He yielded up His spirit, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They came out of the tombs after Jesus resurrection and appeared to many.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All these phenomena proved that His death was not an ordinary death.</S>

   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the day after the Sabbath, which was the first day of the week, while it was still dark, some sisters went to Jesus tomb and were weeping there.</S>
