We are nothing, but You are all. We can gather here because You are not only all but also all-inclusive. Lord, we look to You from the depths of our being that You would visit us with Yourself and with Your riches in these three days of fellowship. O Lord, pour down Your Spirit, even Yourself, to fill us outwardly and inwardly. May there be no time wasted in these three days, but may every minute be under Your enriching. Cleanse us, Lord; we need Your cleansing. Thank You for constantly cleansing us with Your precious blood. O Lord, we also need Your forgiveness; do forgive us. Open Yourself and the heavens to us and speak a word which we need, a word which we lack. Lord, give us utterance; deliver us from our own natural way of speaking. Lord, put Your words in us and speak Your own words out of us. Bless every one of us. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>Thank the Lord that He has brought you brothers from some faraway places to be here. You probably have many things within you that you would like to say and many matters that you would like to fellowship about. In our time of fellowship I believe that what the Lord is going to speak to us will be able to meet all our needs and answer our questions even without our knowing it. I have also looked to the Lord concerning this fellowship, seeking particularly to know what He desires to speak to us. I am in fear and trembling, being afraid of wasting your time. Without the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, everything is in vain. Therefore, after my seeking before the Lord, I feel that this is a golden opportunity for us to focus on one matter&mdash;the center of the Bible. This matter is the highest vision in the Bible; it is the vision that governs and controls us.</p><p>Paul said, &ldquo;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision&rdquo; (Acts 26:19). What was the heavenly vision to which Paul referred? It has been at least seventy-three years now since Brother Nee was raised up by the Lord to speak for Him among us. During this period of time, not only our hearts but even our hands have never left the Bible. According to the number of pages we have touched, it is as if we have thoroughly handled a hundred Bibles. Moreover, we have many notes of what we have gained from our study of the Word. After seventy-three years, we may say that the Lord&rsquo;s revelation among us has reached its peak with a consummation during the Chinese New Year&rsquo;s conference last year. This consummation can be seen in the new hymn that I wrote: &ldquo;What miracle! What mystery! / That God and man should blended be! / God became man to make man God, / Untraceable economy!&rdquo; The heavenly vision which the Lord showed Paul was this economy, the New Testament economy, the eternal economy of God. This economy is the revelation of the entire New Testament.</p><h2 class="head1">THE &ldquo;ROOTS AND TRUNK&rdquo; OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>Everything in the universe involves two aspects: the &ldquo;roots and trunk&rdquo; and the &ldquo;branches.&rdquo; A tree has roots and a trunk, and it also has branches. We may trim the branches of the tree, but we must not touch its roots and trunk. The Bible, in particular the New Testament, is just like this: it has its roots and trunk and it also has its branches. The less knowledgeable and experienced a person is, the less he can see the roots and the trunk; all he can see are the branches. Let us use a flower for an illustration. It is very easy to see the blossoming of a flower and smell its fragrance, but we rarely consider its source, its origin. Only those with a pursuing heart pay very little attention to the outward blossoming of the flower and the spreading forth of its fragrance; instead, they study its source, its origin. Likewise, in our study of the Word, instead of paying attention to the branches, we should go deeply into the roots and the trunk.</p><p>Since the day I was saved, the Lord planted in me a fervent love for the Bible. Of course, in the beginning I only saw the branches, the trivial things in the Bible. As a rule, even the trivial things are joined to the principal matters. When we touch the trivial things, however, we often detach them from the principal matters. Let us consider baptism as an example. Whether baptism is a subsidiary issue or a main issue depends on how you view it and what you say about it. Today in general, when people bring up the matter of baptism, all they care about are trivial things, such as whether to use hot water or cold water. Furthermore, they argue much concerning these trivial things, and the more they argue, the further they are from the fundamental matters. In fact, baptism is fundamentally related to the economy of God. Unless you speak of baptism in relation to the economy of God, what you speak concerning baptism is something trivial. If you relate it to the economy of God, baptism is something fundamental. Fundamentally, according to what Paul said, to be baptized is to enter into the death of Christ and be buried with Him and thereby identified with Him in His death and resurrection (Rom. 6:4). If you have this view, you are joined to the economy of God and have entered into the &ldquo;roots and trunk.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE ENTIRE BIBLE BEING CONCERNED WITH<br />THE ECONOMY OF GOD</h2><p>The Bible has two big sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament includes types and prophecies, both of which are concerned with God&rsquo;s economy. The types are portraits of God&rsquo;s economy; the prophecies refer to the economy of God to come, that is, the New Testament economy. None of the types of the Old Testament can be separated from God&rsquo;s economy; it is even more so with the prophecies. The New Testament is the fulfillment of all the types and prophecies of the Old Testament. In the New Testament the economy of God is fulfilled and accomplished. Every book, every chapter, and every verse of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, from Matthew to Revelation, are concerned with God&rsquo;s economy. This is the New Testament revelation which is also called the teaching of the apostles (Acts 2:42). Here <em>apostles</em> does not refer to all the apostles; it refers particularly to the few writers of the New Testament whose writings constitute the teaching of the apostles.</p><p>The teaching of the apostles that we speak of today is not our own teaching; it is the entire New Testament written by the apostles. The main components of the New Testament are the writings of John, Paul, and Peter; besides these, there are the writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke, James, and Jude. Matthew was one of the twelve apostles. The Gospel of Mark may also be called &ldquo;the Gospel of Peter,&rdquo; because Mark received his learning from Peter (cf. 1 Pet. 5:13). What he wrote originated from and belonged to Peter. Luke, who was an attendant physician to Paul (cf. Col. 4:14), wrote the Gospel of Luke based upon what he saw through Paul; hence, the Gospel of Luke may also be called &ldquo;the Gospel of Paul.&rdquo; Luke also wrote the Acts. Luke&rsquo;s writings may be considered as belonging to Paul. Paul wrote all the fourteen Epistles from Romans to Hebrews. After Hebrews, we have the Epistle of James. Due to the lack of a clear view concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, James put undue emphasis on individual, practical Christian perfection. What he wrote may be considered a contrasting background. The Epistles of Peter follow the Epistle of James, and the Epistles of John follow the Epistles of Peter. After this, we have the Epistle of Jude with only one chapter, and its content is very close to what Peter wrote. Jude is followed by Revelation, which was written by John and is the last book of the New Testament. In reality, the teaching of the apostles mainly consists of the writings of John, Paul, and Peter. The teaching of the apostles is concluded in Revelation. Hence, at the end of Revelation, John says that nothing can be added to the book, nor can anything be taken away from the book (22:18-19). Nothing should be added or subtracted. The New Testament revelation is thus concluded. This is the revelation of the New Testament; this is also the teaching of the apostles.</p><p>The New Testament revelation, the teaching of the apostles, is concerned with God&rsquo;s economy. According to 1 Timothy 1:3-4, we may say that God&rsquo;s economy is the general term for God&rsquo;s New Testament revelation. Paul said that he left Timothy in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach different things. According to the context, different teachings refer to teachings that are not in line with the economy of God. What certain ones taught, though somewhat based on the New Testament revelation, were genealogies and the law. These were different from God&rsquo;s economy in faith. They should not have taught things outside of God&rsquo;s economy. This shows us that God&rsquo;s economy is the New Testament revelation, the teaching of the apostles. It is uniquely one, perfect, and complete. Nothing can be added to it or taken away from it. Today in the church we should teach only according to the New Testament revelation, which is the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Anything less than this is inadequate, and anything more than this is man&rsquo;s teaching, not the words of God&rsquo;s economy.</p><p>I repeat: The Old Testament speaks with types and prophecies of the things to come in the New Testament. The New Testament is a revelation composed of the speaking of the apostles. Among the apostles, John spoke a great deal, and what he spoke can be considered the beginning and the conclusion; Paul spoke even more, and his speaking may be considered the center and the framework; Peter also spoke, adding something as a supplement. This is the New Testament revelation, unveiled by the teaching of the apostles and composed of words concerning the economy of God. Anything we speak today&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;should come out of the apostles&rsquo; teaching and concern God&rsquo;s economy. Beginning with Brother Nee to this day, we have thoroughly covered the economy of God in its entirety and in completeness. We have studied every verse and touched every item from Matthew 1:1 to Revelation 22:21. Thank God that, under His sovereign grace, all these things have been printed.</p><p>The words released through Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry were very rich, but according to my knowledge, many of the notes of his speaking were not printed in books. For this reason, I have a deep regret. When I was with him in mainland China, we had a great deal of fellowship, and all of it was concerning the revelation in the holy Word. Therefore, I am very clear about Brother Nee&rsquo;s knowledge of the Bible. At that time, he used the term &ldquo;plan&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;economy.&rdquo; He clearly pointed out to me the eternal plan, the eternal economy, of God in the Bible.</p><p>Brother Nee indeed had a unique view of the Bible. I thank the Lord for putting me at his side for eighteen years that I might learn much from him. Every time I heard his speaking, the light came and my understanding was opened. For example, at the end of 1933, the beginning of my entry into the Lord&rsquo;s work, Brother Nee prepared to have a conference in January of the next year on Christ as the centrality and universality of God, that is, concerning Christ being all and in all, the all-inclusive One. One afternoon when I went to his home, he asked me where I was in my reading of the Word. I told him that I was in Acts and Colossians. He said, &ldquo;Very good. These two books are related.&rdquo; This word puzzled me because I could not see how these two books were related. Brother Nee explained to me that Acts shows us how Jesus ascended to heaven and was made Christ by God (2:36). Yet only a sketch of this Christ is given in Acts; the details are explained by Paul. Among the fourteen Epistles of Paul, only a short book, the book of Colossians, is occupied specifically with Christ&rsquo;s fullness, riches, and all-inclusiveness. Hence, Colossians is connected to Acts. Brother Nee&rsquo;s word on that day really opened my eyes. Today Christians may know that Acts 2 refers to the death and resurrection of Jesus and His being made Christ by God, but they lack the understanding of the all-inclusiveness of Christ unveiled in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.</p><p>All these precious revelations in the Word were given to us by God, but regretfully, they were not printed in books at Brother Nee&rsquo;s time. Consequently, in 1974 I began to have the burden to study the entire Bible in the way of a life-study. We began simultaneously to cover the New Testament in the two big annual trainings and the Old Testament during the week. I truly worship the Lord that presently we have only three books left to cover: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. Actually, Brother Nee already covered Song of Songs with a detailed exposition. Furthermore, in 1972 in the United States, I covered life and building in Song of Songs. However, I have not touched Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. In the summer training this year, we will discover that these two books are absolutely different from our natural understanding. Thank the Lord, we now have a complete set of life-studies, from Genesis to Revelation, with a penetrating explanation of God&rsquo;s economy.</p><p>Last year the Lord led us to begin the crystallization-study of the Bible, a study which goes even deeper than the life-study of the Bible. Recently, I have been on the crystallization-study of Romans every Wednesday night. The life-study opens the entire Bible to us in a general way, but we still need to touch the depths, the crystals, of the holy Scriptures. Although we are acquainted with the book of Romans and I have expounded it several times, there are still many hidden things as the intrinsic essence of the divine revelation. By such a crystallization-study, the Lord can reveal to us the intrinsic essence of the divine revelation, item by item.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ECONOMY OF GOD<br />REVEALED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>Now we would like to see the economy of God revealed in the New Testament. The first chapter of the New Testament shows God&rsquo;s incarnation, God becoming a man, and the last chapter shows the New Jerusalem. From God&rsquo;s incarnation to the New Jerusalem is the New Testament as well as the economy of God.</p><h2 class="head2">The First Section of God&rsquo;s Economy</h2><p>The economy of God is of two sections: The first section begins with God becoming flesh, and the second section begins with this flesh, the last Adam, becoming the life-giving Spirit. The first section is God becoming flesh, and the second section is the flesh becoming the Spirit. Both sections were accomplished in Christ. It took thirty-three and a half years to accomplish the section of God becoming flesh, which includes Christ&rsquo;s work and ministry on the earth. This section of His work and ministry was completed in His resurrection. In His resurrection His flesh was transfigured into the Spirit. When He entered into resurrection, immediately He began a new stage of His ministry. He accomplished His ministry in the new stage not in the flesh but as the Spirit. The stage in His flesh was from His incarnation to His resurrection only, because in His resurrection His flesh was transfigured into the Spirit.</p><p>God became flesh and lived for thirty-three and a half years. Then He died on the cross and was buried in the tomb. This flesh was resurrected after dying and being buried in the tomb; this flesh did not remain in the earth. When the Lord was to be buried, two disciples of renown, Nicodemus and Joseph from Arimathea, came and took His body, bound it in linen cloths with the spices, and laid it in the tomb (John 19:38-42). After His resurrection, before He left the tomb, He arranged the linen cloths there in good order and folded up the handkerchief neatly. On the morning of His resurrection, when the disciples came to the tomb, they knew that He had not been stolen by someone or encountered some trouble, since the linen cloths with which He was wrapped were lying there in good order (20:5-7). What Nicodemus and Joseph from Arimathea did to Him was a great thing in proving that He had resurrected with a body.</p><p>A former co-worker personally told me that he did not believe that the Lord Jesus was still a man after His resurrection. He said that the Lord Jesus became a man and was a man only until His resurrection, that at His resurrection He put off the &ldquo;man&rdquo; which He had put on in His incarnation, and that today in heaven He is not man but God only. This is utterly wrong. The Lord Jesus Himself spoke clearly concerning this. When the high priest interrogated Him, asking Him whether or not He was the Son of God, He replied, &ldquo;You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power&rdquo; (Matt. 26:64). This indicates that the ascended Christ is still the Son of Man. After the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, Stephen saw the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God (Acts 7:56). On another occasion the Lord Jesus said that the Son of Man would come on the clouds of heaven (Matt. 24:30).</p><p>Hebrews 1 says that Christ in His second coming is the firstborn Son of God (v. 6). For a long time I wondered why this verse refers to Christ in His second coming as &ldquo;the Firstborn.&rdquo; Christ as the only begotten Son of God has only divinity but no human element; however, in His second coming Christ is the firstborn Son of God who possesses both divinity and humanity as a God-man and who still has a human body. How do we know that Christ still has a human body after His resurrection? Because on the morning of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection the disciples saw that His tomb was empty and His body was gone. Then in the evening of that day, while the doors were shut where the disciples were, Jesus suddenly came and stood in the midst and showed them His hands and His side (John 20:19-20). Therefore, after His resurrection He still definitely possessed a human body, but in resurrection that human body was transfigured into a spiritual body. Since it is spiritual, it is no longer fleshly; it is not a body of the fallen flesh but a body that is spiritual and glorious. Philippians 3:21 says that our body will be transfigured to be conformed to the body of His glory. Today He is still in His glorious body waiting for us, the believers, to be raptured and our bodies transfigured to be the same as His glorious body.</p><p>We see clearly that the economy of God is of two sections. The first section is God&rsquo;s incarnation, which includes four steps: incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection. It was in resurrection that He ended the stage of incarnation by His being transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. Today our Christ is the pneumatic Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Second Section of God&rsquo;s Economy</h2><p>Christ&rsquo;s transfiguration from the flesh into the Spirit began the second section of &rsquo;s economy. In His resurrection Christ was transfigured into the Spirit. Consequently, beginning from Acts, this Christ is no longer the Christ in the flesh but the pneumatic Christ; He is the very Spirit. Therefore, Romans 8:9-11 shows us that the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ, and the indwelling Spirit&mdash;all four&mdash;are one. The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Christ is the very Christ, and this Christ is the indwelling Spirit. Paul concludes his second Epistle to Timothy by saying, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit&rdquo; (4:22). If the Lord was only a fleshly body and not the Spirit, how could He be with Timothy&rsquo;s spirit? Because the Lord is the Spirit, He can be with our spirit. Hence, the second section of God&rsquo;s economy is carried out through Christ&rsquo;s becoming the Spirit.</p><p>The ministry of Christ consists of His earthly ministry and His heavenly ministry. He carried out the earthly ministry in His flesh for the accomplishment of redemption. Once He accomplished redemption He entered into the tomb for rest. Then in resurrection He became the Spirit and thus began His heavenly ministry. He became the Spirit in order to dispense God Himself into people. This dispensing is He Himself coming into us. This matter is initially dealt with in Acts but not in a clear way. In his fourteen Epistles Paul portrays this matter thoroughly, showing us that God became the Spirit to enter into us and dispense God into us. The issue of this dispensing is the church, which is the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the counterpart of Christ as His bride, the ultimate consummation of which is the New Jerusalem.</p><p>This is the economy of God, the New Testament revelation, the teaching of the apostles. This is the result of our study of the Word for over seventy years. This is the extract, the crystallization. The twenty-seven books of the New Testament mention many matters, but in summary they concern the economy of God. God&rsquo;s economy is that God became flesh, passed through human living, died, and resurrected; then He became the Spirit and entered into men to dispense God into them for their regeneration, issuing in the church. The church as the Body of Christ is His continuation, enlargement, and multiplication; it is also the kingdom of God, the house of God, and at the same time the counterpart of Christ as His bride. The ultimate consummation of the totality of all these items is the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO SEE THE VISION OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2><p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I have been an elder for fifteen years, but I still don&rsquo;t know how to be an elder. What shall I do?&rdquo; Let me tell you this: You do not know how to be an elder because you have not seen the economy of God. Once you see the economy of God, you will know how to be an elder, and all your troubles will be gone. Do not blame me; I am just like you. You have the flesh; I also have the flesh. You are weak; I am weaker. You have troubles; I have more troubles, and my troubles are more complicated. How can you be an elder? You have to see that God became flesh, passed through human living, died daily, eventually died on the cross, and then resurrected and became the Spirit. This Spirit enters into us to dispense God into us. If you see these things, you will know how to be an elder. If you pray over these words and let them get into you, you will spontaneously realize how to be an elder. Hence, this is a governing vision and a controlling vision. As the leading apostle, Paul was governed and controlled by this vision in all his work and actions. We should be governed and controlled also.</p><p>Perhaps others may ask, &ldquo;What is the Bible all about?&rdquo; Hu Shih, a renowned Chinese educator and philosopher, appraised the Chinese Union Version of the Bible as a great stride in the Chinese vernacular language. This shows that he also read the Bible, yet what he saw was the superior vernacular language. So, what is the Bible? How will you speak to others about the Bible? You need to learn to say that the Bible has two sections: The first section is the types and prophecies, and the second section is the fulfillment and accomplishment. All the things referred to in the Bible are for the fulfillment and accomplishment of the economy of God. The economy of God is that God became flesh, passed through human living, died, resurrected, and became the Spirit to enter into us as life and dispense God into us that we may be transformed for the producing of the church, which is the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the counterpart of Christ, the ultimate aggregate of which is the New Jerusalem. This is the Bible, and this is the vision that governs and controls us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="msg">THE CRYSTALLIZED SIGNIFICANCES<br />OF THE STEPS OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />AND OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><p>Prayer: O Lord, we need You. We need You to come as the Spirit to pour Yourself on us outwardly and fill us inwardly. Lord, without the Spirit we have no hope or deliverance; the One whom we look to is the Spirit. Thank You that You have been processed and consummated as this Spirit, who is Your very self. O Lord, open the eyes of our heart that we may see clearly.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CRYSTALLIZED SIGNIFICANCES<br />OF THE STEPS OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2><p>We have seen that the vision that governs and controls us in the Bible is the economy of God. The first step in God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s becoming flesh; after this there are the steps of Christ&rsquo;s passing through human living, death on the cross, and resurrection; eventually, there will be the New Jerusalem. This is a comprehensive statement of God&rsquo;s economy. Christ&rsquo;s birth, His living on earth, His death in crucifixion, and His resurrection from death are all familiar terms in Christianity. Unfortunately, however, throughout church history over the last two thousand years, both the teaching ones and those who have received the teaching have only known about these terms. Few have entered deeply into their intrinsic significances. It was not until the time when the Lord raised up the recovery in China, beginning with Brother Nee, that the intrinsic significances of these matters were made known to us one by one.</p><h2 class="head2">The Crystallized Significance<br />of God&rsquo;s Becoming Flesh</h2><p>The first step in God&rsquo;s economy was the incarnation. We have spent over seventy years on this matter, but it was not until recently that we obtained its crystallized significance. The crystallized significance of incarnation is not only that divinity was brought into humanity but also that God was brought into man that He might be mingled with man to be a God-man. God brought Himself into man to be mingled with man as one&mdash;this is a tremendous matter in the universe. In Christianity this matter is generally referred to as &ldquo;the birth of Christ.&rdquo; However, Bible readers must know that God Himself is the Word and that this Word became flesh (John 1:1, 14). &ldquo;The Word became flesh&rdquo; is deeper than the shallow phrase <em>the birth of Christ.</em></p><p>Christianity has &ldquo;Christmas&rdquo; and &ldquo;carolling&rdquo; in relation to &ldquo;the birth of Christ.&rdquo; Ordinary Christians know only the event mentioned in Luke 2, where on the night of the birth of Christ, an angel of the Lord appeared to shepherds who spent their nights in the fields and announced to them the good news of great joy for all people that a Savior was born to them in David&rsquo;s city (vv. 8-14). Any reader of the Bible can see this and understand it without any need of explanation. Christ indeed was born to be a Savior, but this is still not the crystallized significance of His birth. The crystallized significance of Christ&rsquo;s birth is that God became flesh in Christ; that is, God Himself entered into man to be mingled with man.</p><h2 class="head2">The Crystallized Significance<br />of Christ&rsquo;s Passing through Human Living</h2><p>After His incarnation, Christ passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living. Christian theology neither pays much attention to this matter nor enters into its crystallized significance. God becoming flesh was His bringing Himself into man. When God passed through human living in the human life, this was God living the God-man life in the flesh to live out the divine attributes in human virtues. Some people may realize that the Lord Jesus expressed God when He was on the earth, but they do not know how He did it. Actually, the Lord Jesus expressed God on the earth by becoming a man to live a human life in which He lived out all that God is in His divine attributes to be His human virtues. This is the crystallized significance of Christ&rsquo;s passing through human living.</p><h2 class="head2">The Crystallized Significance<br />of Christ&rsquo;s Crucifixion</h2><p>After He experienced human living, Christ went to the cross and was crucified. In general, most Christians would say that because Jesus loved us, He bore our sins and died on our behalf to redeem us. This is correct but very shallow. The crystallized significance of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion is that He accomplished an all-inclusive death. On the negative side, His death terminated the old creation (Rom. 6:6), including all persons and things related to the old creation: Satan (Heb. 2:14), sin (Rom. 8:3b; John 1:29; Heb. 9:26b, 28a), the world, (John 12:31; Gal. 6:14b), man&rsquo;s flesh (Gal. 5:24; Rom. 8:3b), the law of the commandments in ordinances (Eph. 2:15a), and everything outside of God. Thus, Christ&rsquo;s death completely removed and thoroughly terminated all defilement and corruption in the universe brought in through Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall.</p><p>On the positive side, Christ&rsquo;s death released the divine life in Him as a basic factor of God&rsquo;s new creation. Christ&rsquo;s death not only terminated the old creation but also released the divine life. His death was the death of a grain of wheat, as mentioned in John 12:24. Apparently, Christ as a grain of wheat fell into the ground and died; actually, that death was His being made alive. The riches of life contained in a seed can be released only through death. In the same way, when Christ as a grain of wheat fell into the ground and died, the life element within Him became intensely active to release the divine life&mdash;the very God Himself&mdash;that was concealed in Him and to impart it into the many grains. This is the crystallized significance of Christ&rsquo;s death.</p><h2 class="head2">The Crystallized Significance<br />of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection</h2><p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, the beginning of the new creation, has a threefold crystallized significance. In this resurrection the firstborn Son of God was produced, the many sons of God were simultaneously produced, and Christ Himself was made the life-giving Spirit. Acts 13:33 says, &ldquo;You are My Son; today I have begotten You.&rdquo; <em>Today</em> refers to the day of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Psa. 2:7). Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was His being begotten by God as the firstborn Son (Rom. 1:4). First Peter 1:3 says, &ldquo;God...has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo; Hence, God also regenerated all His chosen people to be His many sons through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Thus, God&rsquo;s firstborn Son and His many sons constitute a universal, corporate new man with the firstborn Son as the Head and the many sons as the Body.</p><p>Furthermore, in this resurrection as a great delivery, the incarnated Christ passed through resurrection and became the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of the Firstborn, who is also called the Spirit of Jesus Christ, enters into the many sons to be their bountiful supply (Phil. 1:19). This is God entering into the believers to regenerate them, sanctify them, renew them, transform them, conform them to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son, and eventually glorify them. All these things are carried out by Christ as the firstborn Son who has become the life-giving Spirit and has entered into us.</p><p>There were two &ldquo;becomings&rdquo; in the processes that God passed through. The first &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; was His becoming flesh (John 1:14) that He might come among men to be with them. However, He still could not enter into them. He needed to pass through another &ldquo;becoming,&rdquo; that is, His becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In John 14:3 the Lord said, &ldquo;If I go...I am coming again.&rdquo; His going was His going to pass through death and resurrection; His coming was His coming to His disciples and entering into them. In resurrection He was begotten as the firstborn Son of God, and in that birth the many sons of God were also begotten; furthermore, He Himself became the life-giving Spirit that He may enter and dwell in the many sons to be their life supply. This is the crystallized significance of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOUR STEPS IN GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />ISSUING IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>Through these four steps of God&rsquo;s economy the many sons of God were produced. Corporately, the many sons of God are the church; organically, they are the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is the church, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride, the counterpart, of Christ. In each aspect, the church takes the Body of Christ as its organic factor. Without the Body of Christ, the church is lifeless and is a mere human organization. Without the Body of Christ and, therefore, without the life of Christ, there cannot be the house of God, which is constituted with the children born of God the Father, and there cannot be the kingdom of God, which is the realm of God&rsquo;s life. Without the life of Christ, there also cannot be the bride of Christ who, as His counterpart, must match Him to be a couple with Him. Eve came out of Adam and was a match to Adam, so she could be Adam&rsquo;s counterpart. Likewise, the church must also have the life of Christ that she may be Christ&rsquo;s counterpart. The church as the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride of Christ takes the Body of Christ as its organic factor.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SPEAK<br />THE CRYSTALLIZED SIGNIFICANCE</h2><p>We have seen that the vision in the Bible which governs and controls us is the economy of God. We have also seen the crystallized significances of the various steps of God&rsquo;s economy. I hope the brothers and sisters will be able to see that our expressions are absolutely different from the traditional expressions used in Christianity. We have been enlightened by the Lord to have the new expressions; we must learn all these new expressions and new utterances. Even when we knock on doors to visit people, we should begin our speaking with God&rsquo;s economy. Whether one receives it or not, it is up to him; but the speaking is up to us. We should not speak the same old things which people have already heard; we need to speak the crystallized significances of God&rsquo;s economy. Only these things can thoroughly save people; so we need to learn to speak them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CRYSTALLIZED SIGNIFICANCE<br />OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>Now, we would like to see the crystallized significance of the Body of Christ. In the entire Bible, only the apostle Paul spoke concerning the Body of Christ. In Matthew 16 and 18 the Lord Jesus clearly referred to the church, but He only spoke of His Body in a hidden, implied way without explicitly using the expression <em>the Body of Christ.</em> The writers of the other Epistles, including the apostles Peter and John, never used this expression; it was used only by Paul.</p><p>Every one of the fourteen Epistles of Paul refers to the church, but only four are concerned with the Body of Christ: Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians. Among them, Ephesians touches the most central, basic, and fundamental matters. Ephesians 1 says that Christ in His ascension poured out the Holy Spirit and thus produced the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (v. 23). This is a simple definition of the church. Then in chapter four Paul, based on the revelation in the preceding three chapters, exhorts the saints, saying, &ldquo;I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called&rdquo; (v. 1). The first thing in Paul&rsquo;s exhortation is the keeping of the oneness of the Spirit (v. 3). Then verses 4 through 6 go on to mention seven items of the oneness of the Spirit. &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling&rdquo;&mdash;these three items form one group. &ldquo;One Lord, one faith, one baptism&rdquo;&mdash;these three items form another group. &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all&rdquo;&mdash;this is the third group. Ephesians 4:4-6 is the crystallized speaking of the apostle Paul concerning the Body of Christ. These three verses show us that the Triune God and we, the redeemed, are mingled into a constitution, and this constitution is the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is a constitution of the Triune God and His redeemed that the Triune God may be constituted with His redeemed as one entity.</p><h2 class="head2">One Body, One Spirit, and One Hope</h2><p>Verse 4a says, &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit.&rdquo; The Body of Christ takes God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people as its framework and the Spirit as its constituting essence. Just as our body has a framework and also has blood and flesh, so the Body of Christ has its framework and constituting essence. The framework of the Body of Christ is the God-chosen and Christ-redeemed people, with whom the consummated Spirit of the Triune God mingles Himself to constitute the Body of Christ. The believers were chosen by God and redeemed by Christ; this is something known generally by Christians and stressed particularly by the Brethren. However, perhaps even the Brethren did not see anything concerning the Spirit as the constituting essence to be mingled with the believers.</p><p>Verse 4b says, &ldquo;Even as also you were called in one hope of your calling.&rdquo; Here, hope refers to the transformation of the redeemed. Since the day we were called, we have had the hope that we will be transformed. The Old Testament portrays us as maggots and worms (Job 25:6). Paul also said that he was the foremost among sinners (1 Tim. 1:15b). The Lord has saved us, and what is our hope? Our hope is that we will be transformed! Who will transform us? The Spirit. The Spirit comes first to regenerate us; then He sanctifies us, renews us, transforms us, conforms us to the image of God&rsquo;s Firstborn, and eventually glorifies us that our body may be saturated with glory, thus shining forth the divine glory. This is our hope. The process from regeneration to glorification is a process of transformation; this transformation is our hope.</p><h2 class="head2">One Lord, One Faith, and One Baptism</h2><p>In the Body of Christ, in addition to the chosen and redeemed people, there is the transforming Spirit. This transforming Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, which is also the totality of the Triune God, comprising not only the Spirit Himself but also the elements of the Son and the Father. Therefore, Ephesians 4:5, which is related to the Son, says, &ldquo;One Lord, one faith, one baptism.&rdquo; This verse does not say &ldquo;one Son,&rdquo; but &ldquo;one Lord.&rdquo; In the Gospel of John it is the Son into whom we believe (3:16); the Son is mainly for us to have life (1 John 5:12). Here in Ephesians, the Son is referred to as the Lord, as also in the book of Acts (2:36); the Lord is for His exercising of authority, for His headship. As the Son, He is our life; as the Lord, He is the Head exercising His authority in the Body. The Body&rsquo;s relationship with Him is one of faith and baptism. Through faith we believe into the Lord (John 3:36), and through baptism we are baptized into Him (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3) and terminated in Adam (v. 4). Both faith and baptism imply an entering in and a coming out. We came out of Adam and have entered into Christ. Hence, through one faith and one baptism we were baptized out of Adam; that is, we were buried and severed from Adam. At the same time, in one Spirit we have entered into Christ to be joined with Him.</p><p>As a result, Christ has become the transforming element in us. The transforming Spirit transforms us gradually from within with Christ as the element that we, the redeemed, may become one with Christ and be mingled with Christ as one. Therefore, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6:17, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; This Lord is the One who has become the consummated, life-giving Spirit through resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17). This Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God and who is also the pneumatic Christ, is in us (1 Cor. 6:19) and is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16), transforming us with Christ as the element.</p><h2 class="head2">One God and Father of All</h2><p>Ephesians 4:6 says, &ldquo;One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in &rdquo;all. In the Body of Christ we have not only the transforming Spirit and Christ as the transforming element but also one God and Father. As God, He created us; as the Father, He regenerated us. Both in creation and in regeneration God is our source. In the old creation we came from God and were created by Him. In the new creation we were regenerated by the Father. Therefore, both &ldquo;God&rdquo; and &ldquo;Father&rdquo; imply the source. This one God and Father as the source involves three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is over all&mdash;this refers to the Father, the source; He is through all&mdash;this refers to the Son, Christ; and He is in all&mdash;this refers to the Spirit. The Father is over all; the Son, Christ, is through all; and the Spirit dwells in all. These are not three but one. When the source comes, the element also comes; this is the Son who is through all. Furthermore, the life-giving Spirit comes to dwell in all. Thus, we see that the Triune God and His chosen and redeemed people are constituted into one unit, one entity, which is the Body of Christ. This is the crystallized significance of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">INVENTING NEW TERMS<br />FOR THE SPIRITUAL CULTURE</h2><p>Our speaking here is the crystallization of our study of the Bible over several decades. These utterances and expressions are from God. When we first studied Ephesians 4:3-6, we sought the proper explanation of this portion; although we studied the writings of others, we were not able to find the key. Gradually, God has opened this portion to us. However, we feel that neither Chinese, nor English, nor any other language can adequately express what the Lord has opened up to us in His Word. Therefore, the Lord has led us to invent some new expressions.</p><p>We must know that language comes out of culture. Formerly, terms such as <em>telephone</em> and <em>computer</em> were nonexistent because such things were not yet invented. This proves that without a certain culture there cannot be the terms to express that culture. When I came to the United States, I not only brought the Lord&rsquo;s truth, but I also brought the Lord&rsquo;s culture. Because of this, I was compelled to invent some new English terms. Although English is not my mother tongue, I needed to create some new English words to express the divine, spiritual concepts when I released the truth in the United States. For example, <em>sonize</em> is not found in the English language. In 1963, there were three groups in Los Angeles who responded favorably to us and proposed that we all come together. At that time we intended to publish a brief notice of our practice in the newspaper, in which I used the expression <em>church practice.</em> This was not a common expression in English, but eventually we adopted it because the brothers, after much consideration, could not think of a better expression.</p><p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we are a special group of people with our own culture. Since we have this culture, we need the language to match it. Expressions such as <em>processed</em> and <em> ultimate consummation</em> have become very common among us, yet they are new both in the English and Chinese languages. If we have not been weighing and considering the truth to invent some new terms, how can we explain our particular culture? This is a spiritual culture, a heavenly culture, and a culture in God&rsquo;s economy. It can be explained not with any language on earth but only with the spiritual, heavenly language. Concerning the truth of the Trinity, W. H. Griffith Thomas, a founder of Dallas Theological Seminary, pointed out that we may borrow the term <em>person</em> to define the Trinity because our human language is inadequate, but if we press the term too far, it will lead to tritheism. There is the need, therefore, to invent new terms for the spiritual culture.</p><p>When the Western missionaries began to translate the Bible into Chinese, they could not translate expressions such as <em>in Christ</em> because in the Chinese culture there are only expressions such as <em>by, through,</em> and <em>because of.</em> Yet the Bible often uses expressions such as <em>in grace, in power, in the light,</em> and <em>in reality.</em> For example, the Chinese Union Version renders Philippians 3:1 as, &ldquo;Rejoice by the Lord,&rdquo; while another version renders it as, &ldquo;Rejoice because of the Lord,&rdquo; yet the original text says, &ldquo;Rejoice in the Lord.&rdquo; Noah&rsquo;s family of eight entered into the ark and was saved in the ark, not outwardly by the ark; they could have peace only in the ark. Because of this problem, some Western missionaries created the new expression <em>in Christ</em> in Chinese to speak the new culture with new language. Today those who learn computers have their technical terms that are not understandable to outsiders. Every message that we have released in the recent two years is almost all new language, yet our understanding is still not adequate. We need to endeavor to enter into the new spiritual language that we may be able to express the spiritual truths in a crystallized way.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING AND WORKING ACCORDING TO<br />THE CRYSTALLIZED SIGNIFICANCE<br />OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class="head2">The Oneness of the Body</h2><p>The essential, crystallized significance of the Body of Christ is that the Triune God is constituted with His chosen and redeemed people to become a constitution, a constituted entity. Unless we see this crystallized, essential significance of the Body of Christ, there will be no way to carry out what we are trying to do in the church today. If we see this essential significance, there will be no problem whatever.</p><p>In the New Testament it is not a matter of the oneness of the church; oneness is not something of the church but of the Body. The Lord&rsquo;s prayer for the believers in John 17 was concerning the Body. He prayed, &ldquo;Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are....That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us&rdquo; (vv. 11b, 21). The believers can have this oneness only by being in the Holy Father, in the Holy Son, and in the Holy Trinity.</p><p>The oneness that the Lord aspired for and prayed for in John 17 corresponds with the oneness of the Spirit in Ephesians 4:3-6. We must see that the church is the Body of Christ, which is a constitution, an entity constituted with the Triune God and His chosen and redeemed ones. In this Body there is the reality of oneness. The genuine oneness is not of the church but of the Body; the real oneness is the organic oneness of the Body. In a locality, this oneness is called <em>one accord.</em> Without the oneness of the Body, there is no possibility to have one accord in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">One Accord in the Church</h2><p>The one accord is first mentioned in Acts 1. The one hundred twenty had become one in the Body, and in that oneness they continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer (v. 14). If the church in Taipei alone is in one accord, that is still not oneness, because oneness is of the Body. If you are in one accord only in the church in Taipei and do not care at all for the other churches, that kind of one accord is a small sect.</p><p>Prior to the recent turmoil in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, a certain leading one claimed that their &ldquo;nucleus&rdquo; had something that the churches in Taiwan and other places did not have. Not only the churches in other localities were excluded from the &ldquo;nucleus&rdquo; to which he referred, but even the local brothers and sisters were excluded; only a small number were included. This kind of one accord is a big division. That leading one was building up a so-called one accord, but in the end his building produced a big division. That was because he did not see the Body. If we see the Body, we cannot bring in any division.</p><h2 class="head2">The Pattern of Brother Nee</h2><p>I would like to refer to the pattern of Brother Nee. First, Brother Nee&rsquo;s study of the Word gave me a deep impression and changed my study of the Word. Second, he confirmed that I needed to give up my occupation and serve the Lord full-time. That was in 1933. At that time, I had a serious struggle for a total of three weeks, from August 1 to 21, in which I was considering whether or not to give up my occupation and serve the Lord full-time. Then in September I received a letter from him which briefly said, &ldquo;Brother Witness, concerning your future, you should serve the Lord full-time. How do you feel? May the Lord lead you.&rdquo; The letter was mailed on August 17, which was exactly the time when I had the most serious struggle before the Lord. Brother Nee and I did not have much correspondence with each other, and he was not aware of my struggle. Therefore, I felt that I should go to see him. Later, when I went to Shanghai and stayed in his home as a guest, I asked him about this matter. He said that at the time he wrote the letter he was returning from England on a ship sailing on the Mediterranean Sea. While the sea was calm and unruffled, he was considering before the Lord concerning the work in China. It was at that time that he had the feeling to write me that brief letter. Through that letter we were built together more than we were ever built before.</p><p>Four months after I arrived at Shanghai, one day Brother Nee came and told me, &ldquo;Brother Witness, we the co-workers here in Shanghai all feel that you should move your family here to stay.&rdquo; He wanted me to bring this matter before the Lord. When I brought this matter before the Lord and prayed about it, the Lord used Acts to show me that there was only one flow of His move on the earth; there should not be two flows, two sources, of His move in China. Thus, I moved my family there, and since then I have been in this flow.</p><p>Third, Brother Nee truly knew Christ and the Body. His work was not for himself at all; he did not have his own work. He never put any church he established &ldquo;in his pocket.&rdquo; Brother Nee was the pioneer, and I am a follower. Thank the Lord, he truly was an excellent pattern to me that enabled me to still be ministering here today. I was used very much by the Lord. The church in Chefoo was established through me, but I did not keep the church in Chefoo &ldquo;in my pocket.&rdquo; When Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry was suspended, I was used by the Lord considerably to restore the church in Shanghai, but whatever I did, I was always in fellowship with Brother Nee. Later, I went to Taiwan. Today you can also testify that I have never put the churches in Taiwan &ldquo;in my pocket.&rdquo; Neither Brother Nee nor I carried out our own work; rather, we carried out the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is for the building of the Body of Christ.</p><p>Because the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has spread widely in the United States, some condemned me of controlling. Most of you brothers are from Taiwan. Who among you can prove that I controlled you? From 1984 to 1989 I received a burden from the Lord to go back to Taiwan to study the way for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to go on. However, a small number of people had a wrong concept and thought that I was keeping the whole church in my hands, so they began to start rumors and cause disruptions. Their concept was altogether natural, and they did not see the Body. After my five-year stay in Taiwan I left them a training that has produced several hundred full-timers, who then went to the villages and established dozens of churches. Is that training in my hands today? In whose hands are the churches in Taiwan today?</p><p>Thank the Lord, after I returned to the United States in 1989, I decided to have a training in Anaheim. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery was stabilized within five or six years. The Lord also confirmed this training. After the war in the Persian Gulf, immediately there was a reminding within me, saying, &ldquo;Why not go to start the work in Russia? That land with a population of 350,000,000 has been under the hands of the Communists for seventy years and is now opened. Why not go there?&rdquo; That was in April of 1991. Then in May, during the Memorial Day conference, I declared that we would go to Russia. In October of the same year, over thirty people went there. Most of them were produced by the training in the United States. Now that they are in Russia, even if I wanted to control them, it is not possible. Forgive me to say this: A great number of churches have been under my care, but not one church was kept in my hands.</p><h2 class="head2">Doing Only the Work of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery</h2><p>Anyone who has a vision today can be clear at a glance that neither Brother Nee nor I carried out our own personal work; our work is the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for the building of the Body of Christ. I say this with the hope that you will be influenced by me. I was greatly influenced by Brother Nee, and I hope that you will also be influenced by him. In March of this year eight brothers were needed for the release of the word in the international blending conference in Indonesia. They came and asked me, &ldquo;What shall we do there?&rdquo; I told them that they should go there to do the work in the Body and that they should not be as they had been in the past, each one doing his own work, each one having a little region that had become a mountain fortress, and each one as a result becoming a feudal prince building his own fortress and occupying his own mountain top.</p><p>This is the reason that I have called several urgent meetings for the elders and co-workers since 1984. I called the urgent meetings because I observed that among us there was an inclination toward division. I released a series of truths that were later printed in several volumes (see <em>Elders&rsquo; Training,</em> Books 1&mdash;11). You all should read these books. I said that the age of feudalism is over and that we should no longer do the work of feudal princes. The co-workers should go out, but they should never do the work of building fortresses, the work of the feudal princes; they should only do the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. If we all do the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there will be the one Body. If only three or five people who are of the same mind go out to work in a small region, the outcome is not oneness or one accord; rather, that outcome creates division. This is the very reason for the turmoil in recent years.</p><p>If we look back, what did Brother Nee accomplish, and what have I accomplished? All that we have done is left here for the Lord to show grace to His children; the work that we have done is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I hope that we all can see this. We must see the Body of Christ and be very clear concerning this vision. This vision must become our governing and controlling vision. We must do the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery under this vision. The work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the work of His economy, the work of the Body of Christ.</p><p>In the early days of the church in Taipei, we were subdivided into four to five halls. In a certain hall several people would be joined together in one accord to do their own work. Their one accord included only those who were joined to them and excluded all the other halls. As a result, their hall became a small fortress with themselves as feudal princes. If a local church does not care for other local churches, that is a fortress under a feudal prince. Anyone who does the work of the fortress and the feudal prince will not have a long-lasting spiritual life. Although Brother Nee passed away over twenty years ago, today we still see his ministry remaining here to minister to the churches for their going on. We all must see the Body and do the work of the Body. All our problems, whether in the church or in our personal life, are due to our lack of seeing the Body. Even our wrong attitude toward our wife is due to our not knowing the Body. Knowing the Body changes not only our church life but also our attitude toward our spouse.</p><p>Whether you are doing the work of the fortress or the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery does not depend on me but on you. Do you work in your locality merely to guard your hall, merely to work on your district meeting, or merely for the locality where you are? We should not have feudal princes among us; we should have only one Head, who is Christ, the Head of the Body. What we are doing today is the work of the Body of Christ. Christianity is full of fortresses: the Catholic Church is a big fortress; the Presbyterian Church and the Baptist Church are also fortresses. Every small free group is a small fortress. We cannot see the Body of Christ among them.</p><p>We need to see that the Body of Christ is not the oneness in a locality but the oneness of the Body, the oneness of the Spirit. There are thousands of local churches, but the Spirit is one. In the Body we need to keep the oneness of the Spirit; in the church and among the churches we need to be in one accord. This is the genuine oneness.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class="msg">THE NEED OF THE TEACHING<br />CONCERNING GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY<br />FOR THE SHEPHERDING OF THE SAINTS</h1><p>Prayer: O Lord, we thank You that because of Your grace we are here; we are gathered around You and by Your word. Lord, we look to You to make known to us the mysteries in Your holy word. Very few brothers and sisters throughout the ages have entered into these mysteries. But in this last age, Lord, You have spent more than seventy years to point out clearly to us these mysteries item by item, releasing to us the secrets hidden in them. As we try to speak these things, may we not feel that we know everything. Lord, it seems that we know, yet we have not seen the essence and crystallization contained in these things. O Lord, be with us and give us the utterance; especially grant us the ability to understand, comprehend, and enter in so that we may be deeply impressed. O Lord, cleanse us, forgive us, and cover us that we may be hidden in You. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SPEAK<br />THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2><p>It seems that what we have fellowshipped in these few days is not anything new; rather, it has all been covered in the past. After more than seventy years, we may say that our speaking reached the peak at the Chinese New Year&rsquo;s conference last year. But my greatest concern is that you may only have some terminology, and that you may not necessarily have entered into the intrinsic essence and the crystallization of these matters. Even after you have entered in, when you try to speak these things, your speaking may be improper or distorted. When we learn the new and profound things, to understand them is one thing and to speak them clearly and properly is another thing. Some consider themselves as knowing the economy of God, but their speaking is altogether a deviation.</p><p>The expression <em>the economy of God</em> is rarely used in today&rsquo;s Christianity. The Greek word <em>oikonomia</em> may definitely be rendered <em>economy,</em> but people commonly use the term <em>plan;</em> Brother Nee did as well. A plan, however, is only a part of an economy; an economy consists of many plans. For example, you may have a project that you intend to accomplish. That project is your economy. The manufacturing plant, the machinery, the laborers, the professionals, and so forth which are required for that project are the different steps in the economy. Every step requires a plan. For instance, building the manufacturing plant requires some consideration about the number of stories to be built; this is a plan. This is a small illustration that you may see what an economy is and what a plan is.</p><p>In the summer of 1964 I released a series of crucial messages in the United States which were later compiled into the book entitled <em>The Economy of God.</em> In the 1980s I stressed even more the economy of God. The most complete speaking was a series of messages which began in Stuttgart, Germany in 1984 and continued throughout a number of places in the United States; these messages were compiled into the book entitled <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</em> with forty-four chapters. My concern today is that though we have the Lord&rsquo;s revelation, vision, and speaking among us, and though all have been printed in books, we still may not have adequate regard for these matters.</p><p>Our speaking concerning the economy of God has become more and more clear, concise, and crystallized. God&rsquo;s economy began with God becoming flesh to be a man and continued with His passing through human living, death, resurrection, and ascension to produce the church, the Body of Christ, which is the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the counterpart of Christ. The totality of the church, the Body, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the counterpart consummates in the New Jerusalem. This is the general outline of God&rsquo;s economy. Therefore, the economy of God is from incarnation to the manifestation of the New Jerusalem. This is the entire New Testament.</p><p>The entire New Testament concerns the economy of God and begins with incarnation. The Gospel of Matthew opens in a marvelous way: &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob&rdquo; (1:1-2). After the begetting of forty-two generations, Mary and Joseph, two descendants of David, were brought forth, and out of them Christ was born. Actually, Joseph had nothing to do with the birth of Christ; he was related only in name according to law. Although he was Mary&rsquo;s husband, Matthew 1 says that Jesus Christ was born of Mary (v. 16); it does not say that Christ was born of Joseph. This indicates that Christ&rsquo;s birth was unrelated to Joseph. Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit (v. 20) and born of the virgin Mary. Jesus as God who became flesh had a genealogy of forty-two generations; this genealogy is an abstract of the entire Old Testament. Hence, you must have a thorough study of the Old Testament before you can explain the genealogy of these forty-two generations. I spent much time to study this genealogy and wrote a book entitled <em>Gleanings of Christ&rsquo;s Genealogy</em> in the summer of 1936; the main points in this book were later incorporated into the notes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament.</p><p>God became flesh and was born to be a man, and this man was the initiation of God&rsquo;s economy; with this initiation grace was brought in. Hence, John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality. This is still not clear enough; verse 17 says even more clearly that the law was given through Moses, but grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. This word indicates that the law, which is something dead, cannot act on its own; hence, it was decreed and conveyed through Moses. But grace, which is living, is capable of coming; hence, it came through Jesus Christ. This means that when Jesus Christ came, grace came; that is, grace commenced. Matthew 1 is the initiation of the New Testament, John 1 is the commencement of grace, and the last two chapters of Revelation are concerned with the New Jerusalem. The consummation of the New Jerusalem is absolutely the work of grace in the New Testament. Hence, the last verse of Revelation says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints&rdquo; (22:21). This shows us that from incarnation to the manifestation of the New Jerusalem everything is grace. This is the general outline of God&rsquo;s economy, and the crystallized significance of its every step has been covered in the previous chapter. All the brothers and sisters among us, particularly the elders and co-workers, need to learn to speak the crystallization of God&rsquo;s economy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CRYSTALLIZED SIGNIFICANCE<br />OF THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY&mdash;<br />THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2><p>The accomplishment of the economy of God is the New Jerusalem. It has been more than four hundred years since Luther&rsquo;s reformation. Luther saw only the truth concerning justification by faith; he did not have the revelation concerning God&rsquo;s economy. After him, very few Bible expositors could give a clear and definite word concerning the New Jerusalem. Even Robert Govett, a well-respected Bible expositor who was quite good in the interpretation of prophecies, asserted that the New Jerusalem is a physical city. Based upon his principle of biblical interpretation, he asserted that Revelation could only be interpreted literally, not spiritually. In the last few hundred years, concerning the interpretation of Revelation, there is a school of literal interpretation that considers the seven lampstands as seven lampstands, the city as a city, the doors as doors, and the street as a street. Regarding this kind of interpretation, my rebuttal is that Revelation opens by saying that Christ showed all the things to His slave John &ldquo;by signs&rdquo; (1:1). Hence, the entire book of Revelation is composed of signs. For example, Revelation 5:6 says that Christ is the Lamb. We cannot interpret this word literally and say that He is a lamb with four legs and a tail. Also, 1:12 says that the churches are lampstands. Are the churches merely physical lampstands? On the one hand, this should not be interpreted literally, but on the other hand, it should be interpreted literally, because the seven lampstands which John saw were actually seven lampstands. As a sign, however, seven signifies completion and perfection, and the significance of the lampstands is even richer and more inclusive. Bible expositors throughout the generations were not able to clearly interpret the proper meaning of the New Jerusalem in its different aspects. Among us, from Brother Nee&rsquo;s study of Revelation together with my few decades of study, we now have explained clearly every item of the New Jerusalem. In our publications we have more than thirty messages on the New Jerusalem; I hope that you will all read these messages carefully (see <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy,</em> chs. 26-44; <em>Elders&rsquo; Training Book 2, The Vision of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery,</em> chs. 5-13;<em> The Conclusion of the New Testament,</em> msgs. 254-264).</p><p>Revelation says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God (21:3). This follows John 1, which says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (v. 14); that tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling place. John refers to the tabernacle in chapter one; then in chapter two he mentions the temple (v. 21). Both the tabernacle and the temple are dwelling places, and the consummation of these dwelling places is the New Jerusalem. Revelation also says that the New Jerusalem is the bride, the wife, of Christ (21:2, 9). To those who advocate the literal interpretation of the New Jerusalem, I would ask, &ldquo;Do you really mean to say that the wife of Christ is a physical city?&rdquo; Ephesians tells us that the wife of Christ is the church (5:23-32) and that the church is the dwelling place of God (2:22). Therefore, the New Jerusalem is the consummation of the church as the wife of Christ and the dwelling place of God. This is the meaning of the New Jerusalem as a sign.</p><p>Furthermore, Revelation 21 says that the light of the city is like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone (v. 11). It also says that the wall of the city is built with jasper (v. 18), having twelve foundations, and that the first foundation is also jasper (v. 19). According to Revelation 4, God is like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance (v. 3). The red color of sardius signifies redemption and indicates that God is the God of redemption. Jasper is dark green, signifying life in its richness and indicating that God is the God of life. In chapter four, jasper is the appearance of God as life. In chapter twenty-one the wall of the entire city of New Jerusalem is jasper, and its light is like jasper. This means that the New Jerusalem is the expression of God. If the book of Revelation must be interpreted entirely according to letters, does that mean that in chapter four God is simply a jasper stone? This shows that Revelation cannot be interpreted literally.</p><p>In these years the Lord has shown us the crystallized significance of the New Jerusalem: it is a mingling, a constitution, of the Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people. Perhaps some will ask where in the Word do we get this kind of interpretation. The answer is that we see in the New Jerusalem the twelve tribes of Israel representing the Old Testament saints (Rev. 21:12) and the twelve apostles representing the New Testament saints (v. 14). We also see that God is in it, Christ is in it, and the Spirit is in it. Although the title <em>Christ</em> is not used in Revelation in referring to the New Jerusalem, when God is mentioned, He is mentioned with the Lamb (22:1, 3; 21:22-23). When the Lamb is mentioned, it refers to Christ. The Gospel of John shows us that Christ is the Lamb (1:29). In the same principle, although the Spirit is not mentioned in Revelation concerning the New Jerusalem, a river is there (22:1). John 7 says clearly that out of the innermost being of those who receive the Spirit shall flow rivers of living water (v. 38). Consequently, the Lamb refers to Christ, whereas the river refers to the Spirit. Hence, we see that the New Jerusalem is constituted with the Triune God and His redeemed people.</p><p>Furthermore, the three kinds of materials&mdash;gold, pearls, and precious stones&mdash;which constitute the city of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:19-21) indicate that the New Jerusalem is the Triune God wrought into His redeemed people. These three kinds of materials are not the gold, silver, and precious stones referred to in 1 Corinthians; rather, they correspond to the gold, bdellium, and precious stones in Genesis 2:11-12. Revelation and Genesis are two corresponding ends, whereas 1 Corinthians is the course. Man has the sinful nature due to the fall, and during the course he still has sin, so he needs the silver that signifies redemption. After the age of redemption passes away, in the new heaven and new earth, there is no longer the problem of sin, and as a result, there is no longer the need for redemption. Creation reverts to the sinless condition in Genesis 2. In the New Jerusalem gold signifies the holiness of God the Father, pearls signify the overcoming death and life-dispensing resurrection of God the Son, and precious stones signify the transforming work of God the Spirit. This is why we say that the New Jerusalem is the mingling, the constitution, of the redeeming God with His redeemed people.</p><h2 class="head1">SHEPHERDING THE SAINTS<br />WITH THE APOSTLES&rsquo; TEACHING<br />ACCORDING TO GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2><p>God&rsquo;s economy consummating in the New Jerusalem is the vision that the Lord has shown us in His Word, and it is also what we have been speaking throughout all these many years. We may say that our speaking reached the peak of this vision in the Chinese New Year&rsquo;s conference last year, and it cannot go any higher because Revelation does not have chapter twenty-three, nor is there another book after Revelation. Revelation 22 says that nothing outside the book should be added, nor should anything inside be taken away (vv. 18-19); the revelation of God has been completed. I really appreciate that you brothers have come here at this time to have fellowship with me, and I also feel that I should speak truthfully to you. My concern is whether or not the elders and co-workers among us have carefully studied all the published messages that were mentioned earlier.</p><p>It is not easy to be an elder. Actually, Paul was not satisfied with the elders in the churches at his time. The first skill of an elder is being apt to teach (1 Tim. 3:2). This is not a qualification but a skill. An elder should be apt to teach, but what does he teach? According to Paul&rsquo;s word, he should teach what Paul teaches. Some of the things which Paul teaches in his Epistles are shallow and others are deep, but they all concern God&rsquo;s economy. In Ephesians chapter one he mentions the economy of God (v. 10), and again in chapter three he mentions the economy (v. 9). Today if you and I do not speak the economy of God and if we do not reach the peak of the economy of God, how can God achieve His purpose and accomplish His economy? Unless the work which you and I are doing is a part of the New Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem cannot be produced.</p><p>Dear brothers and sisters, you all are elders and co-workers, but unless you thoroughly get into all these points of the economy of God, your teaching is inadequate. If your teaching is inadequate, your shepherding will also be lacking. According to 1 Timothy 3, the first skill of an elder is to teach, and according to 1 Peter 5, it is to shepherd (v. 2). Shepherding altogether depends on teaching. If you cannot teach, you cannot shepherd. Then, what do you teach? You teach the teaching of the apostles (Acts 2:42). When you shepherd, spontaneously you shepherd by the apostles&rsquo; teaching that you teach. For example, a couple in the church may be in discord. As an elder, how do you shepherd them? Many elders would help them according to human feelings and speak to them some words of exhortation and encouragement. This is not enough. You must release some messages concerning Christ and the church in the ordinary church life. When this couple is having a problem, you should shepherd them according to the teaching of husbands and wives as symbols of Christ and the church.</p><p>You can also shepherd this couple according to the truth concerning the New Jerusalem. You may say, &ldquo;Whether you are a brother or a sister, you are a constituent of the Body of Christ, and the consummation of the Body of Christ is the New Jerusalem. One of the main materials of the New Jerusalem is transformed stone; there is no wood, clay, or bricks. Therefore, we need to be transformed by the Lord in our marriage life today. If you are not transformed in the age of grace today, you will be disciplined in the kingdom age; the Lord will use the thousand years to transform you. In any case, the Lord will cause you to be transformed; there is no way for you to escape. As an elder, I must speak frankly. We must all be transformed by the Lord; otherwise, the Body of Christ cannot be produced. If as a husband or wife you quarrel, how can you be in the Body of Christ? Every member of the Body of Christ has to be transformed. After God has regenerated us, He goes on to sanctify, renew, and transform us, and eventually conform us to His image. Today the Lord has arranged for us to live a marriage life in order to help us to be transformed.&rdquo; You should shepherd in this way. This kind of shepherding is high, proper, and fitting.</p><p>Shepherding is not as easy as what people generally call &ldquo;preaching.&rdquo; That kind of preaching requires only eloquence. Some pastors in Christianity teach philosophy, but philosophy cannot transform the saints. Only the teaching of the apostles can transform the saints. The apostles&rsquo; teaching concerns the economy of God. It does not merely teach that God so loved the world that He sent His Son to be the Savior of the world to die on the cross for us that our sins might be forgiven and that we might be justified by faith. This is spiritual &ldquo;elementary school.&rdquo; Paul left Timothy in Ephesus to charge the dissenting ones not to teach different things but to teach God&rsquo;s economy. This is the economy of God in faith (1 Tim. 1:4); we must speak it by faith, and the listeners must listen and receive by faith. In this way God can produce the result which He intends to have, the consummation of which is the New Jerusalem. According to this standard, probably a good number of elders and co-workers are disqualified. All the professions in the world have tests and the grading of service to compel people to advance. Medical doctors in the United States maintain high quality because they are regularly tested for competency. They have to read the latest reports and endeavor to advance. We also should endeavor to pursue advancement in our service to the Lord.</p><p>Thank the Lord, among us we not only have the apostles&rsquo; teaching but also the interpretation of the apostles&rsquo; teaching, all of which has been printed in our books. Therefore, you brothers need to read the books on your bookshelves. Perhaps the co-workers should be tested so that everyone will be urged to make progress. Because there was no testing in the past, everyone was loose. Only those who had to give messages regularly in the meetings were forced to read the books. After their speaking, within half a year, they probably forgot everything. Therefore, among us teaching and shepherding are a failure. Once we fail in teaching and shepherding, the whole church becomes desolate. May the Lord have mercy on us to make us aggressive in the matters of teaching and shepherding for the building up of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE GREAT MYSTERIES IN GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2><p>Let us come back to the economy of God. In God&rsquo;s economy there are five great mysteries: first, the Triune God; second, Christ as the embodiment of God; third, the Spirit as the realization of Christ; fourth, the Body of Christ; and fifth, the New Jerusalem. You brothers need to learn to speak these five mysteries in a very thorough way. We have seen the economy of God, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem. Now we will go on to see something concerning the mystery of the Spirit.</p><p>In brief, the Spirit has been processed to be the consummated, compound, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, and sevenfold intensified Spirit. When you speak concerning the Spirit, you must cover all these six points. This Spirit has been consummated and is therefore compounded and all-inclusive. The Spirit with these three qualifications becomes the life-giving Spirit to dispense life to us; as a result, this life-giving Spirit becomes the indwelling Spirit. Not only so, since the church has become fallen, the Lord has intensified the Spirit sevenfold in His economy that we may overcome the degradation of the church by such a sevenfold intensified Spirit.</p><p>John 7 says that &ldquo;the Spirit was not yet&rdquo; before the resurrection of Christ (v. 39). What does this mean? Nearly no one in Christianity today can give a clear explanation. <em>The Spirit was not yet</em> means that the Spirit was not yet consummated. To be consummated, the Spirit had to pass through various processes. The Spirit was consummated in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. The resurrection of Christ was the completion of the processes that the Triune God passed through. The first step of what the Triune God had passed through was His becoming flesh, the second step was His living the human life, the third step was His suffering of death, and the fourth step was His entering into resurrection. Every step was a process. When God became a man, He did not simply become a man in an instant, although as the almighty God He could have. Rather, He entered into the womb of a virgin and stayed there for nine months by following the proper procedure according to the proper human way. Matthew 1:20 says clearly, &ldquo;Joseph,...do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Before Christ was born, God had been born first into Mary through His Spirit. He was in the virgin&rsquo;s womb nine months; this was a process. After He was born, this man Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years; this was another process. The human ordeals, troubles, and hardships that He went through were all processes. Then at a certain time He delivered Himself up to men. People did not seize Him; rather, He gave Himself up voluntarily (John 10:17-18; 18:1, 11). When those who were arresting Him said that they were seeking Jesus the Nazarene, He immediately said, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; They knew &ldquo;I Am&rdquo; is the name of Jehovah; hence, when Jesus said &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; they drew back in fear and fell to the ground (18:5-6). Eventually, the Lord delivered Himself to those who came to arrest Him; He was judged by the Jewish Sanhedrin and later was transferred to Herod and Pilate, the Roman rulers, to be judged all night (Luke 23:6-12). The next day they forced Him to bear the cross for Himself and go to Golgotha, where He was crucified (John 19:17-18). This was a process He went through. Furthermore, He was crucified and was sent to the tomb. He lay in the tomb three days, and afterwards He was resurrected. Were these not the processes which He went through? It was through all these processes that God entered into resurrection and became the consummated Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO REFUTE TRADITIONAL THEOLOGY</h2><p>Some criticize us, saying that it is wrong for us to say, &ldquo;The Lord is small and we are great.&rdquo; Such people have very limited knowledge and take things out of context. It is based on John 6 that we say that the Lord is small and we are great. The people came and wanted to make Him King, yet the Lord said that He was not a king but &ldquo;the bread that came down out of heaven&rdquo; (v. 41). A king comes to rule over people, whereas bread is to be eaten by people. Therefore, the Lord said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (v. 57). Are the people who eat the bread greater, or is the bread greater? There is a very good hymn in Christianity on how great the Lord is. I really enjoyed the tune of that hymn, so I used the same tune to write another hymn on how small the Lord is (<em>Hymns,</em> #1110). The Lord is so small that He became our food. This means that His intention is for us to receive Him as our life. If Christ is not smaller than us, how can He be our food? Christ is not only smaller than we are; He also made Himself smaller than those who arrested Him and those who crucified Him. If those who arrested Him were not greater than He, how could they have arrested Him? If those who crucified Him were not greater than He, how could they have crucified Him? The book of Hebrews tells us that He was made a little inferior to the angels (2:9); actually, He made Himself smaller than all men. He was made smaller than men temporarily that He might become their food to give life to them and save them. Hence, it is irrefutable for us to say that Christ is small. Only those who have not studied the Word deeply would say that we are wrong.</p><p>The embodiment of God is Christ, the realization of Christ is the Spirit, the issue of the Spirit is the Body of Christ, and the consummation of the Body of Christ is the New Jerusalem. These five mysteries cannot be clearly explained by today&rsquo;s traditional theology in Christianity. What I have fellowshipped with you is very serious, and I hope that we can all see that our commission today is not so simple. The Lord&rsquo;s burden given to us is that we bear the testimony of His recovery, and one of the main points is to refute and correct the defects and errors of traditional Christian theology. We cannot say that traditional theology is all wrong; in fact, some of it is quite right. Nevertheless, it is incomplete. The Nicene Creed is an excellent creed, and to this day it is still kept by the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches. Yet the Nicene Creed is lacking in that it does not refer to the compound Spirit, nor to the consummated Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, or the sevenfold intensified Spirit. It also does not tell us what it means that &ldquo;the Spirit was not yet&rdquo; (John 7:39).</p><p>Brothers, this is not a small thing; this is a fierce warfare. In his days Martin Luther fought against the Catholic doctrines and brought in the recovery of justification by faith. Today we bear the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery against Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Christianity. Judaism is satanic (Rev. 2:9), Catholicism is devilish (vv. 20, 24), Protestantism is lifeless (3:1b), and Christianity is Christless (v. 20). Today all the elders and co-workers need to learn the truths. We should refute and correct traditional theology, not in minor points but in the fundamental points. We must present the truth concerning the economy of God item by item according to the entire Bible. This is the Lord&rsquo;s special commission to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class="msg">THE KNOWLEDGE OF<br />THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST<br />AND THE EXPERIENCE OF<br />THE CROSS AND THE SPIRIT</h1><p>Prayer: O Lord, our hearts are full of thanks and praise that You chose us before the foundation of the world and You set us apart in this age. How great this grace is and what a miracle this is! While millions of people are busy for the world, You have separated us so that, like Mary, we may sit at Your feet to receive Your word, seek Your heart, and follow Your lovely self. Dear Lord, we do not follow the letter; we follow You. We pray that You would remember us!</p><p>O Lord, You were once in the flesh with Your disciples, and then You became the Spirit to enter into them. You were with them not only outwardly but also inwardly; You were with them not only in one place but also everywhere. Furthermore, You not only were with them all the time and everywhere, but You were in them as the Spirit and life whereby they could live. Lord, we have heard all these things, but we are still short of revelation, vision, and light. We pray that once again You would give us the revelation, the heavenly vision, and the clear light.</p><p>O Lord, cleanse us and forgive us. We really confess that up to now we are still living in our natural being and in the old creation; we still have a great measure of our fleshly element. Outwardly, it seems that we have no mistakes or trespasses, but we definitely live in our natural self, our old creation, and even in our flesh, always offending You and opposing You. We are like today&rsquo;s Amalekites resisting Your economy. O Lord, we pray that You would deal with us again and renew us. Grant us Your visitation and Your grace in every way. Amen!</p><h2 class="head1">SEVEN GREAT MATTERS IN GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2><p>There are seven great matters in God&rsquo;s economy. The first five matters are the five steps of God&rsquo;s economy, which are incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. These five steps bring in the sixth great matter, which is a great issue&mdash;the church, which is the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the counterpart of Christ. Hence, this great issue is of five aspects: the church, the Body, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the counterpart. This issue with five aspects has a consummation&mdash;the New Jerusalem; this is the seventh great matter. We must clearly see these seven great matters in God&rsquo;s economy: five major steps bringing forth an issue with five aspects that consummate in the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FIVE MAJOR STEPS TAKEN BY GOD</h2><p>The five major steps of God&rsquo;s economy were accomplished by God in His becoming a man. First He became flesh to be a man in the flesh. Then He lived the human life altogether in the flesh; when He was on the earth, people saw not a spirit but Jesus in the flesh, a carpenter of Nazareth. Furthermore, most of the people whom He contacted were fishermen from Galilee and, other than Nicodemus, very few were high-class people. This was His living of the human life in the flesh.</p><p>It was in His flesh that He accomplished redemption through death. The New Testament strongly says that on the cross Christ offered Himself in His human body to God (Heb. 10:5, 10) to accomplish an eternal redemption for us (9:12). Once redemption was accomplished, He rested. It was on the sixth day that He suffered crucifixion. On the next day after the accomplishment of redemption, that is, the seventh day, the Sabbath, He rested. His disciples did not dare to do anything, so they also rested (Luke 23:56). Then on the eighth day, the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb and discovered that the Lord had resurrected (John 20:1). Once the Lord entered into resurrection, redemption was successfully accomplished (Rom. 4:25).</p><p>Redemption was accomplished in death and concluded in resurrection, because once He entered into resurrection, the Lord was set free from His flesh and entered into another stage. Actually, the Lord was not set free from His flesh; rather, He was transfigured in His body to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) that He may move as the Spirit. The first step He took in His move as the Spirit was to contact Mary the Magdalene in the morning of His resurrection (John 20:14-16). Mary received an exceedingly great blessing because she loved the Lord to the uttermost. She was not only the first one who discovered the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection but also the first one whom the Lord contacted after His resurrection. Mary was very excited and wanted to touch the Lord, but the Lord said to her, &ldquo;Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father&rdquo; (v. 17a). This means that the freshness of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection as the firstfruits of the harvest must be manifested first for the Father&rsquo;s enjoyment.</p><p>Then the Lord said to Mary, &ldquo;Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God&rdquo; (v. 17b). Previously, the most intimate term the Lord had used in reference to His disciples was &ldquo;friends&rdquo; (15:14-15). But in the morning of His resurrection, the Lord regenerated all His disciples, including you and me, in His resurrection. Peter was so deeply impressed with this matter that in 1 Peter 1:3 he says that God the Father has regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. From then on, the Lord began to call His disciples &ldquo;brothers,&rdquo; because they all were regenerated with the divine life through His resurrection.</p><p>After His resurrection, the Lord ascended to the Father with His resurrected body (John 20:17). That was a secret ascension; it occurred forty days prior to His public ascension, which took place before the eyes of the disciples (Acts 1:9-11). These are the five major steps of God&rsquo;s becoming a man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECRET OF EXPERIENCING<br />THE FIVE MAJOR STEPS OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY&mdash;<br />THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2><p>The secret of having the five major steps of God&rsquo;s economy as our experience lies with the life-giving Spirit. After He accomplished redemption in the flesh, Christ was resurrected. After His resurrection, He was qualified to ascend to heaven. For the sake of His disciples, however, He did not ascend to heaven publicly on the day of His resurrection. Rather, in the evening of His resurrection He came back to be with His disciples, and He appeared to them through a period of forty days and spoke the things concerning the kingdom of God (John 20:19; Acts 1:3) to give them some &ldquo;private tutoring.&rdquo; Then after forty days He ascended to heaven openly before their eyes.</p><p>Christ was the Spirit when He ascended to heaven; He had a body, but that body was a spiritual body. This is something our limited mind cannot comprehend. In the evening of His resurrection, while the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, the Lord entered with His resurrected body and stood in their midst, and He even showed them His hands and His side (John 20:19-20). This cannot be explained scientifically or physically, but it is indeed the divine revelation! He came in resurrection with a spiritual body. The primary thing which He did in His coming was that He breathed into His disciples and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). This was the Spirit referred to in John 7:39 and the Spirit of reality (14:17) promised in chapters fourteen through sixteen. The Lord imparted Himself into His disciples as life and everything by breathing the Holy Spirit into them.</p><p>From that day on, Peter changed. Formerly, Peter always spoke nonsensically and wrongly, and every time he spoke, he was rebuked. The best speaking he had was in Matthew 16, where the Lord asked the disciples, &ldquo;Who do you say that I am?&rdquo; Peter answered, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; Right away the Lord praised him, saying, &ldquo;Blessed are you...because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens&rdquo; (vv. 15-17). Peter spoke a word with revelation, yet after that he spoke nonsense again. As a result, the Lord rebuked him as &ldquo;Satan&rdquo; (v. 23).</p><p>Peter spoke a wrong word again at the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration in Matthew 17. He said, &ldquo;Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and for Elijah&rdquo; (v. 4). Moses represents the law, and Elijah, the prophets; the two equal the Old Testament. Immediately after Peter spoke that word, a voice out of the cloud said, &ldquo;This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!&rdquo; (v. 5). God finds His delight only in His Son, not Moses or Elijah. After hearing this word, Peter arose and looked around, but neither Moses nor Elijah was there. He lifted up his eyes and saw Jesus Himself alone (v. 8). That was a great correction to him.</p><p>On the night of His betrayal the Lord Jesus told His disciples, &ldquo;You will all be stumbled because of Me this night, for it is written, &#145;I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.&rsquo;&rdquo; Peter answered and said to Him, &ldquo;If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled.&rdquo; The Lord said to him, &ldquo;This night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You&rdquo; (Matt. 26:31-35). Peter was such a person who spoke foolishly, but in Acts 2 when he stood up, he spoke rightly from the moment he opened his mouth. He could expound the holy Scriptures and explain the Old Testament (vv. 14-21) because the Lord had entered into him as the Spirit.</p><p>Therefore, from then on the Lord worked among the disciples but not in the flesh; He was altogether a Spirit. In 2 Timothy 4:22 Paul said to Timothy, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; This Lord is the One who became flesh, died, and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, and therefore He can be with our spirit. This shows us that after His resurrection, all the works which the Lord carried out among them and in them were a matter of the divine Spirit with the human spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">A DEEPER WORD ON THE CRYSTALLIZED SIGNIFICANCE<br />OF CHRIST&rsquo;S RESURRECTION</h2><p>Today our Lord is God who became flesh and was transfigured into the Spirit. In His resurrection He was transfigured to become the Spirit. Now we would like to go on and have a further look at the crystallized significance of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. This is another item of the result of our study of the Word for more than seventy years.</p><h2 class="head2">Designating the Human Nature of Christ<br />to Be the Son of God</h2><p>John chapter one says clearly that the Lord Jesus was the only Begotten of God (v. 14). Then, in the Epistles, Romans says that Christ is the firstborn Son of God among many brothers (8:29). Hebrews says that when Christ comes again into the world, He will be sent by God as the Firstborn (1:6). The process of the only begotten Son becoming the firstborn Son is not so simple; this process began with incarnation. John 1 says that the Word, who was God, became flesh, and this Word was the only Begotten who came from the Father (vv. 1, 14). The Father denotes the source, and the Son denotes the expression. Before His incarnation, the Son was the only begotten Son; once He became flesh, entering into the flesh, He was the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45), who was Jesus. Jesus as the last Adam was God who became man. Although this is a common word, it is not easy to explain its intrinsic significance.</p><p>In eternity past God had neither the human nature nor a human body; it was when He became a man that He put on a body of flesh and blood and partook of the human nature. Hence, Hebrews 2 says, &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same&rdquo; (v. 14). Hence, Jesus was a God-man. There was a part within Him that was God; that part was the only begotten Son of God. But in His incarnation He put on the flesh, and that flesh was His human nature, which had nothing to do with divinity. In His living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, the Lord Jesus was always with the flesh, where the human nature lies. Since He was with the human flesh, how could He become the Son of God? He was designated the Son of God in power through His resurrection (Rom. 1:4).</p><p>Paul tells us in the beginning of Romans that he was a called apostle separated unto the gospel of God, which concerns the Son of God, Jesus Christ (1:1, 3). Who was this Son of God? Paul points out clearly that this Son of God was One who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh and who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead. This means that it was God who designated Christ in His human flesh the Son of God by the resurrection power. <em>The Spirit of holiness</em> here does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God but to the divine essence of Christ, the divinity of Christ. The flesh was Christ&rsquo;s humanity, whereas the Spirit of holiness was Christ&rsquo;s divinity. Before His resurrection His human nature was not yet designated the Son of God. It was by resurrection that His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed. Hence, by resurrection He was begotten to be the Son of God with His humanity (Acts 13:33) and thereby was designated the Son of God.</p><p>Acts 13:33 says, &ldquo;You are My Son; today I have begotten You.&rdquo; Is the Son here the only begotten Son or the firstborn Son? If He were the only begotten Son who was already there in eternity, there would have been no need of begetting again, but on the day of resurrection, the humanity of the Lord Jesus was born again. His humanity was born the first time in His mother&rsquo;s womb; that was human and could not be considered the Son of God but only the Son of Man. Hence, He was called the Son of Man (Matt. 8:20; 9:6). By resurrection He was begotten again in His humanity and designated the Son of God.</p><p>The designation of the Lord Jesus in His humanity to be the Son of God was carried out by the Spirit of holiness. The origin of this Spirit of holiness was the Holy Spirit in Matthew 1. Matthew 1:20 says, &ldquo;Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; God was born into Mary through His Spirit; hence, the One who was born was a God-man with the Holy Spirit and the human flesh, possessing both divinity and humanity. Yet in His humanity He still needed to be designated the Son of God; this was accomplished on the day of resurrection. When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He died in His humanity but was very active in His divinity. This is what 1 Peter 3:18b says: &ldquo;On the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit.&rdquo; The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh&mdash;the flesh He received through His incarnation (John 1:14)&mdash;not in His Spirit as His divinity. This means that the crucifixion did not crucify His divinity but His humanity, His flesh. When His flesh died on the cross, His Spirit as His divinity did not die but rather was given the opportunity to be made alive, enlivened, with new power of life.</p><p>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said that He was a grain of wheat, which unless it &ldquo;falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; This is to die and live, that is, to live by dying; to die is to live. Apparently a grain dies when it falls into the ground, but actually that death is for the grain to live. It is through death that the grain of wheat is activated within so that the inner life power has the opportunity to operate and bring forth new sprouts. The death of the Lord Jesus opened the shell of His flesh, and the Spirit of holiness had the great opportunity to operate for the germination of the new creation.</p><p>Because a seed is living, the operation of life is activated simultaneously with the death of the seed. When a stone is buried in the ground, there is neither death nor life, but when a seed is sown into the soil, life begins to operate. It is through death that life operates. The Lord Jesus was both God and man. People thought that if they killed Him, He would be finished since He was merely a man. Little did they know that His being killed afforded Him a great opportunity for the divinity in Him to become operative. It was then that He was designated in His humanity to be the Son of God by the Spirit of holiness (the divinity of Christ) in resurrection.</p><p>To designate means to uplift. When we designate or mark out a certain object, we uplift it. For example, out of many pieces of wood, you may pick one of them. As far as you are concerned, that piece is at the top; you have marked it out. Again, for example, when you go to the market to buy fish, you pick only one out of many fish. This means that you uplift that fish by designating it. Likewise, through resurrection the humanity of Christ was marked out, uplifted, by the Spirit of holiness, the divinity of Christ. In this way the humanity of Christ was uplifted into divinity; that is, Christ was begotten again in His humanity. Hence, Acts 13:33 says, &ldquo;You are My Son; today I have begotten You.&rdquo; This begetting is the designation in Romans 1:4; both refer to resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">Bringing Forth Simultaneously<br />the Firstborn Son of God<br />and the Many Sons of God</h2><p>After His resurrection Christ still possesses divinity and humanity, but His humanity has been uplifted and joined with His divinity through His resurrection. This means that He was begotten to be the Son of God in His humanity. So it is with our regeneration. We were human beings with the human nature, but we were without the divine life and had no share in the divine nature. At the time of our regeneration, when the life of God entered into us, we were born again. We were regenerated in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. When Christ was designated in His humanity to be the Son of God by the Spirit of holiness (the divinity of Christ), we were also designated with Him as the many sons of God. We were born with Christ in the same delivery. In this delivery, He was the first One, so He was the firstborn Son; we were those who came after Him, so we were the many sons. The many sons of God and the firstborn Son of God were born at the same time. What a revelation this is! This is the crystallization of our study, which is not seen in Christianity.</p><p>We are not only the brothers of Christ, but even more we are genuine brothers born with Him in the same delivery. Just as His flesh (His human nature) was begotten of the divine nature and the divine life, so also our human nature is begotten of the divine nature. As a result, we all have become the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ, born with Him in the same delivery. Two thousand years ago, before we were born of our parents, we were regenerated. According to man&rsquo;s natural understanding, this principle is illogical, but with God there is no time factor. Today we have not seen the New Jerusalem, but in Revelation the predicates used concerning the New Jerusalem are all in the past tense because in God&rsquo;s eyes the New Jerusalem has long been in existence.</p><p>First Peter 1:3 explicitly says that God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead. Ephesians 2:5 says that even when we were dead in our offenses and sins, God made us alive together with Christ. This, however, was still not resurrection; we were simply made alive out of our sins. Verse 6 goes on to say that God &ldquo;raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Christ was resurrected two thousand years ago, when we were not yet born, yet in God&rsquo;s eyes we were resurrected together with Christ. We should believe this fact.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ as the Last Adam<br />Becoming the Life-giving Spirit in Resurrection</h2><p>Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that in His resurrection Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. God became flesh and was born as Jesus, but in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul refers to <em>the last Adam</em> instead of <em>Jesus.</em> According to our natural understanding, there were millions of &ldquo;Adams&rdquo; after Him. Since neither you nor I are the last Adam, how can Christ be the last Adam? Such a question is in the human concept. In God&rsquo;s eyes Christ as the last Adam was the conclusion because we were all included in Him. Therefore, we could be crucified with Him on the cross at His crucifixion (Gal. 2:20). Unless we were included in Him, we could not be crucified with Him. Christian theology teaches that His death is merely reckoned as our death. Actually, it is not so. It is not that His death is merely reckoned as our death; rather, His death is our death because we are in Him.</p><p>We can use an illustration here: Many Americans came to the United States in the loins of their forefathers, who boarded the Mayflower to come to the new continent and were thereby born as Americans. Hebrews 7:9-10 says that Levi was in Abraham&rsquo;s loins when Abraham offered tithes to Melchisedec. Levi, who was the fourth generation of Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, was not yet born, but in God&rsquo;s eyes he was already in Abraham. In the same principle, when did we first sin? We sinned in Adam when he sinned. When Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, we also ate it in him. This is the biblical view. This is what it means to be &ldquo;in Adam&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:22). &ldquo;In Adam&rdquo; means that Adam includes us. Likewise, &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; means that Christ includes us.</p><p>Christ as the last Adam included us in Him when He was crucified on the cross. Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit referred to in John 7:39: &ldquo;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&rdquo; At the time the Lord spoke this word, the Spirit was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been glorified. Jesus was glorified in His resurrection (Luke 24:26). The resurrection of Jesus was His glorification (1 Cor. 15:43a; Acts 3:13a, 15a). Once Jesus was glorified, the Spirit, the consummated Spirit, was there.</p><p>Today the Spirit is the consummated, compound, all-inclusive, indwelling, and sevenfold intensified Spirit. The Spirit was consummated by passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. The Spirit is also the compound Spirit, compounded with God and man plus the element of Christ&rsquo;s death with its effectiveness and the element of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with its power (Exo. 30:23-25). Such a Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ with the bountiful supply (Phil. 1:19).</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN LIFE DEPENDING ON THE<br />DAILY EXPERIENCE OF THE CROSS AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Now we will go on to see the experience of the different steps of God&rsquo;s economy. Among the several steps of God&rsquo;s economy, only two steps require our daily experience&mdash;not incarnation or human living but death and resurrection. The cross is a synonym for death, and the Spirit is a synonym for resurrection. Brother Nee said that the reality of resurrection is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection; without the Holy Spirit there is no resurrection. In John 11:25 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo; This indicates that resurrection is a person. Hence, the reality of resurrection is Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit. Today, as God-men, we should live the God-man life, which is a life of the experience of death and resurrection, a life of the experience of the cross and the Spirit.</p><p>Our Christian life altogether depends on two things: the cross and the life-giving Spirit. The significance of the cross is of two aspects: the aspect of redemption and the aspect of life. Christianity knows only the shallow aspect of redemption. Stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em> #1059 says,</p><p class="hbody">Jesus, keep me near the cross,<br />There a precious fountain,<br />Free to all&mdash;a healing stream,<br />Flows from Calv&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s mountain.</p><p class="hbody2">In the cross, in the cross,<br />Be my glory ever;<br />From the cross my ransomed soul<br />Nothing then shall sever.</p><p>This concerns Christ&rsquo;s redemption, that is, His dying on the cross on our behalf. However, Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross has another aspect, that is, our dying with Him. His dying for us is the aspect of redemption, whereas our dying with Him is the aspect of life.</p><p>In our hymnal several hymns are concerned in particular with the aspect of the co-death of the cross. One of these hymns is #477. The hymn (without the chorus) was written in the third century; later, A. B. Simpson, founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, added the chorus. This hymn is simple yet mysterious. It is a hymn of the inner life and was translated into Chinese by Brother Nee. The first stanza says,</p><p class="hbody">Though Christ a thousand times<br />In Bethlehem be born,<br />If He&rsquo;s not born in thee<br />Thy soul is still forlorn.<br />The Cross on Golgotha,<br />Will never save thy soul;<br />The Cross in thine own heart,<br />Alone can make thee whole.</p><p>This is a word of experience. If the cross remains only on Golgotha, without entering into you, it can only redeem you but it cannot save you. To be redeemed is one thing; to be saved is another thing. To &ldquo;make thee whole&rdquo; here refers to salvation, not redemption. The cross at Golgotha with the shedding of blood is more than able to redeem you; but this cross must enter into you as a tool of the Spirit before it can make you whole and save you.</p><p>The chorus appended by A. B. Simpson was fittingly and aptly done. It says,</p><p class="hbody">O, Cross of Christ, I take thee<br />Into this heart of mine,<br />That I to my own self may die<br />And rise to Thy life Divine.</p><p>This was written altogether from the subjective side, not from the objective side. The objective cross on Golgotha cannot enter into us. The cross that enters into our heart is the cross that has become our subjective experience for us to live by the Lord practically. We need to sing such a hymn again and again in our daily life.</p><p>Stanza 2 is the climax of this hymn, but regretfully most people who sing it do not pay attention to its deep meaning. This stanza says,</p><p class="hbody">What e&rsquo;er thou lovest, man,<br />That too become thou must;<br />God, if thou lovest God,<br />Dust, if thou lovest dust.<br />Go out, God will come in;<br />Die thou and let Him live;<br />Be not and He will be;<br />Wait and He&rsquo;ll all things give.</p><p>&ldquo;Dust&rdquo; refers not only to the physical dust but also to the world. &ldquo;Be not and He will be&rdquo; means that if we do not exist, God exists. In other words, we should not think about becoming somebody; actually, we are nobody. Do not consider that you are something; only God is. Hebrews 11:6 says that faith is to believe that God is and we are not. When we come forward to God, we must believe that God is and we are not. This equals to Paul&rsquo;s statement: &ldquo;No longer I...but it is Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). &ldquo;No longer I&rdquo; means I am not; &ldquo;it is Christ&rdquo; means only Christ is.</p><p>&ldquo;That I am nothing, Thou art all&rdquo; in stanza 2 of <em>Hymns,</em> #395 conveys the same meaning. Recently I read a biography of John Nelson Darby. On the first page he says, &ldquo;O the joy of having nothing and being nothing, seeing nothing but a living Christ in glory, and being careful for nothing but His interests down here.&rdquo; This was a word spoken in his old age, in which he longed to be nothing, to have nothing, and to care for nothing but to have only Christ and care only for His interests on earth. What a joy this is! Hence, &ldquo;Be not and He will be; / Wait and He&rsquo;ll all things give.&rdquo; Through the generations there were saints who experienced this. Today we should have this experience even more.</p><p>The cross that we experience today is not only the objective, vicarious death but even more the subjective co-death with the Lord. Such experience makes us nothing and makes God everything to us. As a result, we become God-men. Whatever you love, that is what you will become. If you love God, you will become God. Then where is your self? It is on the cross.<em>Hymns,</em> #631 is also a hymn on the subjective experience of the cross:</p><p class="hbody">If I&rsquo;d know Christ&rsquo;s risen power,<br /> I must ever love the Cross;<br />Life from death alone arises;<br /> There&rsquo;s no gain except by loss.</p><p class="hbody2">If no death, no life,<br />If no death, no life;<br />Life from death alone arises;<br />If no death, no life.</p><p class="hbody">If I&rsquo;d have Christ formed within me,<br /> I must breathe my final breath,<br />Live within the Cross&rsquo;s shadow,<br /> Put my soul-life e&rsquo;er to death.</p><p class="hbody">If God thru th&rsquo; Eternal Spirit<br /> Nail me ever with the Lord;<br />Only then as death is working<br /> Will His life thru me be poured.</p><p><em>Hymns,</em> #482, another hymn by A. B. Simpson, is also on the subjective experience of our co-death and co-resurrection with Christ:</p><p class="hbody">I am crucified with Christ,<br />And the cross hath set me free;<br />I have ris&rsquo;n again with Christ,<br />And He lives and reigns in me.</p><p class="hbody2">Oh! it is so sweet to die with Christ,<br />To the world, and self, and sin;<br />Oh! it is so sweet to live with Christ,<br />As He lives and reigns within.</p><p class="hbody">Mystery hid from ancient ages!<br />But at length to faith made plain:<br />Christ in me the Hope of Glory,<br />Tell it o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er again.</p><p class="hbody">This the secret nature hideth,<br />Harvest grows from buried grain;<br />A poor tree with better grafted,<br />Richer, sweeter life doth gain.</p><p>I appreciate stanza 3, which says that a buried grain does not die but lives and grows. Life arises from death alone. How wonderful this is! Where are we today? We are on the cross. When we are on the cross, we are in the Spirit of resurrection. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; The Christ who lives in me is the consummated, compound, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified Spirit. This is what <em>Hymns,</em> #539 refers to:</p><p class="hbody">O Lord, Thou art in me as life<br />And everything to me!<br />Subjective and available,<br />Thus I experience Thee.</p><p class="hbody2">O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!<br />How dear and near to me!<br />How I admire Thy marvelous<br />Availability!</p><p class="hbody">To all my needs both great and small<br /> Thou art the rich supply;<br />So ready and sufficient too<br /> For me now to apply.</p><p class="hbody">Thy sweet anointing with Thy might<br /> In weakness doth sustain;<br />By Thy supply of energy<br /> My strength Thou dost maintain.</p><p class="hbody">Thy law of life in heart and mind<br /> My conduct regulates;<br />The wealth of Thy reality<br /> My being saturates.</p><p class="hbody">O Thou art ever one with me,<br /> Unrivaled unity!<br />One spirit with me all the time<br /> For all eternity!</p><h2 class="head1">ONLY THE EXPERIENCE<br />OF THE CROSS AND THE SPIRIT<br />BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE THE CHURCH</h2><p>The aforementioned hymns speak forth the experience of the cross and the Spirit. Today on the one hand, we are on the cross, and on the other hand, we are living in the Spirit. This issues in the church, the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride of Christ. When we live the life of the cross and the Spirit, an issue with five aspects is brought forth.</p><p>Our living today must be the life of the cross and the Spirit. May the Lord cover me with His precious blood to say this: During the turmoil in recent years, I do not know how many slanderous and defaming words were aimed at me, but I did not say anything; I just let the Lord speak. This is the cross and the Spirit. I received great help from Brother Nee in this matter. When I was working with him throughout those eighteen years, I saw that all the opposers&rsquo; attacks were aimed at him; yet he just smiled and said nothing. He truly was one who experienced the cross and the Spirit.</p><p>Husbands and wives must also experience the cross and the Spirit continually in their living. Not to mention the big things, but even in small, ordinary things between husbands and wives, we should always say, &ldquo;I am not; I am dying on the cross.&rdquo; Before we speak to our spouse, we must ask, &ldquo;Is this I speaking or the Lord speaking?&rdquo; To practice this is to remain on the cross. All day long we should have this kind of experience. This is the normal Christian life. When we die on the cross, the Lord is brought forth in the Spirit, and the issue is the church.</p><p>Without the cross and the Spirit, there is no church. What we have is just a club; it is neither the church nor the Body of Christ. Neither is it the house of God, because it is we who act as lord. It is not the kingdom of God, because it is we who act as king. It cannot be the counterpart of Christ, because Christ is a God-man, so His counterpart must also be a God-man. Without the cross and the Spirit, there is only man without God, so there is no God-man. Hence, we must experience the cross and the Spirit daily that there may be an issue with five aspects&mdash;the church, the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the counterpart of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class="msg">THE CROSS AND THE SPIRIT AND<br />THE BUILDING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, You know that this meeting is both critical and crucial, so we need Your presence. We pray that You would lead us into Your fellowship. O Lord, we pray that You would give us the accurate feeling and best judgment concerning these spiritual matters. Save us from making mistakes. Amen!</p><h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p>In this chapter we will still speak concerning the cross and the Spirit. The cross denotes death, whereas the Spirit denotes resurrection. The life we God-men live in the Body of Christ should be a life of death and resurrection. Death brings us out of Adam, out of the old creation. Christ&rsquo;s death terminated the old creation, which includes us; we are the major constituents of the old creation. Today the life that we live in the Body of Christ is a life of being delivered out of Adam and the termination of the old creation. However, this is merely the negative side. We do not stop here. We still have the positive side of entering into Christ and the new creation. According to the principle of the New Testament, the cross issues in resurrection. On the cross Christ terminated the old creation for us that we might be delivered out of the realm of Adam; in resurrection He has made us alive and has brought us into His new creation. It is in the new creation that we can accomplish God&rsquo;s economy.</p><p>The five major steps of God&rsquo;s economy are incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. According to the New Testament principle, resurrection is joined with ascension and vice versa. When resurrection is mentioned, it includes ascension. Of these five major steps of God&rsquo;s economy, only His crucifixion and resurrection are real and practical in us. We cannot experience His incarnation; Christ alone carried it out. Neither, in a certain sense, do we need to experience His human living. However, in our living in the Body of Christ we need to experience the cross ceaselessly and experience death continually, because if there is no death, there is no life. Death is not the end; rather, only when there is death can there be life. Actually, death and life are two sides of one thing. When a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, there is death outwardly, but there is actually life inwardly (John 12:24). When the grain undergoes a transformation in the soil, there is death without but life within. Hence, if there is no death, there is no life; once there is death, there is life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF DEATH AND RESURRECTION<br />BRINGING FORTH THE ISSUE OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2><h2 class="head2">Truth Needing Experience to Become Reality</h2><p>In the preceding chapter we saw the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride of Christ. These are the five aspects of one issue. This issue with five aspects is produced out of death and resurrection. If Christ had not died and resurrected, He could not produce the church, and therefore there could not be the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride of Christ. This is the fact and the truth, but it is still not the experience. The church is definitely produced by Christ, but without our experience there is no reality. This fact, this truth, must be carried out in us; then it becomes our experience. Let us use regeneration as an example. We were regenerated in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3); however, unless we believe into Christ and receive Him in time, we cannot experience regeneration. Hence, the fact, the truth, must be experienced and carried out by us. Then it becomes a real, practical matter to us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Type of Adam and Eve</h2><p>Before the ages, in eternity past, God chose millions of people, including you and me. Then in time He created Adam. He did not create us directly. Genesis tells us that God created only one man; then He took a rib out of Adam&rsquo;s side and made it into a woman. Hence, out of the one man Adam, men proliferated. They became fruitful and they multiplied, replenishing the whole earth (Gen. 1:27-28).</p><p>Before the woman was built, Adam might have felt lonely and bored. He was seeking a counterpart. Therefore, God said, &ldquo;It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him&rdquo; (2:18). Then God brought every living thing that He had created to Adam. Adam had not studied biology, yet he gave names to all the living creatures. However, he did not find his counterpart. When he finished his seeking, God caused him to have a deep sleep and operated on him by taking a rib out of him. Adam&rsquo;s being in a deep sleep with his side opened indicates death. The bone, which is a type of resurrection, signifies death and resurrection. God enlarged that rib and built it into a woman who was like Adam, and God brought her to Adam (vv. 19-22). When Adam saw her, he said, &ldquo;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man&rdquo; (v. 23). Verse 24 continues, &ldquo;Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.&rdquo; This is a clear picture portraying the bringing forth and building of the church and the practical living of the church.</p><h2 class="head2">The Practical Experience</h2><p>We must see that in order to have the church, the Body of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, and the bride of Christ, death is necessary. We must allow God to operate on us; this is to experience the cross. To be conformed to His death, as mentioned in Philippians 3:10, is to be made the same as the form of Christ&rsquo;s death, that is, to take Christ&rsquo;s death as the mold of our life. In our daily living of the church life, the life of the Body of Christ, we need to be conformed to His death. <em>Hymns,</em> #631 is a short hymn consisting of only three stanzas, but almost every line is a new utterance. Stanza 2 says,</p><p class="hbody">If I&rsquo;d have Christ formed within me,<br /> I must breathe my final breath,<br />Live within the Cross&rsquo;s shadow,<br /> Put my soul-life e&rsquo;er to death.</p><p>It is only in this way that Christ can be formed in us. Such a hymn has the practical experience as well as the fact and the truth.</p><p>What we have been speaking is the utterance and expression given to us by the Lord. Traditional theologians in Christianity say that we should not create new terms lightly. They say that it was all right for the church fathers to create expressions such as <em>the Triune God,</em> but we should not create any more new expressions lest we stir up trouble. This is due to their ignorance of the truth and their deficiency in experience. Language is a product of culture. If a certain thing exists in a certain culture, there is a definite term in that culture to express that thing. Stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em>#631 says, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d know Christ&rsquo;s risen power, / I must ever love the Cross.&rdquo; The Chinese translation of the second line reads, &ldquo;I must ever love the mold of the cross.&rdquo; &ldquo;The mold of the cross&rdquo; is an expression created by us, but actually it is not, because it is based on what Paul says concerning our being conformed to the death of Christ. The Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross is an accomplished fact. Paul, after receiving this revelation, saw the application of the fact and therefore wrote the truth of being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death in Philippians 3:10. Later, many saints, such as Madame Guyon, one of the inner-life people, A. B. Simpson, and Mrs. Penn-Lewis, all saw this truth and experienced this fact. In these years since we have seen something of the Lord and have received from the saints who were before us, we have found out that there is the need to have a new vocabulary to express the truths which we have seen.</p><p>Stanza 3 says,</p><p class="hbody">If God thru th&rsquo; Eternal Spirit<br />Nail me ever with the Lord;<br />Only then as death is working<br />Will His life thru me be poured.</p><p>These are words from the human race, but they are utterances in the divine culture. This is the new language in the new culture that is incomprehensible to those who are not saved and to those who have no experience. They may appreciate the poetry of this hymn, but they do not understand its content or know what it means when it says, &ldquo;If no death, no life.&rdquo; This is the language of the heavenly kingdom that can be understood only by the saints who live the heavenly life.</p><p>Today if we want to have the church life and experience the Body of Christ, we must experience the cross and death. Take the family life as an example. The biggest problem between a husband and wife is that they always have different opinions, ideas, and ways. It is strange that among the couples, a slow one usually is matched with a quick one. It is seldom that both are quick or both are slow. Since one is slow and the other one is quick, the slow one complains about the quick one, and the quick one cannot stand the slow one. Sometimes the husband is sick and wants a drink of water, yet after a long time the wife still has not come with the water, and the husband fumes for being kept waiting. Not only has sickness caused the husband to become thirsty, but the waiting has also caused him to experience death. This is the problem with being slow. On the other hand, being quick also has its shortcomings. Some people clean the table after a meal by hastily removing all the bowls and chopsticks, yet the table is not clean and is still very messy. They wash the bowls quickly, but the bowls are not clean. They draw the water quickly, but the water is not hot enough. We have many such incidents happening in our family life. The secret to solving these problems is,</p><p class="hbody">If I&rsquo;d know Christ&rsquo;s risen power,<br />I must ever love the Cross;<br />Life from death alone arises;<br />There&rsquo;s no gain except by loss.</p><p>If there is no death, there is no life; if there is death, there is life. If we sing this hymn and experience the death of the cross, there will be no problems.</p><p>We should not just speak about the objective doctrine of the cross and the Spirit; we must have the practical experience. Sometimes the elders in the church argue over a certain matter that is brought up because they all have their own views. The Chinese have a saying that since we all have different views, we need to be broad-minded and forbearing. But how we can be broad-minded? We have to prepare ourselves, saying, &ldquo;I have died, so I have no opinions, no views, no ways.&rdquo; I speak this from my own experience. When I first served as an elder, I also felt that I should be more yielding, but regardless of how much I tried, I could not make it. The northern Chinese have a saying that some people carry a club at their side to bully others into yielding, but they continue to hit them after they have yielded. People who behave in this way are truly unconscionable; they feel that they are the only ones of importance. We often consider that this is the way we are treated in the church coordination. As a result, we may go home with no appetite for eating, and after a period of time begin to have ulcers and even tuberculosis. Hence, the following lines in <em>Hymns,</em> #477 are excellent:</p><p class="hbody">The Cross on Golgotha,<br />Will never save thy soul;<br />The Cross in thine own heart,<br />Alone can make thee whole.</p><p>Our opinions are a sickness that can be cured only by the cross. When the cross comes into us, we are finished and have no more opinions.</p><p>In 1933 Brother Nee brought me into the co-workers&rsquo; meetings in Shanghai.  Because I was of the younger generation, even the youngest, I learned some tremendous lessons there. Quite often, instead of asking the other brothers, Brother Nee would ask me, &ldquo;Brother Witness, what is your view concerning this matter?&rdquo; Usually I just smiled and said, &ldquo;Brother Nee, whatever you say, I will do; I have no opinion.&rdquo; After a long period of time, Brother Nee knew what my answer would be. Afterwards, we worked together for eighteen years, but he would not ask me anything because he knew that it was useless to ask, since I would do whatever he said. I behaved like this not only with Brother Nee but also with the other co-workers. I would always do according to whatever they would say.</p><p>I have given the following illustration: Three elders have decided to go from Taipei to Keelung, but they argue a great deal about how to get there. It takes an hour to get there by car, but after a long time they have not started their trip because they are arguing, and no one is willing to give in. If they would have stopped arguing, they could have already arrived at Keelung. Such things have happened frequently in the church. Often the elders would argue even to the extent that they have delayed the important affairs of the church, yet all they care about is just to argue. In the co-workers&rsquo; meetings someone may disagree with something but not speak up during the meeting; then after the meeting they criticize. I saw such things happen again and again. Therefore, I often say in the co-workers&rsquo; meetings that if you have something to say, say it openly and not behind someone&rsquo;s back. Some of the elders&rsquo; wives are very knowledgeable concerning the matters fellowshipped among the elders because their husbands like to bring those matters home to discuss with them. The elders are somewhat reserved when they argue in the meetings, but when they go home, they break loose and pour out everything. Consequently, their wives know everything, and even their children hear things and are affected. Such things happen repeatedly because of the shortage of the experience of the cross.</p><p>On the other hand, even though we do not argue or fight, if we do not remain in the Spirit through death, whatever we do, we are not the church; rather, we are merely a social organization. What is the church? As those who have received grace and love, we have been redeemed by the Lord and have been enlightened by Him to see that we need to die that He may live in us. The Spirit lives when we have the cross in us. Moreover, when we have such experience daily, what is lived out is the church. This is not merely the church in fact or the church in doctrine; it is the church in experience. If we check with ourselves seriously in this light, we will see that very few churches are genuine churches in experience. Who is living in the shadow of the cross day by day and putting the soul-life to death moment by moment? Without such a living, how can there be the genuine church in experience?</p><p>Dear brothers, if we see this, there will be no problems at all. Neither exhortation nor rebuke works; the only thing that works is to help everyone to know the cross and the Spirit. He who sees this has more death, and he who has more death has more life. &ldquo;Life from death alone arises.&rdquo; There can be life only through death.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE CROSS AND THE SPIRIT<br />AND THE BUILDING OF THE MUTUAL<br />DWELLING PLACE OF GOD AND MAN</h2><p>In order to experience death and resurrection we need to know the Spirit who is so wonderful. He is the consummated Spirit, the Spirit compounded with God and man, with the person of Christ, divinity, humanity, death, resurrection, the effectiveness of death, and the power of resurrection. Hence, this Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ with a bountiful supply (Phil. 1:19). He is the all-inclusive Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, and the indwelling Spirit in us. Furthermore, in Revelation, due to the church&rsquo;s desolation, God has intensified His Spirit sevenfold; therefore, the Spirit is also the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Only this Spirit is the &ldquo;good medicine&rdquo; that heals our sickness.</p><p>Today the Triune God has been consummated as the Spirit through various processes. The Spirit is the very Triune God, the aggregate of the Triune God. He humbled Himself not only to come into us but also to abide in us, make His home in us, and build in us. Ephesians 3:17 says that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith that we may be rooted and grounded in love. Furthermore, in John 14 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&rdquo; (v. 23). <em>Make an abode</em> denotes building; this is to build God into man as man&rsquo;s dwelling place and to build man into God as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Thus, God and man have a mutual dwelling place.</p><p>What we have been fellowshipping here is not being taught by anyone in Christianity. Even very few among us understood these things three to five years ago. I have been speaking these things for thirty years. Thank the Lord, today by His mercy I am glad to see some results. On the one hand, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has spread to the whole earth with churches raised up in a great number of places. On the other hand, there is definite harmony in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Since Brother Nee&rsquo;s time, we have rarely seen the co-workers among the churches moving together in harmony. However, after I came back from Taiwan to the United States in 1989, from the time we began to have the training here in Anaheim to this day, I can testify that we have had a group of co-workers here who are truly in harmony. This harmony depends on our knowing the cross and the Spirit. The co-workers visited different places through the invitations of the churches and have thereby blended the churches as one. This is a good phenomenon. Now the churches around the globe all have the desire to be blended together. There is definitely such a trend of blending in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2><p>In conclusion, we need to see that God Himself went through five major steps&mdash;incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension&mdash;to produce the church. None of the five major steps is simple. God Himself becoming flesh was not a simple matter. To God, it was not simple to experience human living. He was God yet He lived in a man on the earth to have the human living for thirty-three and a half years. He also passed through death and then resurrected and ascended to heaven. Without passing through these processes, God could not produce the church. Likewise, we cannot have the church in experience today unless we pass through death and resurrection with ascension. Consider the situation of many so-called Christians today. Where is the genuine church? We need to be on the alert.</p><p>From Brother Nee to this day, at least ten rebellions have occurred in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. At least three have taken place in the days of my ministry, and six or seven took place during the time of Brother Nee&rsquo;s ministry. The rebellions are due to not knowing the flesh, the cross, the Spirit, and resurrection. Brother Nee and I worked together for eighteen years; the Lord can testify that we never spoke a joking word with each other. Furthermore, the two of us truly did not have opinions. Only those who know the cross and the Spirit can behave in this way. If there is no death, there is no life; only by death can there be life.</p><p>The earth itself remains unchanged, but the means of transportation are constantly being improved. Today transportation is becoming more and more convenient. Whereas in the past it would take at least two days and two nights to travel from Chefoo to Shanghai, today it takes only one day to make a trip between the United States and Taiwan. In addition, the telephone, telegram, fax, and other machines are very convenient for the fellowship among the churches. This is God&rsquo;s doing in order that His chosen ones among the nations may become a corporate God-man, one Body. We need to be governed and controlled by this vision and see clearly that what we are doing is not the work of one local church but the work of the one Body.</p></body></html>
