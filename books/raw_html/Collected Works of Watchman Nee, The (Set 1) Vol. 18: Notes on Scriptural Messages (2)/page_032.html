<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE MIND OF CHRIST</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 35</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:1-11</H1><P>During the past few weeks, this passage of Scripture has often been in my heart. As Christians, we should pay close attention to this portion of the Bible.</P><P>Verse 1 says, "If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions." If we look at the words of this verse, there does not seem to be anything that we can get out of it. Apparently it does not say much. But what does this verse really mean? After reading this verse, many people think that it is insignificant, but I must tell you that it has a very deep significance. If we can understand the significance of this verse, we can fulfill what is mentioned in the following verses. We may say that verse 1 is the "soil" of the succeeding verses. A seed cannot be sown in the air because the air had no ground in which the seed can be rooted. A seed has to be sown in a soil rich and deep enough to give it opportunity to grow. This verse is the soil, the nutrition, and the source of water for the next ten verses. Without this verse, it is hard for the next ten verses to be carried out.</P><P>The words "if there is...in Christ" are very important. According to Paul, if there is encouragement in Christ, then thinking the same thing, as mentioned in the next verse, could be achieved. If there is any consolation of love in Christ, then the love mentioned in the next verse can also be achieved. Furthermore, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, any tenderheartedness and compassions in Christ, then joining together in soul and thinking the one thing mentioned in the next verse can also be achieved. If there is no encouragement in Christ, we cannot think the same thing. If there is no consolation of love in Christ, we cannot have the same love. If there is no fellowship of the Spirit, and no tenderheartedness and compassions in Christ, we cannot be joined in soul or think the one thing. In short, we must have these things in Christ in order to have the result spoken of in the next verse. If we do not have these things in Christ, we cannot have the result in verse 2.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, do you have any encouragement and any consolation of love in Christ? Do you have any fellowship of Spirit, any tenderheartedness and compassions in Christ? If you do not have these things in Christ, how can you carry out what is mentioned in the subsequent verses? If you are in Christ and have encouragement, consolation of love, fellowship of the Spirit, and tenderheartedness and compassions, then it is very easy for you to think the same thing, have the same love, be joined in soul, think the one thing, and make the Lord's joy full.</P><P>Paul applies verse 1 as the source, foundation, fertilizer and nutrient. If there were no such verse, how could Paul advise the Philippian brothers and sisters to think the same thing, have the same love, be joined in soul, think the one thing, do nothing by way of selfish ambition, nor by way of vainglory, but to be lowly in mind and regard the virtues of others? How would the Philippian brothers and sisters answer him? They might say, "Sir, although these things are good, we cannot do them. Christ can do them but we do not have His strength. As long as we belong to the world, how can we accomplish this? To love those who are lovable is all right but to love those who are unlovable is hard. I have my mind and others have theirs. I have my thoughts and they have theirs. How can we be of one mind?" Therefore, Paul took care of this concern from the very beginning by telling them that all these things will become easy, "If there is...in Christ." In order to be satisfied and full, we need to be fed first. In order to be filled, we need to be fed first. In order to be strengthened, one needs to be supplied with strength first. One brother made a very good point. He said everyone exhorts others to "put out with more strength," but he would rather advise people to "put in more strength." If one does not put in strength, how  can he put out strength? This is what verse 1 means. Paul shows us that there is strength in Christ. How very important are the words "in Christ"! Because I am in Christ, I am able. Outside of Christ I am a sinner, but in Christ I am saved. Outside of Christ I am a failure, but in Christ I am an overcomer.</P><P>Verse 2 says, "Make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing." Because of the supply in verse 1, we have verse 2. Since we are "in Christ," we can do the things in verse 2. If we have taken a meal and are still hungry, we have taken our meal in vain. If we have something in Christ, we should be able to do many things.</P><P>Why do we need to "think the same thing"? Is this possible? Can we have "the same love"? Can we be "joined in soul, thinking the one thing"? While in Foochow I spoke with a brother about thinking the same thing. He said, "Does it mean that I have to change my mind to agree with yours or you have to change your mind to agree with mine? This might be easy to do with two people, but it would be hard with three people. Which of the two minds needs to be changed in order to agree with the third? It is even harder to be of one mind among four or five hundred or even one thousand. How can we think the same thing among so many minds?" According to Paul, it is easy to think the same thing. The answer is in verse 5, which says, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." This does not mean that I lay aside my mind to be one with yours or that you lay aside your mind to be one with mine, but that we receive the mind of Christ into us. Your mind is one with His, and my mind is also one with His. If every one of us is one mind with Him, even though we are many, it is easy to be likeminded. When we set out to do something, you have your tune, and I have my song; you have your decision, and I have my opinion. At that time should you submit to me or should I submit to you? One might think that you should submit to me and another might think that I should submit to you. Neither is God's way. God's way is in verse 5: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus."</P>
