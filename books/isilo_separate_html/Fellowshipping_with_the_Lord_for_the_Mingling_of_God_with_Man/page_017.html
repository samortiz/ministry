<h2 class="head2">The Parts of the Spirit</h2>
<p>The heart is another organ that is also related to fellowship. The soul is composed of three parts: the mind, the emotion, and the will. The will is the weakest part of the soul, and the mind is the strongest. The spirit is composed also of three parts: fellowship (John 4:24), intuition (1 Cor. 2:11), and conscience (Rom. 9:1; 8:16). The spirit of an unbeliever is dead. This does not mean that he does not have a spirit but that the function of his spirit toward God is dead. This also does not mean that his spirit is unable to function but that his spirit is insulated from God. His conscience still has some function. When a person is saved, his spirit is made alive, and it is renewed to become a new spirit. The most apparent function of this new spirit is still the conscience. A new believer often feels condemned, reproved, or lacking in peace in his spirit. This shows that the conscience is the strongest sense in his spirit. In contrast, the function of the intuition is relatively weak. The strongest part of his spirit is his conscience, and the weakest part is his intuition. If he regularly takes care of the feeling of his conscience, he will have fellowship, and while he is in fellowship, his intuition will be strengthened. In experience, we begin with the conscience and then proceed to fellowship and intuition.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, the first work of the Spirit is to touch people&rsquo;s conscience by causing them to feel condemned because of sin. Once their conscience is touched, they will draw near to the Lord. Then their prayer, which is fellowship, will come out of their spirit. Finally, in this fellowship, they will receive intuition. Hence, in a person&rsquo;s experience of salvation, the parts of the spirit function in the same order: first conscience, then fellowship, and lastly intuition.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Parts of the Heart</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, in addition to a spirit and a soul, man also has a heart. The heart is not an independent part; rather, it is composed of the three parts of the soul and one part of the spirit. The Bible speaks of the thoughts of the heart. Thoughts are a function of the mind, but Hebrews 4:12 speaks of thoughts in relation to the heart. This proves that the heart includes the mind. In Matthew 9:4 the Lord said, &ldquo;Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?&rdquo; To think evil things is a function of the mind, but the Lord said that the function of thinking is related to the heart. This also proves that the heart includes the mind. Acts 2:26 says, &ldquo;My heart was made glad.&rdquo; In John 16:6 the Lord said, &ldquo;Sorrow has filled your heart.&rdquo; Both being glad and being sorrowful are functions of the emotion. This proves that the heart includes the emotion. Hebrews 4:12 speaks also of the &ldquo;intentions of the heart.&rdquo; Intention is a function of the will. This proves that the heart includes the will. The heart is composed of the three parts of the soul: the mind, emotion, and will. Thus, it seems that the heart is the same as the soul. However, this is not so, because the heart also includes the conscience, which is not a part of the soul. Hebrews 10:22 speaks of &ldquo;having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.&rdquo; This shows that the heart includes the conscience. Hence, the conscience, which is a part of the spirit, is also a part of the heart. We cannot find a verse in the Bible that speaks of the heart in relation to fellowship and intuition. If there were such verses, the heart would be a full combination of the spirit and the soul. However, the Bible speaks only of the heart in relation to one part of the spirit, which is the conscience. Concerning this point, the Chinese language is very meaningful. In Chinese the characters for <em>fellowship</em> and <em>intuition</em> do not contain the radical for <em>heart,</em> but the characters for <em>mind, emotion,will,</em> and <em>conscience</em> contain the radical for <em>heart,</em> just as the heart includes these four parts. In conclusion, the heart includes the three parts of the soul plus the conscience in the spirit.</p>
<p>Our heart is related to our fellowship with God. The kind of relationship that we have with God depends on the condition of our heart. Matthew 5:8 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; Psalm 73:1 says, &ldquo;Surely God is good to Israel, / To those who are pure in heart.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; First John 3:21 says, &ldquo;If our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God.&rdquo; These verses show that our heart is the key to our fellowship with God. Because we desire to learn to fellowship, we must deal with our heart thoroughly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Four Crucial Points concerning<br />
Dealing with the Heart</h2>
<p>There are four crucial points concerning dealing with the heart. We need to deal with our heart until it is pure, loving, soft, and at peace.</p>
<p>Being pure in heart is mainly related to the mind and the emotion. On the negative side, we need to exercise so that our mind is not confused and our emotions are not impulsive. On the positive side, we must exercise so that our mind considers only God and our emotions love only God. This is to have a pure heart, to have a single heart, and to consider and love God in singleness of heart.</p>
<p>A loving heart is a heart that loves God. Mark 12:30 says, &ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.&rdquo; Love involves the emotional part of our heart.</p>
<p>To have a soft heart refers to our will. Being soft is the opposite of being hard. Initially, our will is hardened and rebellious, but after it is dealt with, our will becomes softened and pliable. In Ezekiel 36:26 God says, &ldquo;I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.&rdquo; Our original heart is as hard as a stone, but at our salvation God gives us a heart of flesh, which is soft. Those whose will has been dealt with have a soft heart.</p>
<p>To be at peace is related to our conscience. When there is an offense in our conscience, there is no peace in our heart. Once the offense is removed, our heart is at peace.</p>
<p>To deal with the heart is to deal with the mind, emotion, will, and conscience. Our mind and our emotion need to be dealt with until they are single and pure. Then our heart will be pure. Our emotion needs to be dealt with until it loves God. Then our heart will be loving. Our will needs to be dealt with until it is subdued. Then our heart will be soft. Our conscience needs to be dealt with until there are no offenses. Then our heart will be at peace. Only a heart that is pure, loving, soft, and at peace is a proper heart. Our heart can maintain a proper relationship with God and have fellowship with Him only when our mind is pure in considering Him, our emotion is single in loving Him, our will is submissive to Him, and our conscience is at peace with Him. This is the lesson of fellowship. If we exercise accordingly, we will touch God. If we deal with our heart in regard to being pure, loving, soft, and at peace, we will enter into fellowship. May God be gracious to us!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
