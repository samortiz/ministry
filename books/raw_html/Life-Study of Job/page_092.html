<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Jehovah Charging Job<br>to Deck Himself with Majesty and Excellency<br>and Array Himself with Honor and Splendor</H2><P>Much of the speaking in this book is ambiguous. This is the case not only of the speaking of Job, of his friends, and of Elihu, but to some extent it seems to be the case even of the speaking of Jehovah in 40:10-14. Jehovah charged Job to deck himself with majesty and excellency and to array himself with honor and splendor (v. 10). Furthermore, God charged Job to pour forth the overflowings of his anger and to look upon everyone who is proud and to bring him down, to hide them in the dust together, and to bind their faces in the hidden place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Jehovah Saying That He Would Praise Job</H2><P>Then Jehovah said that even He would praise Job, that his own right hand could save him (v. 14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WITH THE DIVINE UNVEILINGS</H2><P>In 38:4&#151;39:30 and 40:15&#151;41:34 we see the divine unveilings that came with God's appearing to Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Concerning the Universe</H2><P>Job 38:4-38 covers the divine unveiling concerning the universe, including matters related to astronomy and geography. During this unveiling Jehovah asked Job a number of questions. For instance, He asked him, "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?/Tell Me, if you have understanding./Who set its measurements&#151;if you know?/Or who stretched the measuring line over it?/Onto what were its bases sunk,/Or who laid its cornerstone,/When the morning stars sang together/And all the sons of God shouted for joy?" (vv. 4-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Concerning the Animals</H2><P>The divine unveilings in 38:39&#151;39:30 and 40:15&#151;41:34 concern the animals.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Nothing concerning the Purpose of God<br>in Dealing with Job</H2><P>In the divine unveilings to Job, there was nothing concerning the purpose of God in dealing with Job. Thus, the adequate knowledge of this matter is not found in this book. The revelation regarding the purpose of God's dealing with Job had to wait until Christ came and until the apostle Paul was produced.</P>
