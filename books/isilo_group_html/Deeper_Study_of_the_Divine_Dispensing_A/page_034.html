(4) For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, (5) so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another. (6) And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them accordingly: whether prophecy, according to the proportion of faith; (7) or service, in the service; or he who teaches, in teaching; (8) or he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, in simplicity; he who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.</li>	<li>Living a life of virtues of the highest standard-Rom. 12:9-21.<br><br>	Romans 12:9-21<br>	Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cleave to what is good. (10) Love one another warmly in brotherly love, vying with one another in showing honor, (11) not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave, (12) rejoicing in hope, enduring in tribulation, persevering in prayer, (13) communicating to the needs of the saints, pursuing hospitality. (14) Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. (15) Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. (16) Be of the same mind toward one another, not minding high things, but being led away to the lowly. Do not be wise in yourselves, (17) repaying no one evil for evil, taking forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men, (18) if possible, as far as it depends on you, living in peace with all men, (19) not avenging yourselves, beloved, but giving place to the wrath of God, for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord. (20) But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head. (21) Do not be conquered by the evil, but conquer the evil with the good.</li>	</ol></li><li>That the unique Body of Christ may be expressed in the local churches in every place:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>All the churches needing:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To receive all genuine believers unconditionally according to the way God and Christ receive them-Rom. 14:1-3; 15:7.<br><br>		Romans 14:1-3<br>		Now him who is weak in faith receive, not with a view to passing judgment on reasonings. (2) One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables. (3) Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him.<br><br>		Romans 15:7<br>		Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.</li>		<li>To treat all genuine believers according to Christ-Rom. 15:5.<br><br>		Romans 15:5<br>		Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus.</li>		<li>To walk according to love-Rom. 14:15.<br><br>		Romans 14:15<br>		But if because of food your brother is grieved, you no longer walk according to love. Do not destroy by your food that man for whom Christ died.</li>		<li>To live under the light of the judgment-seat of God-Rom. 14:10b.<br><br>		Romans 14:10b<br>		...for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.</li>		<li>To live a life of the kingdom of God-Rom. 14:17.<br><br>		Romans 14:17<br>		For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</li>		<li>All the churches and all the saints on the whole earth living in one universal fellowship-Rom. 16:1-27.<br><br>		Romans 16:1-27<br>		I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea, (2) that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints and stand by her in whatever she may have need of you; for she has been a patroness of many and of myself as well.

(15) Greet Philologus, and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them. (16) Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you. (17) Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them. (18) For such men do not serve as slaves our Lord Christ, but their own appetites; and by smooth and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple. (19) For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I rejoice over you, but I want you to be wise to what is good and pure to what is evil. (20) Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. Amen. (21) Timothy, my fellow worker, and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen, greet you. (22) I, Tertius, who write this epistle, greet you in the Lord. (23) Gaius, my host, and of the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city-treasurer, greets you, and Quartus, the brother. (25) Now to Him who is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in times eternal, (26) but now has been manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations unto obedience of faith, (27) to the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever and ever!
