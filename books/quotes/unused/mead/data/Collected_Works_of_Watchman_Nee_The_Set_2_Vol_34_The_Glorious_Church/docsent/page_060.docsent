   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What did the prophet Habakkuk do when he heard the voice of Jehovah?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He said: "I heard and my body trembled;/My lips quivered at the sound./Rottenness entered my bones, /And I tremble in my place" Hab 3:16 .</S>

   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But on his way to Damascus, the Lord flashed a light from heaven around him, and he fell on the ground Acts 9:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we have truly seen the glory of the Lord, the holiness of the Lord, even the judgment of the Lord, we will deeply abhor and hate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a pity that many Christians are always talking about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even when they confess their sins, they justify and exonerate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Manifested pride as well as hidden pride are the result of blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Christians do not see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jeremiah 17:9 says, "The heart is deceitful above all things/And it is incurable;/Who can know it?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apart from the Lord, we do not know our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we do not see the Lord, it is easy for us to believe in ourselves, to justify ourselves, and to be satisfied with ourselves!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must realize that it is in the light that we see light Psa 36:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Under God's light we can see our real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who think that they have something or who consider themselves more righteous than others are the ones who have simply not met the Lord; they do not have His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, those who have met Him will surely prostrate themselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May the Lord be merciful to those who are self-exalted and self-justified!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May the Lord's glory and holiness cause us to abhor ourselves so that we would prostrate ourselves at His feet, and commit ourselves to the place of death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only then will the Lord manifest Himself in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 1:17 says, "And He placed His right hand on me, saying, Do not fear."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord not only held the seven stars with His right hand of authority, but He touched John with this right hand and said, "Do not fear."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although our Lord is in glory, He is still full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The words, "Do not fear," speak of the Christ in the Gospels; they speak of the love of the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation is a book on the Lord's judgment, but those who are constrained by the Lord's love need not fear, because "Perfect love casts out fear" 1 John 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus desires to manifest Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, some people feel that His majesty is more than His lovingkindness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seems that the more the Lord manifests Himself, the more they dare not draw near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Lord touched John with His right hand, saying, "Do not fear."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there is no barrier between us and such a loving Lord, He will strengthen us when we are weak, and He will comfort us when we are fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 1:17-18 says, "I am the First and the Last and the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord's appearance in glory not only makes us aware of our own weaknesses, but even more it makes us aware of the loftiness of the Lord's person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, what is of importance is not what we are, but what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we know Him, we will know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord's intention is to reveal Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said, "I am the First and the Last and the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What a comforting word!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because He is such a Lord, He was able to comfort John by saying, "Do not fear."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our Lord Jesus is the First and the Last and the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has died and resurrected for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He "was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification" Rom 4:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus can give us the boldness to stand before the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through His death and His resurrection, we are exempt from the condemnation of the eternal lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through His death and resurrection, we are also freed from shame before the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to ask, "Is our boast the Lord's death and resurrection?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everything else will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who are spiritually strong and well prepared to meet the Lord are the ones who have put more trust in and gained more experience in the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not that they are in any way better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This reveals the necessity of being joined to the Lord in His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection" Rom 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus" Rom 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We trusted in the Lord's death and resurrection for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should also trust in His death and resurrection for our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus has completed His salvation both to sinners and to saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need only to receive it by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should know Him as the crucified and resurrected Lord, and by faith we should join ourselves to His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our Lord is "the First," the source of all things; He is also "the Last," the consummation of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In reviewing the story of our salvation, we should realize that the Lord first came to us; we were not seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord first loved us; we did not love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know Him as the First.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But we sometimes wonder to what extent is He going to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What will happen if the Lord only saves us to the extent of our present condition and not any further?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What will happen if God stops right where we currently are and does not go any further?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is the extent of God's salvation for us?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What will happen to us?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Perhaps we should consider this in a wider context.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By reading Genesis, we know that God is the Creator, the source of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But not long after He created all things, the serpent came into the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Adam and Eve were driven out of the garden, and the way to the tree of life was barred by the cherubim with the flaming sword that turned in every direction.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The earth was cursed, and death came in. In considering all these things, perhaps we would wonder what the consummation of these things will be.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God had a beginning on this earth, but what is the end going to be?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To all of these questions, God has provided the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The book of Revelation is God's answer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord said, "I am the First and the Last."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the revelation of Jesus Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the last chapter of Revelation, He repeats, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End" 22:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the revelation of Jesus Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God will finish what He has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He will consummate that which was not consummated in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>His redemption is complete, and His eternal plan will surely be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What cannot be solved today will be solved one day.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Thank God, one day Christ will consummate everything because He is the First and the Last.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God shows us that the One who is the First and the Last is the answer to all the problems.</S>
