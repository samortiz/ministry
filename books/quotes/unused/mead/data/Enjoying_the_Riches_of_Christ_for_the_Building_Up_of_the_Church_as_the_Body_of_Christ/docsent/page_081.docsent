   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROMISE OF EATING TO THE OVERCOMERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the positive side, the Lord Jesus mentions our eating of Him at least three times.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 2:7 says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This promise of the Lord brings us back to the beginning in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the real recovery of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the garden of Eden there was no teaching; there was not even a Bible of thirty-nine plus twenty-seven books.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What was there at the beginning in the garden was the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The overcomers are the ones who overcome all the teachings, who turn from all the teachings to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus promised the overcomers to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then He also said, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna" Rev 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The hidden manna is much better than the old manna.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The old manna was open to the public, but the Lord gives the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not public, not open; it is private for the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lastly, the Lord Jesus said, "If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me" 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To dine is to feast.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These verses speak of eating the tree of life, eating the hidden manna, and feasting with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After reading Revelation 2 and 3, will you still be for the teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may say no, but after a short time a certain doctor, a worldwide famous, great speaker, may come to your town.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Will you go to hear him?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second Timothy 4:3 says, "For the time will come when they will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse speaks not only of one or two teachers but a heap of teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is exactly the situation of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not many there care for the healthy word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, most like to heap up teachers for their itching ears.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE SECRET OF OVERCOMING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In what way can we be the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Clearly, it is by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must not take the way of learning things, the way of picking up teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we would pick up this one way, the way of eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Day by day we must eat Him as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we will be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>More than forty years ago I read many books about overcoming, and I put the points into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I must testify, however, that they did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, when I was young I was taught that when our temper rises up, we need to reckon that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I put this into practice not once or twice but many times.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, I found the secret that the more I reckoned I was dead, the more I was alive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually I lost my temper even more.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I tried this many times.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I asked others what the problem was, they told me that I was reckoning without faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That puzzled me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No one could tell me what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I spent much time to find out what faith is, but I could not find the definition, and I could not find the way to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I tried again to reckon myself dead, this time with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While I was reckoning, I declared, "I have the faith that I was crucified two thousand years ago."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, after two minutes I lost my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, after more than ten years, by the Lord's mercy I came to know a little what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Faith is nothing less than Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cannot have faith in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Faith is a gift; it is something given by the Lord, and it is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be sure, if we have Jesus, we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we say, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>O Lord Jesus!", we will have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For many years, I did not have the secret of overcoming my temper, but eventually the Lord gave me the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The way to overcome our temper is to call, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Simply breathe Jesus in a little.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jesus is the strongest "chemical agent."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When He comes in, right away He neutralizes our anger.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even if we try to lose our temper, we will have no temper.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I know this quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Previously, the more I reckoned, the more anger I had.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But now when the anger comes, I call, "O Lord Jesus," and He neutralizes it; moreover, He turns the anger into praising.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is no other way to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not overcome by holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I read many books about holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are different opinions about holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to the teaching of John Wesley, holiness is a sinless perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He was absolutely wrong about this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then those in the "holiness churches" told people to wear certain colors, have dresses of a certain length, and not to paint their faces.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At first, I thought they might be right.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then I realized that the rocks on the mountains also do not paint their faces.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To not paint one's face is not holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many times I have told sisters who were trying to be holy in this way, "In many Catholic cathedrals there is a statue of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>To be sure, if holiness were a proper living, that statue would be very holy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It never loses its temper.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is always quiet and never gets irritated."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is not holiness; this is deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Following this, the Brethren said that holiness is a change of position.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In one sense this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, we eventually discovered that our holiness, our sanctification, is Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Sanctification is something living, shining, and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No human word can describe it, because it is Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we say, "O Lord Jesus" day by day, we eat Him, enjoy Him, and have Him as our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In this way it is difficult to designate what we are, for we become persons who are wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the living Jesus as holiness to us.</S>
