   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An important portion of the Word related to door- knocking for fruit-bearing is in Luke 10.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 3 through 6 say, "Go on your way; behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not carry a purse, nor a bag, nor sandals; and greet no one on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In these verses the Lord told the seventy that He sent them out as lambs in the midst of wolves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then He gave them instructions not to carry a purse, a bag, or sandals and not to greet anyone on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Also, He told them what to say first when they entered a house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were not supposed to say, "How are you?" but "Peace to this house."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The son of peace in verse 6 is the very God-chosen and predestinated one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among so many people, this one is a son of peace predestinated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now God has sent you to gain this one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The trainees who were there in Taipei saw and experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They saw many sons of peace upon whom their peace rested.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 7 says, "And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things from them; for the worker is worthy of his wages."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You do not owe them; they owe you something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Taipei some have tasted this experience already.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The visited ones eventually prepared lunch for our trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way of door-knocking-visiting people was first invented by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The burden of this chapter is embodied in the following six points, which are the qualifications of door-knocking for fruit-bearing: aggressive desperation, absolute consecration, uninterrupted abiding in the Lord, full saturation with the word, prayer for the filling of both the essential and economical Spirit, and going with the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are such a person who would pick up the new way and do it according to the trained way, I assure you that you will have a big success.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The old way and influence of Christianity among us will be overcome.</S>
