<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 6:14; see also Deut. 22:10; 2 Chron. 20:35-37).</p>
<p>Believers may not form business partnerships with unbelievers because God&rsquo;s Word says that believers should not be dissimilarly yoked. Just as God does not allow an ox and a donkey to be yoked together to plow the field, He does not allow a believer to form business partnerships with unbelievers. Since the dispositions, interests, and human goals of a believer and an unbeliever are completely different, it is difficult for a believer to practice the will of God and avoid being contaminated and affected by such a dissimilar relationship, causing him to offend God and withdraw from God. God cannot bless such a partnership. For the benefit of the believer, He will usually destroy it in His discipline. A good example of this kind of discipling can be seen in the case of Jehoshaphat, who formed a partnership to build ships with Ahaziah, who did not want God. Even though Jehoshaphat was a God-seeker, God destroyed the ships that were built.</p>
<h2 class="head2">What to Do with Profit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Have something to share with him who has need&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:28).</p>
<p>When believers have a job or a business, they should not hoard their money but should share with brothers and sisters who have need. Hoarding causes us to suffer loss; sharing causes us to have a reward and brings in more of God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;These hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 20:34).</p>
<p>Paul worked to supply not only his own needs but also the needs of his co-workers. This shows that when a believer works, his work is not only for his own living but also for God&rsquo;s work. Thus, when he makes a profit, he should supply God&rsquo;s work and God&rsquo;s workers. Every believer who loves the Lord and lives to the Lord loves to do this and should do this. If a believer keeps his profit and allows the work of God to suffer loss and difficulty, he is wrong. May the Lord have mercy on us and save us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING FRIENDS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Principle of Making Friends</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers, for what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?...Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 6:14-15).</p>
<p>The first principle in the matter of making friends is that believers may not make friends with unbelievers. We are righteousness, light, of Christ, and the temple of God; unbelievers are lawlessness, darkness, of Satan, and idol-worshippers. The nature, use, and owner of a believer and unbeliever are completely opposite. Therefore, we must be separated from them. We should not have fellowship with them so that we can have fellowship with God and become sons and daughters who are pleasing to God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Evil companionships corrupt good morals&rdquo;; &ldquo;Evil pursues sinners&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:33; Prov. 13:21; see also 18:24).</p>
<p>The second principle related to believers&rsquo; making of friends is not to have evil companionships. While we cannot be friends with unbelievers, we must be careful and not make friends loosely even with a believer. If we make friends loosely without discernment, it will be difficult to avoid evil influences; thus, we can corrupt ourselves and suffer loss.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Kind of Friends That We Should Make</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There is a true friend that sticks closer than a brother&rdquo;</strong> (Prov. 18:24; see also John 11:11; 15:13-15).</p>
<p>Our first friend should be the Lord Himself. He is closer to us than a brother. We should fellowship with Him and be His close friend.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;With those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:22; see also 3 John 14).</p>
<p>Our second friend should be one who loves the Lord with a pure heart. We should fellowship much with him and pursue the Lord together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Patterns of Friendship</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The friend of God&rdquo;</strong> (James 2:23; see also 2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8; Gen. 18).</p>
<p>Abraham is the best pattern in the matter of making friends. He fellowshipped with God and was the friend of God. God also considered him as a friend, so he was called the friend of God. In Genesis 18 Abraham entertained God just as a friend would receive another friend, especially when he walked with God to send Him away.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Intimate counsel with God&rdquo;</strong> (Job 29:4).</p>
<p>Job is also a good pattern in making friends. He was an intimate friend of God from the days of his prime.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Feared God and turned away from evil&rdquo;</strong> (Job 1:1; see also 2:11-13; 42:7-10).</p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s three friends made friends with Job, who feared God and turned away from evil. As a result, they gained a deeper knowledge of God because of Job. This should be a pattern to us in making friends.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Fully followed Jehovah&rdquo;</strong> (Num. 32:12; see also 14:6-10).</p>
<p>Caleb and Joshua were friends who both fully followed Jehovah. Young believers should especially follow their example in making friends.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;A man according to My heart&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:22; see also 1 Sam. 18:1-3; 19:1-7; 20:12-17; 2 Sam. 1:26).</p>
<p>Jonathan did not care for his relationship with his father or for his father&rsquo;s fleshly will. He made friends with David, a man according to God&rsquo;s heart. As a result, he and his descendants were not affected by his father; rather, they were blessed. This is a pattern that we should follow in making friends.</p>
<p><strong>6. Making friends with overcomers in a wasteland, like Daniel and his three friends</strong> (see Dan. 1:6-17; 3:8-30).</p>
<p>Daniel&rsquo;s three friends made friends with Daniel, who was an overcomer in a wasteland. As a result, they were a shining testimony and spoke for the Lord in the wasteland, and their testimony and words continue to shine throughout the ages. This is a good pattern for making friends in the wasteland in which the church exists today.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
