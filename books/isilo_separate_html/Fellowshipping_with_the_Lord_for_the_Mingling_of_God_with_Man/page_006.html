<p>To fellowship means to be in the presence of God. To live in fellowship with God means to live in His presence. In John 15:5 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo; When we abide in the Lord, we are with the Lord, and when the Lord abides in us, He is with us. Here, abiding denotes remaining. The Lord desires that we remain in His presence and not leave it. When we are continually with the Lord and He is continually with us, we are in fellowship with Him. This fellowship is also a union. The Lord explains this in chapter 15. Our union with the Lord is maintained through our fellowship with Him. Once the fellowship is lost, there is no practical union. Hudson Taylor wrote a book concerning his study on Song of Songs, entitled <em>Union and Communion.</em> Song of Songs is concerning our experience of fellowship with the Lord. Our fellowship with the Lord is our communion with Him. Fellowship and union are one matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP INVOLVING<br />
THE SPIRIT AND OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God is Spirit (John 4:24). Since God is Spirit, He is not with us in our physical body. He is with us in our spirit, the deepest part of our being. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; The Lord Spirit is in our regenerated spirit. Hence, we have freedom in our spirit, and we are being transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image from the Lord Spirit (v. 18).</p>
<p>Our fellowship with God involves two spirits, the divine Spirit and our human spirit. God is Spirit, and the created man has a spirit within him. The human spirit is the highest, the deepest, and the most central part of man. It is also the most genuine part of man. Human beings are higher than all the animals because humans have a spirit. The spirit in man enables him to contact God. The Spirit with our spirit is the meaning of our fellowship with God. It is the way for us to fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP BEING SENSED IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace&rdquo; (Rom. 8:6b). According to this verse, we can sense the Spirit with our spirit. Romans 6 is doctrinal, but Romans 8 is experiential. Verse 6 says that the result of setting our mind on the spirit is life and peace. This sense of life and peace must be something that we can experience. The word <em>peace</em> does not refer to peace in our environment. It refers to the peace in our inner being. When we have peace in our spirit, we feel proper, comfortable, at rest, and at ease. Similarly, the life spoken of in this verse must be something that can be sensed. When we have the sense of life in our spirit, we are satisfied, strengthened, watered, refreshed, living, and bright. When we set our mind on our spirit, we sense life and peace within. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; This freedom is also something that we can sense. These two verses show that when the Spirit is with our spirit, we sense life, peace, and freedom. Hence, God is with us whenever we sense life, peace, and freedom within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is death&rdquo; (Rom. 8:6a). Death is also something that can be sensed. Death is not only in contrast to life but also in contrast to peace. Hence, the sense of death is opposite to the sense of life and peace, and it includes emptiness, weakness, dryness, staleness, depression, darkness, not being satisfied, not being comfortable, not being at rest, and not being at ease. Whenever we have such feelings within, we must realize that we have touched death. Such feelings also indicate that we are not living in our spirit and have lost our fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP DEPENDING ON<br />
THE CONDITION OF OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Fellowship refers to a continual living in our spirit in communion with the Spirit. Our spirit should remain in fellowship with the Spirit even when we are very busy. We even may laugh or we may become angry as long as we remain in fellowship with the Spirit in our spirit. First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;[The eternal life] which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The apostles reported the eternal life to the believers so that the believers might have fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. We have this fellowship because we have the eternal life. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; In Philippians 2:1 fellowship is a matter of our spirit: &ldquo;If any fellowship of spirit.&rdquo; From these verses we can see that our fellowship with God is entirely of life and altogether in the spirit. Our fellowship with God depends not on our outward acts but on the fact that the Spirit is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Prior to our salvation the Spirit of God and our spirit were separate. At our salvation the Spirit entered into our spirit, and we were joined to Him. The Spirit and our spirit have become one spirit. Being joined as one spirit is a continuous matter involving a mutual flow. The life of God, which we have received, is neither a part nor the whole but a mutual flow. This mutual flow is the fellowship of the divine life, and it makes us one with God by mingling us with Him. Fellowship is a matter of communion between the Spirit and our spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
