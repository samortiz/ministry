<h2 class="head1">IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM</h2><p>We have seen God's authority manifested in various institutions&mdash;first, in human government, second, in the family, and third, in ordinary relationships. There is a fourth place where His authority is ordained&mdash;in the supernatural world, the universe. It seems as if we are conducting a Bible study this morning. The above four considerations show us clearly what authority is. The best example of submission to authority in the Bible can be found in the account of Michael's dispute with the devil over Moses' body as recorded in Jude 9. Michael was one of the cherubim. He was an angel who was given dominion over everything. God made him one of the archangels; yet at one time, he was Satan's subordinate. It was Michael's specific responsibility to contend for God's interest, but he was once a subject of Satan. He disputed with Satan over Moses' body. When Moses died, God probably entrusted his body to Michael for burial. According to the principle of 2 Corinthians 5, Moses must have resurrected on the Mount of Transfiguration. Michael probably was moving Moses' body to that mountain when Satan stopped him and argued with him. Michael was in a difficult position. He had God's order to bring Moses' body to the Mount of Transfiguration, yet Satan, who was once over him, would not let him do it. In reading Jude 9, we find that Michael "did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him but said, The Lord rebuke you." Michael could not rebuke Satan himself. He could only say, "The Lord rebuke you," because the Lord's authority was higher than that of Satan. This is a pattern of how we should submit to authority.</p><p>Michael did not dare to rebuke Satan because Satan was above him in God's original ordination, not because he was afraid or powerless. Here is a lesson for Christians to learn; we should learn from Michael's submission. He only said, "The Lord rebuke you." He invoked a higher authority to rebuke Satan. He dared not rebuke Satan directly because he did not want to upset the order in the divine authority. If our eyes are blind to the way God upholds His authority, nothing more can be said. But if our eyes are opened to this matter, we will realize that God will sacrifice anything but His authority. Unlike Michael, we are the new creation, and we do not have to be under Satan. God has never entrusted man to Satan, but we still should learn the principle of submission from Michael. Michael would not rebuke Satan. He only said, "The Lord rebuke you." Those who have this kind of attitude know God's authority. The book of Jude teaches us to submit to God's authority in this kind of way.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING AUTHORITY IN THE SYSTEMS<br />ESTABLISHED BY GOD</h2><p>Every one of us has to touch authority. Otherwise, we run into problems. If a man touches authority, all of his problems will go away. When we realize that all systems of authority are established by God, we have nothing more to say. Some people do not want to submit to their masters, their parents, or their brothers and sisters. Some wives do not want to submit to their husbands. Some people excuse their disobedience by saying that their masters are too poor or that their husbands or brothers are not worthy of their submission. Some children, who have graduated from universities, think that their parents are too old-fashioned. They think they know more than their parents. This becomes an excuse for not obeying their parents. Many people have problems with other men. If we look around, we will find that many people are asking these questions. Everyone who has not touched authority has these kinds of problems. Some wives despise their husbands; they even fight with their husbands. Some children disobey their parents and argue with them. Some servants ignore or argue with their masters when they cannot submit to them. Some ignore the law when they face corrupt officers or unjust legislation. But whether or not our husband, our parents, or our representatives in the government are evil is none of our business. If we have touched authority, we will not criticize them. The whole issue rests on whether or not we have touched authority. Once we have touched authority, these problems are no longer problems. If a person sees only men, he cannot be of any use to the Lord. We have to realize that the systems of authority established among human society are established and ordained by God. Once we touch God and His authority, all problems go away.</p><p>Yesterday we quoted some examples from the Old Testament to illustrate the matter of rebellion. Even though Moses was wrong when he married the Cushite woman, his sister and brother should not have reviled him rashly because he was God's deputy authority. A deputy authority may be wrong, but it is not our business to criticize him. Our business is to submit to authority. Whether or not masters, husbands, parents, and those in authority have a problem in themselves is not our concern. We need to know only one thing: If we do not submit to them, we have a problem. A person who tries to confront God's deputy authority always runs into problems. We may think that our master or our husband is not as good as we are. This thought exists because we have touched these people only. When we only touch people, we encounter problems. But if we touch authority, we will not have a problem. Some servants only touch their masters. Some children only touch their parents. Some only touch their brothers and sisters. These ones do not have a way to go on because they are only touching men; they have not touched authority and are not willing to yield. A person is useless if he continues to criticize the government, those in authority, parents, superiors, or elders in the church. All of his spiritual power will leak away. He is taking the way of Satan and acting according to his principle.</p><h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING THE DIVINE SYSTEM OF AUTHORITY</h2><p>Since the beginning of the world, God has been ruling and upholding the entire universe with His authority. Both man's fall and the fall of the universe had their source in rebellion. Rebellion has thrown off authority. If we do not deal with this basic issue, we will be useless no matter where we go. We will be unable to work in any place. We cannot preach the gospel of Christ and perform God's work or service while taking Satan's way and maintaining his principle. Once we touch and apprehend God's authority, we will know that God created and maintains the universe by His authority. He has placed His system of authority in everything. We have to uphold the system God has ordained. We have to learn to submit to men and not to touch authority in a light way. In all these relationships we have to learn to know authority and practice obedience. We have to know that there are lords and masters in everything; we cannot assume to be the master as soon as we touch something. We have to learn obedience through many situations. One finds authority in the hospital. As soon as he works in a hospital, he has to obey the authority in the hospital. There is even authority in a restaurant. Some serve as managers, and we have to learn to obey them. If we touch authority in a genuine way, we will find authority wherever we go. In obeying the authority of earthly institutions, we are actually obeying God because all authorities are from God. We have to see that every authority is from God. Only a rebellious and proud man is blind to authority; only he will not submit to God's deputy authority. If we cannot submit to His deputy authority, or if we say that we do not sense God's authority on earth today, we are not qualified to touch God's work; we cannot work for the Lord.</p><p>During the past three days, I have stressed authority. I feel that my utterance is still short. Within myself I know what authority is. Brothers and sisters, we have to ask for mercy to see authority. Our inner being has to be so fine that we will feel what Michael felt when he faced Satan's authority. The church on earth bears the testimony of submission. If the church does not submit, what will it be like? We have to learn to obey when placed under all kinds of circumstances and systems. We should never consider one who rebels and offends authority as a hero. A rebellious person is never a hero. If all the sons of God would stand on the ground of submission, the activities of the lawless ones would be suppressed. Second Thessalonians says that the mystery of lawlessness is now operating, but there is one who is now restraining (2:7). Who is this restraining one? He is not a nominal Christian or a rebellious Christian. Our obedience is what prevents the mystery of Satan's lawlessness from operating. This is a fundamental issue. If this issue is not resolved, no work can follow, because we will still be Satan's men. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we see God's authority in all human institutions.</p>
