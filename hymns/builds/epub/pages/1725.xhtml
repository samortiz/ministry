<div class='line'><b>1</b> What made You, Lord, to die for me?</div>
<div class='line'>Why would You die for me, Your enemy?</div>
<div class='line'>You took my place to hang on a tree,</div>
<div class='line'>To be a curse, a curse for me.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>What made You die for me?</div>
<div class='line'>I was Your enemy.</div>
<div class='line'>Lord, You became a curse for me.</div>
<div class='line'>O what a mystery,</div>
<div class='line'>My God, You died for me!</div>
<div class='line'>You died for me, Your enemy.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> I never thought that You would be</div>
<div class='line'>So full of love and tender mercy.</div>
<div class='line'>How could You love a person like me?</div>
<div class='line'>You loved me, dear Jesus, Your enemy.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> You loved me, Lord, so very long;</div>
<div class='line'>And with a love enduring and strong.</div>
<div class='line'>Although I mocked and cursed You so long,</div>
<div class='line'>You waited and prayed for me all along.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> I was a man who was just sin,</div>
<div class='line'>Which issued in a life full of sins.</div>
<div class='line'>My heart toward You was in rebellion,</div>
<div class='line'>But, Lord, You touched me with Your compassion.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>Your love has conquered me,</div>
<div class='line'>Even Your enemy.</div>
<div class='line'>In love, dear Lord, You came to me.</div>
<div class='line'>Nothing could change me</div>
<div class='line'>But love and mercy.</div>
<div class='line'>Your love, dear Lord, has conquered me.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> One little turn and You were there,</div>
<div class='line'>Waiting for me with Your loving care.</div>
<div class='line'>How could I still remain Your enemy?</div>
<div class='line'>Your love, dear Jesus, disarmed me.</div>
