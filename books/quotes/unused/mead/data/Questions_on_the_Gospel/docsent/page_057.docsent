   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Believing and Good Works</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people think, "I am a sinner and need to have good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being saved just by believing in Jesus is too cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I should believe in Jesus and do good works so that I will be assured of being saved."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But this is not the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although God saves us unto good works, that is, we have been "created in Christ Jesus for good works" Eph 2:10 and "prepared unto every good work" 2 Tim 2:21 , nevertheless, we must remember that the Bible tells us that good works come after being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Salvation is not a result of good works, nor is it the result of good works in addition to believing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A child cannot walk before he is born; in like manner, we have to be reborn first, and then good works come.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is impossible to expect a person to do good works before he is reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 4:4 through 6 says, "Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even as David also speaks blessing on the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The wages of the one who works are not accounted according to grace but according to what is due.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He deserves his wages because he has done a good work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the faith of the one who does not work but believes let us note the word "believes" on Him who justifies the ungodly is accounted as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can be saved not by works but by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Something else in addition to believing is not needed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must remember that faith alone is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>David said that "the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works" was blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Apart from works" shows that salvation has nothing to do with works.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians 2:8 through 10 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 8 and 9 tell us that we are saved by grace through the faith which God has given to us and not by our own works.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 10 tells us that God has saved us to do the good works which He prepared for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are saved by grace through faith; after being saved we should do the good works which God prepared for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Believing and Praying</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some people think that praying should also be a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They do not realize that salvation is by faith not by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since the Lord Jesus Christ has already borne our sins and been judged by God, we do not even need to pray; all we have to do is believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To pray is to ask God to do something, but to believe is to accept what God has already accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We believe that God has judged Jesus Christ and that Christ has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The cross has fully accomplished the work of redemption so that whoever believes in what God has done shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, someone may ask, "Does not Romans 10:13 say that whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved'?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Does this not show us that we must pray to be saved and that if we do not pray we will not be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But let us read the following verse which says, "How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Believing comes first, and calling comes after.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First there is the believing, and then there is the calling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To call is an expression of faith it is not an independent or additional requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Believing includes calling, and believing spontaneously produces calling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, the calling in this verse is not an ordinary plea; it is an invoking of the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is similar to what was spoken in the previous text about confessing the Lord Jesus with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is also referred to in 1 Corinthians 12:3: "No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The name of the Lord is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord or says that Jesus is Lord will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Can one say Jesus is Lord if he does not believe that Jesus is Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the other hand, can one who believes that Jesus is Lord not say that Jesus is Lord or call on His name?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, prayer is not a requirement of being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Faith and faith alone is the requirement.</S>
