Lord, come in and open Yourself to us, and may we also open ourselves to You. We ask that there will be a transaction, a traffic, between You and us. Lord, deliver us from the oldness. Deliver us from the old knowledge and from traditional things, things that we have been keeping for years. Lord, forgive us and cleanse us and cover us with Your prevailing blood against the enemy in every way. Releasing Your word is a battle, so, Lord, we hide ourselves in You. We hide ourselves under the blood of the Lamb. Lord, strengthen us and pour out Yourself upon us in a sevenfold intensified way. Lord, touch us and speak to us, making us one spirit with You. Thank You. Amen.<p>The title of this message is &#8220;To Know This Age.&#8221; Here we are using the word age to refer not to the age of the world in a general way but to the age of today&#8217;s Christianity in a particular way, especially in relation to the revelation of the Scriptures, the divine truths, and the genuine and proper theology.<p>The first matter covered in the Scriptures is God Himself. The revelation concerning God involves God&#8217;s person, and God&#8217;s person is very mysterious. He is one, yet three; hence, He is triune. The different understandings of the Divine Trinity have been a major factor, a hidden element, of all the problems in today&#8217;s Christianity. Christianity has been divided by the different concepts of the Divine Trinity.<p>Understanding the second (Christ) and the third (the Spirit) of the Divine Trinity has been most bothersome and troublesome. Who is Christ? In answer to this question, most Christians would say that Christ is the Son of God. However, many believers do not realize that Christ is not merely the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16) but also the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29; Col. 1:18; Heb. 1:6; Rev. 1:5). How could the only begotten Son become the firstborn Son? As the only begotten Son He must be the only Son and cannot be the first, and as the firstborn Son He is the first Son and thus cannot be the only Son. How should we explain this?<p>Theologians claim that the persons of the Trinity should not be confused. Nevertheless, we need to ask certain questions. Is Christ only the Son and not also the Spirit? Is the Spirit only the Spirit? Is the Spirit not also related to Christ and involved with the Son? Another question concerns the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6). According to Revelation 5:6 the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb. Are the seven Spirits and the Lamb one person or two persons? Surely They are two, yet the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb. Are They one or two? If we say that the Lamb and the seven Spirits as the seven eyes of the Lamb are one, others, insisting that the Spirit is the Spirit and the Son is the Son, will accuse us of confusing the persons of the Divine Trinity. But in Revelation 5:6 the third of the Divine Trinity is the eyes of the second. How, then, can the Spirit be separate from the Son? Are your eyes separate from you yourself? While your eyes are looking at someone, you are looking at that person. No one would say, &#8220;Only my eyes are looking at you; I myself am not looking at you.&#8221; Your eyes are you. For your eyes to look at something means that you yourself are looking. These are brief illustrations of the shortages of the theology in today&#8217;s Christianity.<p>Because the matters of the Son and the Spirit in the Divine Trinity are very difficult and complicated, we have been compelled to give Christ a particular title-the all-inclusive Christ. Christ is all-inclusive because He is everything. He is God, He is the Father (Isa. 9:6), He is the Son, and He is the Spirit. According to the revelation in the New Testament, the Father is embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9), and the Son is realized by the Spirit (John 14:17, 20). Thus, the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the realization of the Son. This surely is a divine and heavenly language.<p>John 1:1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; Since the Word was God what need was there for Him to be with God? No one can explain this adequately, for we do not have the language to express this kind of &#8220;culture.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>I. NOT ONE OF TODAY&#8217;S THEOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE NICENE CREED, STRESSING ADEQUATELY THE FOLLOWING FIVE CRITICAL POINTS CONCERNING THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN THE MOVE OF GOD&#8217;S ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Spirit That Gives Life Being Not Yet before the Glorification (Resurrection) of Christ</h2><p>The Spirit that gives life was not yet before the glorification (resurrection) of Christ (John 7:39b). John 7:37-39 says, &#8220;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&#8221; The historical background of the Lord&#8217;s word was related to the Feast of Tabernacles, the last and greatest of the Jewish annual feasts. The Feast of Tabernacles was a very pleasant feast. It was held at the time when the children of Israel came together to enjoy what they had harvested. They were happy together for a period of seven days. The last day was the great day of the feast. On that day, to the surprise of those attending the feast, the Lord Jesus stood up and cried out, saying, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.&#8221; This word is rich in meaning, for it indicates that those who were keeping the Feast of Tabernacles were still thirsty, having nothing to quench their thirst.<p>Both in the past and in the present, many great men, after becoming successful in their career or enterprise or after becoming renowned, felt that their life was still a vanity. Like King Solomon they could say, &#8220;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity....I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit&#8221; (Eccl. 1:2, 14). To have such a feeling is to be thirsty and unsatisfied. Realizing that the people had not been satisfied and their thirst had not been quenched, the Lord Jesus stood up and cried out on the great day of the feast, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.&#8221; What a great word this is! Only the Lord Jesus is qualified to speak such a word. Only He, a man a little over thirty years of age, could say, &#8220;He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&#8221;<p>In verse 39 the apostle John, the writer of the Gospel of John, gave the explanation, saying, &#8220;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&#8221; Here John speaks not of the Spirit of God, nor of the Spirit of Jehovah, nor of the Holy Spirit, but simply of the Spirit, telling us that &#8220;the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&#8221; His word indicates an expectation-the expectation that, although the Spirit was &#8220;not yet,&#8221; the time was coming when the Spirit would be there. This time was the time of Jesus&#8217; glorification, that is, the time of Jesus&#8217; resurrection (Luke 24:26). The Lord Jesus was the very God full of glory. However, He became flesh, and His divine glory was concealed within the shell of His flesh, the shell of His humanity. When He died this shell was broken, and when He resurrected the glory concealed within Him was released. From this we see that His resurrection was His glorification. Therefore, the expectation in John 7:39 was that when the Lord Jesus was glorified through resurrection, the Spirit who was &#8220;not yet&#8221; would become the Spirit who now is.<h2 class=head2>B. The Last Adam (Christ in the Flesh) Becoming a Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>The second critical point concerning the Spirit of God not adequately stressed in today&#8217;s theologies is that, as revealed in 1 Corinthians 15:45b, in resurrection the last Adam (Christ in the flesh) became a life-giving Spirit (fulfilling John 7:39). Hence, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that &#8220;the Lord is the Spirit,&#8221; and the following verse uses &#8220;the Lord Spirit&#8221; as a compound divine title. The word in 1 Corinthians 15:45b about the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit is a strong fulfillment of the prophecy in John 7:39 concerning the Spirit being not yet because Christ was not yet glorified, resurrected. In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit.<p>Many pastors, missionaries, theologians, and professors oppose us for teaching that, according to 1 Corinthians 15:45, Christ as the last Adam in the flesh became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection. Even two co-workers have opposed us in this matter. One of these co-workers, who eventually became an opponent, said that he did not believe that Christ the Son could become the life-giving Spirit. On one occasion this person told me that he believed that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were three Gods. When I heard him say this, I told him that he was teaching the heresy of tritheism. I went on to point out that the Bible tells us that God is uniquely one. The other co-worker was troubled by three hymns I had written on Christ as the Spirit (Hymns, #493, 539, and 745). He admitted that the Bible does say that Christ became the life-giving Spirit, but then he warned me that if we preach this, Christianity will reject us. I said, &#8220;Brother, I came to this country with the burden to preach and teach this. Since you agree that it is according to the Bible to say that Christ became the life-giving Spirit, please give me the liberty to teach this truth.&#8221;<p>The New Testament speaks of Christ&#8217;s two becomings. John 1:14 says that, as the Word, God became flesh, and 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that Christ, as the last Adam in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit. We should believe and teach both that God became the flesh and that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head2>C. The Compound Spirit Typified by the Anointing Ointment</h2><p>Third, not one of today&#8217;s theologies stresses adequately the critical point concerning the compound Spirit typified by the anointing ointment (a compound of one hin of olive oil with four kinds of spices and their effectiveness) in Exodus 30:23-25. The life-giving Spirit is not simple but is a Spirit that has been compounded. The last Adam was a man, and the life-giving Spirit is divine. Thus, this Spirit must be a Spirit with two natures-the human nature and the divine nature. These two natures have not only been mingled but have been compounded, as indicated by the type in Exodus 30:23-25, which records God&#8217;s instructions for forming the anointing ointment.<p>This ointment was not a single element but a compound. A single element cannot be an ointment. The anointing ointment in Exodus 30 was a compound of one main item-a hin of olive oil-compounded with four kinds of spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. In typology, oil signifies the Spirit of God. Flowing myrrh signifies Christ&#8217;s death, and cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of His death. Calamus, a reed that grows in a marsh or muddy place, shooting upward toward the sky, signifies resurrection. Cassia signifies the repelling power and effectiveness of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Cassia is a kind of bark that was used as a repellent to repel snakes and insects. Thus, cassia signifies the power, especially the repelling power, of Christ&#8217;s resurrection. His resurrection has the power to repel Satan, the serpent. These four spices were compounded with the one hin of olive oil to become one ointment of five elements.<p>With this compound ointment we have the number one (one hin of olive oil) signifying the one God and the number four (four spices) signifying man as God&#8217;s creature. We also have the number three, seen in the fact that the quantity of the spices involved three units, each of five hundred shekels: myrrh-five hundred shekels; cinnamon-two hundred fifty shekels; calamus-two hundred fifty shekels; and cassia-five hundred shekels. Hence, the amount of the spices consisted of three units of five hundred shekels, or five hundred shekels times three. The number three signifies the Triune God. Here we should note the second unit of five hundred shekels was split into two parts (typifying Christ, the middle of the Divine Trinity, who was wounded on the cross), each of two hundred fifty shekels. In the Bible two is the number of testimony. Furthermore, with this compound ointment we have the number five, formed by adding the one hin of olive oil and the four spices. The number five is seen also in the five hundred shekels. In the Bible five signifies responsibility. For example, the Ten Commandments were written on two tablets, with five commandments on each tablet. In Matthew 25 the ten virgins are divided into two groups consisting of the five wise ones and the five foolish ones. From all the foregoing we see that the numbers one, two, three, four, and five are all used in the type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30.<p>This Old Testament type, which actually was a kind of prophecy, must have a New Testament fulfillment. The type of the anointing ointment was completely fulfilled in the life-giving Spirit, which was produced in Christ&#8217;s resurrection. The life-giving Spirit, who the last Adam became, contains Christ&#8217;s divinity, His humanity, the sweetness and effectiveness of His death, and the power and effectiveness of His resurrection. The life-giving Spirit is therefore the compound Spirit typified by the anointing ointment in the Old Testament.<h2 class=head2>D. The Spirit of Life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ Himself, and the Indwelling Spirit All Referring to the Compound Spirit That Gives Life</h2><p>Christ is Christ, and He is also the Spirit, for He has been pneumatized and has become the pneumatic Christ. Concerning the pneumatic Christ, we need to see that the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ Himself, and the indwelling Spirit in Romans 8:2, 9-11 all refer to the compound Spirit that gives life. In verse 2 we have the Spirit of life, and in verses 9 to 11, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ Himself, and the indwelling Spirit. Are these five or are they one? The life-giving Spirit is called the Spirit of life, the Spirit of life is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Christ is just Christ Himself. Furthermore, this Spirit who is of life, of God, of Christ, and Christ Himself dwells in us as the indwelling Spirit to dispense life to us all the time. This is the pneumatic Christ.<p>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit,&#8221; and verse 18 says that we are transformed &#8220;from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; Like the title Father God, the title Lord Spirit is a compound divine title. He is the Lord, and He is also the Spirit. Today our Christ is the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ, the Christ who is both the Lord and the Spirit.<p>With the Spirit Himself there was no humanity. Likewise, the Spirit did not include the elements of the death of Christ, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of the resurrection of Christ. However, the element of Christ&#8217;s humanity and the elements of His death, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection have all been added to and compounded with the Spirit of God to produce the compound Spirit. Today the pneumatic Christ is such a consummated life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head2>E. The Seven Spirits of God</h2><p>The fifth critical point which today&#8217;s theologies do not stress adequately concerning the Spirit of God in the move of God&#8217;s eternal economy is the seven Spirits (the sevenfold intensified Spirit, cf. the sevenfold sunlight-Isa. 30:26) of God (Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6).<p>As the last Adam in the flesh, Christ could be our Redeemer, but He could not enter into us to impart Himself to us as life. But after He became the Spirit, He was able to enter into us as the Spirit of life to save us organically, carrying out His organic salvation within us as the Spirit that gives life. In particular, He is the life-giving Spirit to produce the church. However, not long after the church was produced, it became degraded. Revelation, the last book of the Bible, speaks of the degradation of the church. Because of this degradation, the life-giving Spirit, who is both Christ and the Spirit, became intensified sevenfold.<p>Isaiah 30:26, a prophecy related to the millennium, says, &#8220;The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold.&#8221; Whereas in Isaiah we have the sevenfold sunlight, in Revelation we have the sevenfold Spirit. For producing the church the life-giving Spirit is sufficiently strong, but under the degradation of the church this strong Spirit has been intensified sevenfold. Thus, Christ has become not only the life-giving Spirit but also the sevenfold intensified Spirit. The seven Spirits being the seven eyes of the Lamb (Rev. 5:6) indicates that the seven Spirits and Christ are one person.<h2 class=head1>II. BEING HELD BACK BY IMPERFECT AND UNSCRIPTURAL THEOLOGY FROM THE CENTRAL REVELATION OF GOD AND COMING SHORT OF THE COMPLETION OF GOD&#8217;S ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2><p>The Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, the Brethren assemblies, the Pentecostal churches, and all the free groups are held back by their imperfect and unscriptural theology from the central revelation of God and come short of the completion of God&#8217;s eternal economy because of their missing, negligence of, and opposition to the above five critical points concerning the Spirit of God.<p>We all need to have a clear view of the central revelation of God. The central revelation of God is God becoming flesh, the flesh becoming the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit becoming intensified sevenfold to build up the church to issue in the Body of Christ and to consummate the New Jerusalem. We need to see that the Triune God became flesh, that the flesh became the life-giving Spirit, and that the life-giving Spirit became the sevenfold intensified Spirit. This Spirit is to build up the church, which becomes the Body of Christ consummating the New Jerusalem as the final goal of God&#8217;s economy. This central revelation has been altogether neglected in today&#8217;s theologies. The Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, the Brethren assemblies, the Pentecostal churches, and all the free groups come short of the completion of God&#8217;s eternal economy because of their missing, negligence of, and opposition to the five critical points concerning the Spirit of God which we have covered in this message. The Lord&#8217;s recovery today is just the recovery of these critical points concerning the Spirit of God in the move of God&#8217;s eternal economy.<p>I am quite concerned for all the co-workers and elders. It may be that a good number of them do not have a complete understanding of what the Lord&#8217;s recovery is. If we are asked to explain what the recovery is today, we should be able to answer in one simple sentence: The Lord&#8217;s recovery is God becoming the flesh, the flesh becoming the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit becoming the sevenfold intensified Spirit to build up the church that becomes the Body of Christ and that consummates the New Jerusalem. Regarding the Lord&#8217;s present recovery, I hope that none of you would be held back by your old theology or by your old understanding of the recovery.<h2 class=head1>III. GOD HAVING A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THE GOD-MEN TO BE HIS OVERCOMERS</h2><p>God must have a people who are the God-men to be His overcomers for Him to accomplish His eternal economy concerning the church issuing in the Body of Christ and consummating the New Jerusalem.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>TO ENTER INTO THE MYSTICAL REALM OF CHRIST&#8217;S HEAVENLY MINISTRY</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Passing through the physical realm of Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>In the physical realm of His earthly ministry, Christ is the Christ in the flesh:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>For thirty-three and a half years, from His incarnation to become the flesh to His all- inclusive death.</li>		<li>In His flesh (Col. 1:22) Christ carried out His earthly ministry by accomplishing God&#8217;s judicial redemption, resulting objectively in God&#8217;s:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Forgiveness of the believers&#8217; sins-Eph. 1:7.</li>			<li>Washing away the believers&#8217; sins-Heb. 1:3.</li>			<li>Justifying the believers-Rom. 3:24.</li>			<li>Reconciling the believers as His enemies to Himself-Rom. 5:10a.</li>			<li>Sanctifying the believers in their position unto Himself as His holy people-Heb. 13:12; 10:29.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>As a procedure of the complete salvation of God for the believers to participate in God&#8217;s organic salvation as the purpose of the complete salvation of God.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>One who has experienced God&#8217;s judicial redemption may be considered saved by being redeemed only, but he still needs to be saved more by God&#8217;s organic salvation in the accomplishing of God&#8217;s economy.</li>	</ol></li><li>To enter into the mystical realm of Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>In the mystical realm of His heavenly ministry, Christ is the Christ as the life-giving Spirit:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>From His resurrection in which He became the life-giving Spirit through eternity.</li>		<li>As the life-giving Spirit (Rom. 8:9-10; 2 Cor. 3:17-18), Christ is carrying out His heavenly ministry by accomplishing God&#8217;s organic salvation subjectively in eight steps:			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Regeneration-to generate the redeemed believers with His divine life that they may be born of God to be His children of His species-John 1:12-13; 3:6b.</li>			<li>Feeding-to feed the newborn babes by regeneration in His shepherding His flock by nourishing and cherishing (Eph. 5:29) that His sheep may grow in the divine life unto maturity-John 10:10-11, 14-16; 21:15-17; Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 5:4; 2:25.</li>			<li>Dispositional sanctification-to sanctify the believers who are growing in the divine life in their disposition with the holy nature of God-Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22; 1 Thes. 5:23.</li>			<li>Renewing-to have their mind changed in their religion, logic, and philosophy concerning the universe, mankind, God, etc., by the Spirit of truth with the revelations of the Scriptures, even to have Christ&#8217;s mind replacing their mind through the consuming work of the cross-Titus 3:5; Rom. 12:2b; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 8:6; Phil. 2:5; 2 Cor. 4:16.</li>			<li>Transformation-to be transformed not only in the nature within but much more in the outward form for expression.

We thank You, Lord, that You have chosen us and have even appointed us with a commission to carry out Your eternal economy. Oh, what a career! By ourselves we are absolutely not qualified, but You have commissioned us. What shall we say? We just look unto You. Lord, open Your heart to us again and unveil what is hidden in the depths of Your good pleasure. Lord, we like to be open to You. We do not want to have anything covering us. Lord, we ask You to take away all the veils, all the logic, theologies, philosophies, and traditional teachings. Lord, remove layer after layer of veils from us. Lord, we long to be released, to be freed, from all these bondages. We do not want to be held back or to be short in carrying out Your economy. Thank You, Lord, for treating us as Your loving followers. We believe that You are here, sitting with us, wanting to have an intimate, face-to-face talk about Your career, according to Your eternal economy. Lord, speak to us. We ask that we may hear Your voice and see Your vision. Amen, Lord.<p>The title of this message is &#8220;To Enter into the Mystical Realm of Christ&#8217;s Heavenly Ministry.&#8221; Here the word realm is of great significance. Instead of realm we may use the word kingdom and thus speak of the mystical kingdom of Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry. If we would enter into the realm of Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry, a realm which is altogether mystical, we need to know the mystical Christ.<p>In His person Christ is mystical. Concerning Christ&#8217;s incarnation, there are two kinds of records in the New Testament-a physical record and a mystical record. In the synoptic Gospels, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the record of the Lord&#8217;s incarnation is altogether physical. We are told that He was born of a virgin, that He was laid in a manger, that shepherds came to worship Him, that He was taken from Israel to Egypt, and that He grew up in Nazareth. All this is a physical record. The record in the Gospel of John is absolutely different. Chapter one, for instance, is not a physical record but a mystical record. Verses 1 and 14 say, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&#8221; This way of speaking about the incarnation is mystical and mysterious. &#8220;Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace&#8221; (v. 16). This also is mystical. John&#8217;s account of Christ&#8217;s incarnation is altogether mystical.<p>Actually, the entire Gospel of John is mystical. &#8220;All things came into being through Him [the Word]....In Him was life, and the life was the light of men&#8221; (1:3, 4). This is mystical. This One is &#8220;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world,&#8221; and upon Him the Spirit descended &#8220;as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him&#8221; (vv. 29, 32). This, too, is mystical. Those who believe into Him become stones (v. 42). Speaking of Himself as the heavenly ladder, Christ said, &#8220;You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man&#8221; (v. 51). To be sure, all these things are mystical. Christ&#8217;s being the temple as the house of God (2:16-21) is mystical, and regeneration also is mystical. &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221; (3:6b). The issue of regeneration is to produce a bride, who is the increase of the Bridegroom (vv. 29-30). Once again, this is a mystical matter. &#8220;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up&#8221; (v. 14). Christ&#8217;s hanging on the cross as a brass serpent is surely mystical. In 4:10 and 14 Christ tells us that if we drink of the living water which He alone can give us, this water will become in us &#8220;a spring of water gushing up into eternal life.&#8221; Then He goes on to say, &#8220;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness&#8221; (v. 24). All this is mystical.<p>All the saints in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, especially the co-workers and the elders, need to have a clear view concerning the physical realm and the mystical realm. The co-workers and the elders, who take the lead in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, must realize that the Lord&#8217;s recovery is resting upon their shoulders. What the recovery will be depends upon what they will be. I am heavily burdened about this. Since this is my burden, I cannot give you ordinary teachings. Instead, I must present something particular. You need to know this age and to realize that it is an age of ignorance, a time when Christians are being blinded and held back by traditional theology. Therefore, I am burdened to tell you that you need to enter into a realm, a sphere, a kingdom, which is much higher than the realm you are in now. This higher realm is the mystical realm of Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head1>I. PASSING THROUGH THE PHYSICAL REALM OF CHRIST&#8217;S EARTHLY MINISTRY</h2><p>First, we must pass through the physical realm of Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry. To be sure, what is physical is also earthly. We should not linger in this realm but should pass through it quickly, like those who are taking an express train.<h2 class=head2>A. In the Physical Realm of His Earthly Ministry, Christ Being the Christ in the Flesh</h2><p>Have you ever heard that when Christ was on earth, He was the Christ in the flesh? In the Bible flesh is a very negative word. According to Genesis 6:3, when man fell to such an extent that he had become flesh, God decided to destroy man from the face of the earth. Nevertheless, John 1:14 says not that the Word became a man nor that the Word became a person but that the Word became flesh. Because flesh is something condemned by God, many Christians do not have the boldness to teach that Christ was flesh. Some may say that God became a man, but the Bible says that God became flesh. In Romans 8:3 Paul tells us that the Son of God came &#8220;in the likeness of the flesh of sin.&#8221; Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the nature of sin, just as the brass serpent had the form of a serpent but not the poisonous nature of a serpent (John 3:14; Num. 21:4-9). The New Testament clearly reveals that Christ was flesh, yet without sin; He never sinned (Heb. 2:14; 4:15). We are told even that God made Christ sin for us: &#8220;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf&#8221; (2 Cor. 5:21). This is the genuine, clear, and pure revelation of the Word of God.<h2 class=head3>1. From His Incarnation to Become the Flesh to His All-inclusive Death</h2><p>Christ was in the flesh for thirty-three and a half years, from His incarnation to become the flesh to His all-inclusive death.<h2 class=head3>2. In His Flesh Christ Carrying Out His Earthly Ministry by Accomplishing God&#8217;s Judicial Redemption</h2><p>In His flesh (Col. 1:22) Christ carried out His earthly ministry by accomplishing God&#8217;s judicial redemption. This redemption resulted objectively in God&#8217;s forgiveness of the believers&#8217; sins (Eph. 1:7), washing away the believers&#8217; sins (Heb. 1:3), justifying the believers (Rom. 3:24), reconciling the believers as His enemies to Himself (Rom. 5:10a), and sanctifying the believers in their position unto Himself as His holy people (Heb. 13:12; 10:29). All these matters are very good, but they are physical, earthly, judicial, and objective.<h2 class=head3>3. As a Procedure of the Complete Salvation of God</h2><p>What Christ carried out in His earthly ministry was a procedure of the complete salvation of God for the believers to participate in God&#8217;s organic salvation as the purpose of the complete salvation of God. This procedure can be compared to an escalator which brings us from one level to another. An escalator is useful, but one should not stay on an escalator for a long time. However, most of today&#8217;s Christians are lingering on the &#8220;escalator&#8221; of the procedure of the complete salvation of God. Some are not even on the escalator but are still on the &#8220;ground floor&#8221;; they have not yet begun to experience the procedure.<p>It is extremely important that we differentiate between the procedure of God&#8217;s complete salvation and the purpose of His complete salvation. The procedure is judicial, and the purpose is organic. Furthermore, the procedure is in the physical realm, and the purpose is in the mystical realm.<h2 class=head2>B. One Who Has Experienced God&#8217;s Judicial Redemption Being Considered Saved</h2><p>One who has experienced God&#8217;s judicial redemption may be considered saved by being redeemed only, but he still needs to be saved more by God&#8217;s organic salvation in the accomplishing of God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head1>II. TO ENTER INTO THE MYSTICAL REALM OF CHRIST&#8217;S HEAVENLY MINISTRY</h2><p>We need to pass through the physical realm of Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry and enter into something higher-the mystical realm of Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head2>A. In the Mystical Realm of His Heavenly Ministry, Christ Being the Christ as the Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s being the life-giving Spirit is a most important qualification for Christ to carry out His heavenly ministry. When He was in the flesh, He was not able to enter into us as life. As a young Christian I was bothered when I heard that, according to the Bible, Christ is in us. I wondered how it was possible for Christ to be in me. At that time, I did not realize that, in and through resurrection, the Christ who was in the flesh became the life-giving Spirit. Later I came to see that the New Testament unveils the fact that the One who died on the cross as our Savior was resurrected, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Now He is qualified to carry out His heavenly ministry in the mystical realm.<h2 class=head3>1. From His Resurrection through Eternity</h2><p>In the mystical realm of His heavenly ministry, Christ is the life-giving Spirit from His resurrection, in which He became the life-giving Spirit, through eternity.<h2 class=head3>2. Accomplishing God&#8217;s Organic Salvation Subjectively in Eight Steps</h2><p>As the life-giving Spirit (Rom. 8:9-10; 2 Cor. 3:17-18), Christ is carrying out His heavenly ministry by accomplishing God&#8217;s organic salvation subjectively in eight steps. Here we can see a sharp contrast: earthly versus heavenly, physical versus mystical, judicial versus organic, and objective versus subjective. All eight aspects of God&#8217;s organic salvation are subjective.<h2 class=head4>a. Regeneration</h2><p>Regeneration is to generate the redeemed believers with the divine life that they may be born of God to be His children of His species (John 1:12-13; 3:6b). As God&#8217;s children we are of His kind, His species. Therefore, we are gods, having God&#8217;s life and nature but not His Godhead.<h2 class=head4>b. Feeding</h2><p>Feeding is to feed the newborn babes by regeneration in Christ&#8217;s shepherding His flock by nourishing and cherishing (Eph. 5:29) that His sheep may grow in the divine life unto maturity (John 10:10-11, 14-16; 21:15-17; Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 5:4; 2:25). Feeding surely is organic.<h2 class=head4>c. Dispositional Sanctification</h2><p>Dispositional sanctification is to sanctify the believers who are growing in the divine life in their disposition with the holy nature of God (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22; 1 Thes. 5:23). Our natural disposition is crooked, perverted, and distorted, yet it can be sanctified and corrected, not with teaching but with the holy nature of God.<h2 class=head4>d. Renewing</h2><p>Renewing is to have our mind changed in our religion, logic, and philosophy concerning the universe, mankind, God, etc., by the Spirit of truth with the revelations of the Scriptures, even to have Christ&#8217;s mind replacing our mind through the consuming work of the cross (Titus 3:5; Rom. 12:2b; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 8:6; Phil. 2:5; 2 Cor. 4:16).<p>The missionaries who came to China talked a lot about love, telling us that we had to love others. After I was saved, I gradually became enlightened to see that all Christian virtues, including love, are different from the natural human virtues. Every Christian virtue must have a fourfold qualification: It must be through the cross, it must be by the Spirit, it must be for ministering Christ, and it must be for the producing of the church. The love taught in the New Testament is a love that is through the cross, which cuts off the self, it is by the Spirit, and it ministers Christ for the producing of the church. After I became clear regarding this, I realized that the missionaries were mistaken in their teaching, for they taught wrongly about love while claiming that their teaching was according to the Bible. The love unveiled in the Bible is not a natural human love (to love men without selfishness) like that taught by Confucius.<p>The principle is the same with submission. A sister&#8217;s submission to her husband must be a submission that is through the cross, that is by the Spirit, that ministers, or dispenses, Christ, and that is for the producing and building up of the church. This kind of submission is altogether different from the submission taught by Confucius. His kind of submission is by the natural life, having nothing to do with the cross, the Spirit, and the dispensing of Christ and not having the goal of producing the church.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that all the virtues taught by the Bible are through the cross, by the Spirit, and minister Christ for the producing of the churches for the building up of the Body. Concerning this matter our mind needs to be renewed.<h2 class=head4>e. Transformation</h2><p>Transformation is the issue of renewing (Rom. 12:2). It is to be transformed not only in the nature within but much more in the outward form for expression. It is not a correction nor merely an outward change; it is an inward metabolism by having more of the element of the divine life added to the believers for the outward expression (Rom. 12:2b; 2 Cor. 3:18). Remember that transformation is not only an outward change but is a metabolic change through the addition of the divine life, which transforms us into the image of Christ.<h2 class=head4>f. Building Up</h2><p>Building up is a matter of the believers&#8217; growth in the divine life and their being joined together with other believers in the divine life (Eph. 4:15-16). Renewing issues in transformation, and transformation issues in building up. This is fully proven by the wall with its foundations of the New Jerusalem. The wall of the New Jerusalem is of jasper, expressing the appearance of God (Rev. 4:3). While the jasper stones were being transformed, they were joined together and built up into a wall.<p>We should not think that to be built up is only to be closely related to other believers in a natural way. This is not the way to be built up. The proper way to be built up is to grow together in the divine life. While we are growing, this growth joins us all together as one.<h2 class=head4>g. Conformation</h2><p>Conformation is to be conformed to the full-grown image of the firstborn Son of God, who is the first God-man, as the prototype for mass reproduction. He is God mingled with man and man mingled with God to live a God-man living that expresses all the attributes of God as human virtues for the expression of the divine glory in humanity, whose ultimate consummation, whose maturity in the divine life, is the New Jerusalem (Rom. 8:29; 1:4; Eph. 4:14; Rev. 21).<h2 class=head4>h. Glorification</h2><p>Glorification is to be saturated with the divine glory from within in the maturity of the divine life and to be glorified from without by and with the divine glory as the finalization of God&#8217;s judicial redemption of the believers&#8217; body and the top portion of the divine sonship in God&#8217;s organic salvation (Rom. 8:30; Heb. 2:10; Phil. 3:21; Eph. 4:30; Rom. 8:23).<p>Ephesians 4:30 says that we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit &#8220;unto the day of redemption.&#8221; Redemption here refers to the redemption of our body. The Holy Spirit as the seal in us is sealing us continually with the element of God until our body is redeemed, that is, transfigured and glorified. This means that glorification is a matter of saturation. We may liken the Holy Spirit to ink that permeates and saturates the pages of a book. We all have been &#8220;inked&#8221; by the Holy Spirit, and year after year and day after day His &#8220;inking,&#8221; His dispensing of the divine life, is gradually saturating us until we are glorified. We have been &#8220;inked&#8221; by the Holy Spirit, who is God&#8217;s glory. We have therefore been &#8220;inked&#8221; by God&#8217;s glory, and the &#8220;inking&#8221; of God&#8217;s glory is causing His glory to permeate us until it saturates our entire being. If we see this, we will realize that glorification is not merely objective but very subjective.<p>The time of full saturation will be the time of the redemption of our body. We have been regenerated in our spirit and we now are being transformed in our soul, but our body is still the old creation. For this reason our old body needs to be redeemed. The last stage of redemption, the redemption of our body, will be the top portion of our sonship.<p>If we do not properly control our body according to the divine attributes expressed through the human virtues, our body becomes an ugly thing. As an elderly person I am quite weak in my body, and this bodily weakness troubles me. I can still move and work, but daily I am suffering because of my physical weakness. Inwardly I say, &#8220;Lord Jesus, one day I will be glorified. Then I will be delivered from this old body, which does not have any share in the divine sonship.&#8221;<p>The sonship is of the Spirit, and the Spirit is saturating us with the sonship until our body is saturated with the sonship. Then we will experience the full sonship, the full &#8220;sonizing,&#8221; the redemption of our body. We still have a part-our physical body-which has not been &#8220;sonized,&#8221; so we are waiting for the day when even our body will become part of the divine sonship.<h2 class=head2>B. Being Reminded That Christ Accomplishes God&#8217;s Organic Salvation by Himself as the Spirit</h2><p>We must be reminded all the time that Christ accomplishes God&#8217;s organic salvation not by Himself as the Christ in the flesh but by Himself as the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head2>C. Remembering That All the Items of God&#8217;s Organic Salvation Are Carried Out by Christ&#8217;s Heavenly Ministry</h2><p>We also have to remember that all the items of God&#8217;s organic salvation are carried out not by Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry judicially and objectively but by His heavenly ministry organically and subjectively. There is a great difference between Christ&#8217;s earthly ministry and His heavenly ministry. Today we are not being saved judicially and objectively by the earthly ministry of Christ in the flesh. We are being saved organically and subjectively through the heavenly ministry of the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit. To experience this organic salvation, we all need to enter into the mystical realm of Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE DIVINE AND MYSTICAL REALM OF THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT AND THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 14:10-11; Phil. 1:19; Rom. 8:9; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; John 14:16-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 20:22; 16:12-15; 15:4-5, 8; 17:21, 23</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The divine and mystical realm:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son-John 14:10-11.</li>	<li>This indicates that the Father is embodied in the Son and the Son is the Father&#8217;s embodiment, forming a divine and mystical realm.</li>	</ol></li><li>The divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ-Phil. 1:19; Rom. 8:9; 2 Cor. 3:17-18:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, to be the reality of the Son realized as the Son&#8217;s presence in the believers-John 14:16-18.</li>	<li>In the day of the Son&#8217;s resurrection in which the Son became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), He came to the disciples in the night of that day to breathe into them and asked them to receive the Holy Spirit (John 20:22).

We are so blessed. Thank You. Lord, now we come to You to learn how You, the Triune God, are a realm and to see that You want us to enter into this realm, that is, to enter into You. Lord, open our eyes. Take away our disability and make us able to know the mystical things as You know them. O Lord, cover us, cleanse us, and anoint us. Lord, grant that we will sense Your presence and know that You are here speaking to us. May we all hear Your voice. Lord, You are so merciful. We are worthy of nothing. We are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing. But we have You as our everything. Amen.<p>In this message we come to a high peak-the divine and the mystical realm. Something that is mystical is not only spiritual but is also mysterious.<h2 class=head1>I. THE DIVINE AND MYSTICAL REALM</h2><p>The Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is self-existing, ever-existing, and coinhering, with the three of the Divine Trinity dwelling in one another. According to John 14:10 and 11 the Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son. This indicates that the Father is embodied in the Son and the Son is the Father&#8217;s embodiment, forming a divine and mystical realm, the realm of the Triune God. Therefore, the Triune God Himself is a divine and mystical realm.<p>The divine and mystical realm into which we may enter today is actually not simply the divine and mystical realm of the Triune God but the divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ. The terms consummated Spirit and pneumatic Christ are very particular.<p>Who is the consummated Spirit? The consummated Spirit is the compound Spirit typified by the anointing ointment-a compound of one hin of olive oil with four kinds of spices and their effectiveness (Exo. 30:23-25). Before the Spirit was consummated, He was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit. He participated in God&#8217;s creation only as the Spirit of God (Gen. 1:2). Much later, when the Israelites, God&#8217;s chosen people, were in trouble, God came down to help them as the Spirit of Jehovah (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:25). The Spirit of Jehovah was God coming near to His people in order to help them in an objective way but not in a subjective way.<p>The Old Testament is a record mainly of two things: God&#8217;s creation and the history of Israel, God&#8217;s chosen people. Because the history of Israel was miserable, they were constantly in need of God&#8217;s help. Without His coming to help His chosen people in their troubles, they would not have survived. In God&#8217;s creation the Spirit was the Spirit of God, and in God&#8217;s helping Israel the Spirit was the Spirit of Jehovah.<p>Through incarnation God became a man. God&#8217;s becoming a man was something altogether new, and for this new thing a particular title is used for the Spirit of God-the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35). In Greek the Holy Spirit is frequently called &#8220;the Spirit the Holy&#8221; (Luke 2:26; 3:22; 10:21; John 14:26). The title the Holy Spirit was used with respect to the incarnation because the incarnation was something utterly holy. God&#8217;s coming to be a man was a most holy matter, and Luke 1:35 even uses the expression the holy thing. As the conception of the God-man was of the Holy Spirit, so what was born of that conception was a holy thing. The Spirit who carried this out was not only the Spirit of God nor only the Spirit of Jehovah but the Holy Spirit. In the Bible, therefore, the Spirit is called the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit.<p>In John 7 we see that the Lord Jesus, the God-man, attended the Feast of Tabernacles. On the last day of the feast, the great day, He stood and cried out, saying, &#8220;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&#8221; (vv. 37-38). In the next verse John, the author of this Gospel, gives a word of explanation: &#8220;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified&#8221; (v. 39). We need to pay special attention to the words the Spirit was not yet. The Spirit of God was there from the beginning, in creation; the Spirit of Jehovah had come again and again to help the people of Israel in their troubles; and the Holy Spirit had been active in the incarnation. How could John say that the Spirit was &#8220;not yet&#8221;? Yes, the Spirit was there as the Spirit of God in Genesis, as the Spirit of Jehovah in Judges, and as the Holy Spirit in Matthew and Luke, but the Spirit-the Spirit as the compounded and consummated Spirit-was &#8220;not yet&#8221; in John 7:39 because at that time Jesus had not yet been glorified. The man Jesus was glorified in resurrection (Luke 24:26). Thus, the Spirit was &#8220;not yet&#8221; until Christ&#8217;s resurrection. In resurrection Christ, the last Adam in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit that gives life (1 Cor. 15:45b).<p>Now we can see something concerning the history of the consummation of the Spirit. Although the Spirit already was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit, the Spirit that gives life was &#8220;not yet&#8221; in John 7 because the Lord Jesus had not yet passed through death for man&#8217;s sin and had not yet entered into resurrection. On the contrary, at the time of John 7 He was still in the flesh and could not enter into people to be their life. But in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, and now He can come into the believers to impart life to them.<p>In resurrection the Spirit of God was mingled with Christ&#8217;s humanity, with His death and its effectiveness, and with His resurrection and its power. The issue of this mingling is the compound, consummated Spirit.<p>The Bible unveils the fact that the Spirit has become the consummated Spirit. Because many Christians have not seen the revelation in the Bible concerning the consummated Spirit, they need to be reeducated. Some may say, &#8220;God is the same from eternity; He has never had any change.&#8221; However, the Bible clearly reveals that God, who is Spirit, became flesh (John 1:14). Was that not a change? Furthermore, the last Adam in the flesh became the life-giving Spirit. Was that not also a change? First, God changed in that, through incarnation, He became flesh, and then He changed again in that, in resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the consummated Spirit. I hope that those who are under the influence of old, traditional theology will be willing to learn what the Bible, our highest authority, reveals concerning the consummated Spirit.<p>The Bible reveals also that Christ has become the pneumatic Christ. In eternity Christ was God as the Spirit, but then He became flesh. Romans 1:3 and 4 say that He &#8220;came out of the seed of David according to the flesh&#8221; but that He &#8220;was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.&#8221; The title the Spirit of holiness refers to Christ&#8217;s divinity, His divine essence. First Peter 3:18, speaking of Christ&#8217;s crucifixion, says that He was, on the one hand, &#8220;put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit.&#8221; The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh, not in His Spirit as His divinity. His Spirit as His divinity did not die at the cross when His flesh died; rather, His Spirit as His divinity was made alive, enlivened with new power of life. Thus, while He was dying in His humanity and even after He was buried, His Spirit as His divinity remained active.<p>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus referred to Himself as a grain of wheat: &#8220;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&#8221; When He fell into the earth as a grain of wheat, death began immediately. But as His &#8220;shell&#8221; was dying, the divine life within Him was growing. From this we see that while the Lord Jesus was dying, He was also growing. Without this kind of action, He could not have been resurrected.<p>Jesus&#8217; flesh was crucified and buried. How could it be resurrected? In John 20 Peter and John came to the tomb in which the Lord had been buried. Peter &#8220;entered into the tomb; and he beheld the linen cloths lying there and the handkerchief which had been over His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in one place apart&#8221; (vv. 6-7). The body surely had not been stolen. How, then, was it possible for the Lord&#8217;s dead and buried flesh to be resurrected? The answer to this question is that according to His flesh He had been buried there, but according to His divinity He had remained very active. Between the time of His burial and resurrection, His Spirit as His divinity was working to resurrect His humanity, to uplift it, and to bring it into divinity so that His humanity could be born of God. According to Acts 13:33 it was in resurrection that God begot Jesus to be the Son of God. He was therefore begotten to be the firstborn Son of God by having His humanity uplifted into divinity and even brought into the divine sonship. Simultaneously, He became the life-giving Spirit and thereby became the pneumatic Christ.<p>We have seen that the Spirit has been consummated and that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. Thus, we may now speak of the divine and mystical realm of this consummated Spirit and of this pneumatic Christ. What a marvelous realm this is!<p>We have pointed out that the three of the Divine Trinity are self-existing, ever-existing, and coinhering, and as such the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are a divine and mystical realm. With the Triune God Himself as a mystical realm there are no &#8220;complications,&#8221; but in the divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ there are a number of &#8220;complications,&#8221; all of which are blessings to us.<p>God wanted us to be in Him. If He were merely the Triune God without Christ&#8217;s humanity, death, and resurrection, and we could enter into Him, we would find the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but nothing of humanity, death, and resurrection. However, when we enter into the divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ, we have not only divinity but also the humanity of Christ, the death of Christ with its effectiveness, and the resurrection of Christ with its repelling power. Everything is here in this wonderful realm.<p>Although I was born in China and have become a naturalized American citizen, I can testify that I do not have the feeling that I am either Chinese or American. My realm is not China or America-my realm is the complicated and complicating Triune God. I am here with the Father, with the Son, who was crucified and resurrected, and with the consummated Spirit. Since I am in such a Triune God, I have whatever I need. If I need crucifixion, I find that in this realm I have been crucified already. If I need resurrection, in this realm I have been resurrected already. Praise the Lord for such a divine and mystical realm!<p>At this juncture, let us consider what is revealed in John 14 concerning the divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ. Verse 1 says, &#8220;Do not let your heart be troubled.&#8221; In what realm are we troubled? We are troubled on earth, in the world (16:33), in the physical realm.<p>In this verse (14:1) the Lord Jesus went on to say, &#8220;Believe into God, believe also into Me.&#8221; Here the preposition into is very important. We should believe not only in God and in Christ, but we should believe into God and into Christ. Our heart is troubled because we are in the world, and the way for this trouble to be solved is for us to enter into Christ by believing into Him. Here we can see two realms: the physical realm-the world where all the troubles are-and the mystical realm of the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, where peace is.<p>In 16:33 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world.&#8221; Here again we see both the physical realm (&#8220;the world&#8221;) and the mystical realm (&#8220;Me&#8221;).<p>Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of John are a section. At the beginning of this section the Lord Jesus indicated, in 14:1, that He intended to speak something to help us to believe into Him. We should not think that believing into Christ is a simple matter. If He had not died on the cross to take away our sins, to crucify our flesh, and to terminate our old man, and if He had not resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, there would be no way for Him to come into us and to bring us into Him.<p>If we had been there when the Lord Jesus spoke about believing into God and into Him, we might have said, &#8220;Lord, I want to enter into You. Tell me how to believe into You.&#8221; As the following verses reveal, for us to enter into Him He had to die and be resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, that we may receive Him by believing into Him and calling, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8221;<p>Between 14:1 and 16:33 we have the Lord&#8217;s teaching concerning how to believe into Him. John 14:2a says, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes.&#8221; In 14:1 the Lord Jesus spoke about believing into God and into Him, but here He suddenly spoke about His Father&#8217;s house. The Father&#8217;s house is surely not a heavenly mansion, but something mystical. According to the interpretation in 2:16, 21, &#8220;My Father&#8217;s house&#8221; refers to the temple, the increase of Christ in His resurrection to be the church, His Body, as God&#8217;s dwelling place (1 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 2:21-22). At first the body of Christ was only His individual body. But through His death and resurrection, the body of Christ was increased to be His corporate Body, which is the church, the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15), the temple of God (Eph. 2:21). Have you ever realized that when you believed into God and into the Son, you entered into the church?<p>John 14:2 tells us that in the Father&#8217;s house are &#8220;many abodes.&#8221; These abodes are the believers, the members of the Body of Christ. Every believer is an abode, as affirmed in verse 23.<p>In the latter part of verse 2 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I go to prepare a place for you.&#8221; The words I go mean &#8220;I die.&#8221; By saying &#8220;I go&#8221; He was speaking about His death in a mystical way.<p>At this point I would remind you that the Gospel of John is a mystical book and that the entire record in John is a mystical record. To speak of the incarnation by saying &#8220;the Word became flesh&#8221; (1:14) is to speak in a mystical way. Likewise, to speak of living water becoming in us a spring of water gushing up into eternal life (4:10, 14) is also to speak in a mystical way. Because John is a mystical book, when we read it we need to understand it mystically.<p>In John 14:3 the Lord Jesus continued, &#8220;And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.&#8221; Here He spoke of both His going and His coming. &#8220;I am coming&#8221; is a present continual, indicating that when the Lord Jesus spoke these words He was already coming. While He was speaking, He was preparing to enter into resurrection. &#8220;I go&#8221; is to die and &#8220;I am coming&#8221; is to be resurrected. Before He died He knew that He would come back. Here His going and His coming, His death and resurrection, are referred to in a mystical way.<p>In this verse the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I...will receive you to Myself.&#8221; If we had been there, we might have said, &#8220;Lord, will You not receive me into the Father&#8217;s house? Why do You say that You will receive me to Yourself?&#8221; The answer to such a question is that the Father&#8217;s house is just Christ Himself.<p>Verse 3 ends with the words where I am you also may be. He is in the Father. Thus, for us to be where He is means that we also will be in the Father. This is related to our believing into the Father, the divine and mystical realm.<p>The Lord Jesus went on to say, &#8220;And where I am going you know the way&#8221; (v. 4). Then Thomas said, &#8220;Lord, we do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?&#8221; (v. 5). According to verse 6 Jesus said to him, &#8220;I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&#8221; Here the Lord did not say, &#8220;No one comes to the Father&#8217;s house&#8221;; He said, &#8220;No one comes to the Father.&#8221; To come to the Father is to come to the Father&#8217;s house, for the Father is the house. The phrase except through Me reveals that we can come to the Father as the house only through Christ as the way.<p>In the next verse the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.&#8221; When Philip heard this he said, &#8220;Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us&#8221; (v. 8). Verses 9 and 10 continue, &#8220;Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.&#8221; Here we see that the Son&#8217;s speaking was actually the Father&#8217;s speaking, the Father&#8217;s working by abiding in Him. This is altogether mystical.<p>We have emphasized the fact that the Triune God is a divine and mystical realm. As revealed in the first part of John 14, the Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son. In verses 16 through 18 we have a word not only concerning the Father and the Son but also concerning the Spirit: &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.&#8221; The first Comforter was Christ in the flesh, and the other Comforter is the Spirit of reality. The &#8220;He&#8221; who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the &#8220;I&#8221; who is the Lord Himself in verse 18. This means that the Christ who was in the flesh went through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. This is not merely spiritual-it is mystical. We cannot say that the Spirit of reality is spiritual and the Christ who was in the flesh was not spiritual, for when He was in the flesh Christ the Son was surely spiritual. What we need to see here is not something that is spiritual only but something mystical.<p>Verse 19 continues, &#8220;Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.&#8221; This refers to Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Because He lives in resurrection, we also live, for we were regenerated in His resurrection, as revealed in 1 Peter 1:3.<p>In John 14:20 the Lord Jesus spoke of &#8220;that day.&#8221; &#8220;That day&#8221; was the day of His resurrection (20:19), the day on which He became the pneumatized Christ, the pneumatic Christ. Hence, in that day actually means &#8220;in the resurrection day.&#8221;<p>Let us now read all of verse 20: &#8220;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; This refers to the divine and mystical realm where not only the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are but also where the believers are. Praise the Lord that, as believers in Christ, we are now in the divine, mystical realm of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ!<h2 class=head1>II. THE DIVINE AND MYSTICAL REALM OF THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT AND THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST</h2><p>We all need to enter into the divine and mystical realm, not of the Triune God, but of the consummated Spirit and the pneumatic Christ (Phil. 1:19; Rom. 8:9; 2 Cor. 3:17-18).<h2 class=head2>A. Another Comforter, the Spirit of Reality, to Be the Reality of the Son</h2><p>John 14:16-18 speaks of another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, to be the reality of the Son realized as the Son&#8217;s presence in the believers. The Spirit is the reality of the Son, and the Son&#8217;s presence in us is the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>B. The Son Being in the Father, the Believers Being in the Son, and the Son Being in the Believers</h2><p>In the day of the Son&#8217;s resurrection, in which the Son became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), He came to the disciples in the night of that day to breathe into them and asked them to receive the Holy Spirit (John 20:22). If He were not the Spirit, how could He ask the disciples upon whom He was breathing to receive the Spirit? By all this we can know that the Son is in the Father, that the believers are in the Son, and that the Son is in the believers (John 14:19-20).<h2 class=head1>III. BEFORE AND AFTER THAT DAY OF CHRIST&#8217;S RESURRECTION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Before That Day of Christ&#8217;s Resurrection</h2><p>Before that day of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, He had yet many things to unveil to His disciples. But His disciples could not bear them then (John 16:12) because they had not received the Spirit of Christ&#8217;s resurrection and had not entered into the divine and mystical realm.<h2 class=head2>B. After That Day of Christ&#8217;s Resurrection</h2><p>The Lord Jesus said that when the Spirit of reality came, He would guide the disciples, who would then be in the Spirit of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, into all the reality concerning God&#8217;s economy for the Body of Christ, who is the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit. The Spirit of reality would speak what He heard of Christ and would declare to the disciples in the twenty-two Epistles of the New Testament from Romans to Revelation (John 16:13).<h2 class=head1>IV. THE DIVINE TRANSITION FOR THE ETERNAL ECONOMY OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2><h2 class=head2>A. All That the Father Has Being the Son&#8217;s Possession</h2><p>All that the Father has is the Son&#8217;s possession, embodied in the Son.<h2 class=head2>B. All That the Son Possesses Being Realized by the Spirit</h2><p>All that the Son possesses is received by the Spirit, realized by the Spirit who became the life-giving Spirit in the resurrection of Christ for the realization of the pneumatic Christ.<h2 class=head2>C. The Spirit Receiving All That Christ Has and Declaring to the Disciples</h2><p>The Spirit receives all that Christ has and declares to the disciples (who were then in the reality of Christ&#8217;s resurrection and in the divine and mystical realm of the pneumatic Christ) for the producing of the assemblies which issue in the Body of Christ that consummates the New Jerusalem to express the all-inclusive Christ for His glorification in eternity (vv. 14-15). First, all the things were the Father&#8217;s. Then what the Father had became Christ&#8217;s possession. Following this, whatever Christ possesses is heard and received by the Spirit, who declares all these things to the believers. This is the divine transition for the eternal economy of the Divine Trinity.<h2 class=head1>V. THE BELIEVERS BEING IN THE DIVINE AND MYSTICAL REALM OF THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT FOR THE KEEPING OF ONENESS</h2><p>All the believers should be in this divine and mystical realm of the consummated Spirit to be mingled with the Triune God for the keeping of oneness.<h2 class=head2>A. The Believers Abiding in the Son</h2><p>All the believers should abide in the Son that the Son may abide in them that they may bear much fruit for the glorification (expression) of the Father (15:4-5, 8). In chapter fourteen the Lord prepared the places, the abodes. In chapter fifteen we need to abide in Him as our abode that He may abide in us as His abode.<h2 class=head2>B. All the Believers Being One</h2><p>All the believers should be one, even as the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father, that they also may be in both the Father and the Son. The Son is in the believers and the Father is in the Son, that the believers may be perfected into one (17:21, 23). Our oneness must be the same as the oneness among the three of the Triune God. Actually, the believers&#8217; oneness is the oneness of the Triune God. It is in the Triune God that we can be perfected to be one. The real oneness, therefore, is in the Triune God.<p>In John 14-16 the Lord Jesus presented a message to His disciples, and then in John 17 He prayed to the Father. In His concluding prayer He indicated that our oneness should be in the Triune God, with the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit. This oneness, which is the genuine oneness, is the mingling of the believers with the Triune God. To have such a oneness the believers must be in the Triune God as a divine and mystical realm. Here the Father is in the Son, the Son is in the believers, and the believers are in the Son, who is in the Father. This means that the believers are one with the Triune God in the divine and mystical realm of the pneumatic Christ and the consummated Spirit.<h2 class=head1>VI. CHRIST&#8217;S HEAVENLY MINISTRY BEING CARRIED OUT IN THIS MYSTICAL REALM</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry is carried out in this mystical realm, and God&#8217;s organic salvation is practically accomplished in this realm. If we are not in this realm, we cannot participate in Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry or enjoy God&#8217;s organic salvation.<h2 class=head1>VII. THE BELIEVERS NEEDING TO CONSIDER HIGHLY THE ENTRY INTO THIS REALM</h2><p>The believers must consider highly the entry into this realm, realizing that without Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, without Christ being the pneumatic Christ, without Christ being the Lord Spirit, and without Christ being the Christ in resurrection and not only in the flesh, there is absolutely no way for the believers to participate in, experience, and enjoy the organic section of God&#8217;s complete salvation in Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>&#8220;THE SPIRIT HIMSELF WITH OUR SPIRIT&#8221; THE KEY TO OPEN THE EIGHT SECTIONS OF THE ORGANIC SALVATION OF GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><p class=hbody>Note: God&#8217;s intention in His organic salvation is to join the believer&#8217;s spirit with His Spirit as one spirit-a mingled spirit-1 Cor. 6:17.<ol class="upper-roman"><li>To open the first section of regeneration:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Spirit of reality came to convict the sinners concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment (John 16:8-11), causing them to repent of their fallen condition and enter into the death and burial of Christ (Matt. 3:2, 5-6).</li>	<li>At this juncture the Spirit of reality germinates the repentant believers with the resurrection life of Christ to regenerate them, to beget them anew in their spirit-1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:3, 5.</li>	<li>This is &#8220;that which is born of the Spirit [of God] is spirit [of man]&#8221;-a spirit born of the Spirit-John 3:6.</li>	<li>Right away the Spirit of God with the spirit of the regenerated believers witnesses that they are the (spiritual) children of God-Rom. 8:16.</li>	</ol></li><li>To open the second section of feeding:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Lord wants the regenerated believers as newborn babes to feed on the (spiritual) milk of the word, which word is spirit and life (John 6:63), that they may grow in His life unto their daily salvation-1 Pet. 2:2.</li>	<li>As they grow up in the divine life, they have to feed on the solid food also, not only on the milk, by exercising their spirit to contact the Spirit of God&#8217;s word that they may receive the supply of life-Heb. 5:13-14; Matt. 4:4b.</li>	</ol></li><li>To open the third section of dispositional sanctification:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The regenerated and growing believers need to be sanctified by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:16) in their disposition with the element of the resurrection life of Christ which they received through the feeding so that their crooked, perverted, natural disposition full of peculiarities can be sanctified with the divine holy nature of God (2 Pet. 1:4) that they may be holy unto God (Eph. 1:4).</li>	<li>This dispositional sanctification by the Holy Spirit begins from our spirit through our soul unto our body so that our entire being can be wholly sanctified-1 Thes. 5:23.</li>	</ol></li><li>To open the fourth section of renewing:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Going along with the dispositional sanctification, the Lord renews us by His Spirit-Titus 3:5.</li>	<li>The renewing Spirit is mingled with our regenerated spirit as one mingled spirit to spread into our mind to renew our entire being as a member of the new man by putting off our old man, that is, by renouncing and denying our old self (Matt. 16:24), and by putting on the new man, that is, by applying what Christ has accomplished in creating the new man (Eph. 2:15), by living and magnifying Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19-21)-Eph. 4:22-24.</li>	<li>The Lord uses the environmental sufferings to consume, to kill, our outer man that our inner man may be renewed day by day-2 Cor. 4:16.</li>	<li>Since we the believers all will be the consummating part of the New Jerusalem, we have to be renewed to be as new as the New Jerusalem-Rev. 21:2.</li>	</ol></li><li>To open the fifth section of transformation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Transformation is by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2b). It is not any kind of outward correction, adjustment, but an inward metabolism by the addition of the element of the divine life of Christ into our being to be expressed outwardly in the image of Christ. It is then by the Lord Spirit (the pneumatic Christ) to transform us into the image of the glory of Christ-2 Cor. 3:18.</li>	<li>We have to live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25) and walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4b), that the divine life of Christ may regulate us to transform us into the image of the Lord in glory.</li>	</ol></li><li>To open the sixth section of building:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>First Corinthians 3:9 and 12 unveil to us that we are God&#8217;s building and we have to build with gold (signifying God the Father&#8217;s golden nature), silver (God the Son&#8217;s redeeming work), and precious stones (God the Spirit&#8217;s transforming work), not with wood (signifying the nature of the natural man), grass (the fallen man, the man of the flesh), and stubble (the work and living that issue from an earthen source). This indicates that the building of God in which we are participating must be by transformed items like gold, silver, and precious stones, not by our nature, our flesh, and things from the earthen source.</li>	<li>The building of God as the building of the church, the Body of Christ, being by the transformation of the Spirit is clearly signified by the jasper wall with its foundations of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:18-20). The jasper is a transformed precious stone and the wall of the New Jerusalem looks like one big piece of jasper, indicating that while the stones were under transformation, they were also built together. Hence, both the building and transformation are by the same transforming and building Spirit.</li>	<li>Paul&#8217;s writings unveil to us that the church, the Body of Christ, as the dwelling place of God is in our spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God-Eph. 2:22; Rom. 8:11.</li>	<li>Christ makes (builds) His home in our hearts through the strengthening of the Spirit of God into our inner man (our regenerated spirit) where Christ is (2 Tim. 4:22), unto the fullness (expression) of God-Eph. 3:16-19.</li>	<li>Based upon the fact that the Spirit of God dwells within the lover of Christ (John 14:17), God the Father and the Son come to the lover of Christ and make a mutual abode with him (v. 23).</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Lord, we can never forget what a mercy and what a grace that You are the Spirit, even the life-giving Spirit and the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Lord, You have created for us a human spirit, and in Your organic salvation the first thing You do is to regenerate our spirit. Eventually, Lord, You put Yourself as such a Spirit in our spirit and mingled with our spirit to make us one spirit. Oh, he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit! We can never forget all this. We worship You for this. Impress us and always remind us of our being one spirit with You. Do we live in our spirit with Your Spirit? Do we move in our spirit with Your Spirit? Lord, do we fellowship with You in our spirit with Your Spirit? Lord, remind us all the time. Lord, speak to us that we may receive further visions. Amen.<p>In this message we do not want to merely repeat the items of God&#8217;s organic salvation. Instead, we want to see that the key of God&#8217;s organic salvation is the Spirit Himself with our spirit. We should not forget that there is such a marvelous phrase in the Bible in Romans 8:16. Even after we enter into the New Jerusalem, I would like to see a banner there saying-&#8220;The Spirit Himself with our spirit.&#8221; The Spirit Himself with our spirit is doing one thing: witnessing that we are the children of God. Just to say the people of God is not too critical, but to say the children of God is so great.<p>The Spirit Himself is the witnessing One, and this Spirit is the Spirit of life, the Spirit who gives life, the Spirit who is the Spirit of Christ. This Spirit is also the pneumatic Christ and the indwelling Spirit. Our spirit was created by God but became dead through the fall. But later it was regenerated by God. Not only so, after regeneration the regenerating Spirit remains in our regenerated spirit and mingles Himself with our spirit to make the two one. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &#8220;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&#8221;<p>Not only are we God-men but also we are one with God, one spirit with God. The human spirit and the divine Spirit are not only joined and mingled but are also one spirit. The Spirit is life and the One who gives life. God is the Spirit and in His marvelous organic salvation, He has made us one spirit with Him. This is just a simple word in 1 Corinthians 6:17, but I never saw this truth until after I had studied the Bible for at least thirty years. One day I realized that I am one spirit with God. This is not a small thing. Regretfully, even in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, many of the elders and even the co-workers do not know their real status. Our real status is that we are one spirit with God. We have been saved to such a high level. What God is, we are.<p>When we realize our status, this will affect our living. When I speak with others in a joking way, I am inwardly rebuked for being so loose and light with no gravity. I am reminded about my status, and I have to confess to the Lord. Due to my divine status, I dare not be loose or light. I dare not joke. Even with my grandchildren I dare not speak lightly, because I am not merely their grandfather. I am a grandfather who has the same status as God.<p>According to 1 Corinthians 6:17 God&#8217;s intention in His organic salvation is to join the believer&#8217;s spirit with His Spirit as one spirit-a mingled spirit. Eventually, this is not just the mingled spirit but a spirit that is one spirit with God, that is the same as God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead. This is the key to open the eight sections of the organic salvation of God. If we do not have this key, the door is closed. When we have this key, the door is open and we can see all things concealed within.<h2 class=head1>I. TO OPEN THE FIRST SECTION OF REGENERATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Spirit of Reality Coming to Convict the Sinners</h2><p>The Spirit of reality came to convict the sinners concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment (John 16:8-11). Sin is related to Adam. Adam is the source of sin. Righteousness is related to Christ. Christ is our righteousness. The judgment must be Satan&#8217;s judgment. Here are Adam, the source of sin; Christ, the source of righteousness; and Satan, the one who should bear the judgment. In the whole universe God&#8217;s blame is not to anyone else but to him. The whole universe today is full of rebellion due to one archangel who is Satan, so judgment has to be his. Sin came from Adam, righteousness is given from Christ, and judgment goes to Satan. The Spirit of reality came to convict us of this, causing us to repent of our fallen condition and enter into the death and burial of Christ (Matt. 3:2, 5-6). This conviction brought us to the death and resurrection of Christ to receive Him and be regenerated.<h2 class=head2>B. The Spirit of Reality Germinating the Repentant Believers</h2><p>First, we are convicted that we were born of Adam in sin and that we should take Christ as our righteousness. If we do not, we will bear the judgment with Satan. This conviction brings us into the death and resurrection of Christ. At this juncture, the Spirit of reality germinates us, the repentant believers, with the resurrection life of Christ to regenerate us, to beget us anew in our spirit (1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:3, 5). We must take note of the two spirits here. The Spirit germinates our spirit. This is the key for us to understand regeneration.<h2 class=head2>C. A Spirit Born of the Spirit</h2><p>&#8220;That which is born of the Spirit [of God] is spirit [of man]&#8221;-a spirit born of the Spirit (John 3:6).<h2 class=head2>D. The Spirit Witnessing with Our Spirit</h2><p>Right away the Spirit of God with the spirit of the regenerated believers witnesses that they are the (spiritual) children of God (Rom. 8:16). The children of God are divine and spiritual. We should not say that they are mystical, because it is very clear and evident that they are children of God.<h2 class=head1>II. TO OPEN THE SECOND SECTION OF FEEDING</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Feeding on the Spiritual Milk of the Word</h2><p>The Lord wants the regenerated believers as newborn babes to feed on the (spiritual) milk of the word, which word is spirit and life (John 6:63), that they may grow in His life unto their daily salvation (1 Pet. 2:2). The first step of God&#8217;s organic salvation is regeneration. After regeneration the newborn babes need to feed on the milk of the holy Word. The holy Word is the Spirit, so that milk is the spiritual milk. This feeding is so that they may grow in life unto their daily salvation. Every day we need to be saved. This is because our attitude, the tone of our voice, and our spirit are not so right. Even the way we look at others is not right. We need to be adjusted, to be saved from many things. We need to grow unto such a salvation. The word unto means &#8220;resulting in&#8221; or &#8220;for.&#8221; We have to grow for salvation and we need a growth that results in salvation. If we have no growth, we cannot enjoy the salvation we need.<h2 class=head2>B. Feeding on the Solid Food of the Word</h2><p>As they grow up in the divine life, the regenerated believers have to feed on the solid food also, not only on the milk, by exercising their spirit to contact the Spirit of God&#8217;s word that they may receive the supply of life (Heb. 5:13-14; Matt. 4:4b). Our receiving the supply of life is for our maturity in life. Even in the section of feeding, the Spirit and our spirit both are involved.<h2 class=head1>III. TO OPEN THE THIRD SECTION OF DISPOSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION</h2><p>(Point III of this message is recomposed to replace what was spoken in the conference. All the attendants of the international blending of the co-workers and elders: please read this recomposed portion as a special loving request.)<h2 class=head2>A. In the Holy Spirit</h2><p>God&#8217;s sanctification of us is of three aspects. The first aspect is His seeking sanctification by the Holy Spirit with the enlightening Word initially (1 Pet. 1:2; Luke 15:8); the second aspect is the positional sanctification by the redeeming blood of Christ judicially (Heb. 13:12; 10:29); the third aspect is the dispositional sanctification by the Holy Spirit organically (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22). We have covered the first two aspects on other occasions. What is covered in this message is the third aspect. Romans 15:16 unveils to us that the believers in Christ are sanctified in the Holy Spirit to be acceptable to God, especially the Gentile believers, who are more common. All the regenerated and growing believers need to be sanctified in their disposition with the element of the resurrection life of Christ, which they received through the feeding, so that they may be sanctified with the holy nature of God (2 Pet. 1:4) that they may be made holy unto God (Eph. 1:4). The sanctification mentioned in Romans 6:19 and 22 refers to this kind of sanctification. Our fallen nature became a fallen disposition, distorted, crooked, and perverted, which needs to be adjusted and straightened particularly in God&#8217;s sanctification with His holy nature.<h2 class=head2>B. From Our Spirit, through Our Soul, and unto Our Body</h2><p>The dispositional and organic sanctification by the Holy Spirit begins from our spirit, through our soul, unto our body, so that our entire being can be wholly sanctified. First Thessalonians 5:23 says clearly that the Holy Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying us begins from our spirit (not from our soul or our body), through our soul, unto our body, that our entire being can be wholly unto God.<h2 class=head1>IV. TO OPEN THE FOURTH SECTION OF RENEWING</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Renewing of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Going along with the dispositional sanctification, the Lord renews us by His Spirit (Titus 3:5).<h2 class=head2>B. Being Renewed in the Spirit of Our Mind</h2><p>The renewing Spirit is mingled with our regenerated spirit as one mingled spirit to spread into our mind (Eph. 4:23) to renew our entire being as a member of the new man by putting off our old man (Eph. 4:22), that is, by renouncing and denying our old self (Matt. 16:24), and by putting on the new man (Eph. 4:24), that is, by applying what Christ has accomplished in creating the new man (Eph. 2:15).<p>Ephesians 4:23 says that we are to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. To put off the old man and to put on the new man are by being renewed in the spirit of our mind. When the Holy Spirit who dwells in and is mingled with our spirit spreads into our mind, that mingled spirit becomes the spirit in our mind. It is by this mingled spirit that our mind is renewed.<p>We have been made a new man by Christ on the cross. Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ on the cross created the two, the Jews and the Gentiles, into one new man. He created the new man already, but we have to apply the new man. We have to put off the old man and put on the new man by the renewing Spirit mingling Himself with our spirit to spread into our mind and renew our mind. This is to change our mind.<p>In Matthew 16:24 the Lord says that if we want to come after Him we need to deny ourselves and take up our cross. To deny ourselves is to renounce ourselves, to apply the cross to ourselves. This is to put off the old man. To put on the new man is to live and magnify Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19-21). The renewing is altogether wrapped up with the Spirit and our regenerated spirit which became the one spirit. This one spirit is the renewing spirit in our mind to change our mind.<h2 class=head2>C. The Consuming of Our Outer Man</h2><p>The Lord uses the environmental sufferings to consume, to kill, our outer man that our inner man may be renewed day by day. Second Corinthians 4:16 says, &#8220;Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying [is consumed], yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&#8221; The outer man should be consumed, killed, so that the inner man, our regenerated spirit as the person with the renewed soul as its organ, may be renewed day by day. This renewing is by God&#8217;s working with every situation in our daily environment. Every day we are troubled from many directions. This trouble could be from our spouse, our children, or our co-workers. This trouble consumes our outer man, our natural man, so that our inner man can be renewed with the supply of the resurrection life.<h2 class=head2>D. Becoming as New as the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Since we believers all will be the consummating part of the New Jerusalem, we have to be renewed to be as new as the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). The New Jerusalem is first called the holy city, so we have to be holy. Then it is called the New Jerusalem, so we have to be new. If we are not renewed, we are not qualified to be in the New Jerusalem. We have to be as new as the New Jerusalem.<h2 class=head1>V. TO OPEN THE FIFTH SECTION OF TRANSFORMATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Transformation by the Renewing of Our Mind</h2><p>Transformation is by the renewing of our mind; it is the issue of the renewing. Romans 12:2 says that we are transformed by the renewing of the mind. When your mind is renewed, you are transformed. Transformation is not any kind of outward correction, adjustment, but an inward metabolism by the addition of the element of the divine life of Christ into our being to be expressed outwardly in the image of Christ. Our digestion and assimilation of food are a kind of metabolism to receive a new element and discharge the old element. Because we have Christ&#8217;s life element added into our spirit, there is a kind of metabolism to bring forth something to be expressed outwardly in Christ&#8217;s image. If a person does not eat for a number of days, his face will become pale. In order to get a healthy color in his face, he needs to be fed properly. Then his face will become healthy and colorful. This is for expression. Today the spiritual transformation is the same. We must have Christ&#8217;s life element added into us by eating Him as our spiritual food. Then there will be the metabolism to discharge the old element by adding the new element of Christ&#8217;s life. Then this will be expressed outwardly to be the image of Christ. This transformation, this kind of metabolism, is by the Lord Spirit (the pneumatic Christ) to transform us into the image of the glory of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18). The Lord has now become the Spirit, and this Lord Spirit is the transforming Spirit.<h2 class=head2>B. Living and Walking by the Spirit</h2><p>We have to live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25) and walk according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4b), that the divine life of Christ may regulate us to transform us into the image of the Lord in glory. The Spirit not only causes a divine metabolism in us but also regulates us. He regulates our walk, and this also causes transformation in us. From within there is the metabolism; from without there is the regulation.<h2 class=head1>VI. TO OPEN THE SIXTH SECTION OF BUILDING</h2><h2 class=head2>A. Building with Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones</h2><p>First Corinthians 3:9 and 12 unveil to us that we are God&#8217;s building and we have to build with gold (signifying God the Father&#8217;s golden nature), silver (God the Son&#8217;s redeeming work), and precious stones (God the Spirit&#8217;s transforming work), not with wood (signifying the nature of the natural man), grass (the fallen man, the man of the flesh), and stubble (the work and living that issue from an earthen source). This indicates that the building of God in which we are participating must be by transformed items like gold, silver, and precious stones, not by our nature, our flesh, and the things from the earthen source.<h2 class=head2>B. Signified by the Jasper Wall with Its Foundations of the New Jerusalem</h2><p>The building of God as the building of the church, the Body of Christ, being by the transformation of the Spirit is clearly signified by the jasper wall with its foundations of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:18-20). Jasper is a transformed precious stone and the wall of the New Jerusalem looks like one big piece of jasper, indicating that while the stones were under transformation, they were also built together. Hence, both the building and transformation are by the same transforming and building Spirit. The building Spirit is just the transforming Spirit. The two are linked together. Where transformation is, there is building. Today in the church it is the same-no transformation, no building. Coordination is not the building. The building is by the transforming life. When we are transformed, we are built together with others. Let us say that a number of brothers are working together. When the peculiarity of each brother comes out, it will be hard for them to coordinate, needless to say to grow together as a building. These brothers can be built together only by being transformed. Through their transformation they grow together. Transformation produces the growth of life, and this growth builds them together. This is the real building of today&#8217;s church. The real building is not just coordination. Our coordination, sooner or later, will be broken if we are not transformed. Perhaps a certain brother feels that he cannot go along with another brother because of that brother&#8217;s strong peculiarity. What should this brother do? He must go to the cross to set up an example for the other brother to follow. After a period of time they will both learn how to be crossed out in order to be transformed. Then they will not need to worry about coordination, because they will grow together. The members of our physical body are not merely coordinated. They are growing together by the blood circulation.<h2 class=head2>C. The Dwelling Place of God in Our Spirit</h2><p>Paul&#8217;s writings unveil to us that the church, the Body of Christ, as the dwelling place of God is in our spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God (Eph. 2:22; Rom. 8:11). This shows that the building of the church is altogether involved with two spirits, the divine Spirit and our human spirit. The divine Spirit is the Dweller, and our spirit is the abiding place. Our being built up to be God&#8217;s dwelling place is wrapped up with the two spirits.<h2 class=head2>D. Christ Building His Home in Our Hearts</h2><p>Christ makes (builds) His home in our hearts through the strengthening of the Spirit of God into our inner man (our regenerated spirit) where Christ is (2 Tim. 4:22), unto the fullness (expression) of God (Eph. 3:16-19). Ephesians 3 tells us that today Christ is making His home in our heart. This making home is the building. This takes place first by our being strengthened with power through the Spirit into our inner man, into our spirit. Then Christ has the chance to build His home in our heart so that we may be filled unto, resulting in, the fullness of the Triune God for the expression of the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>E. God the Father and the Son Making a Mutual Abode with the Lover of Christ</h2><p>Based upon the fact that the Spirit of God dwells within the lover of Christ (John 14:17), God the Father and the Son come to the lover of Christ and make a mutual abode with him (v. 23). John 14:23 says that if anyone loves the Son, the Father and He will come to make an abode with him. This means to make a mutual dwelling place for the Triune God and the believer. The indwelling Spirit is mentioned in verse 17. Based upon this fact, the Father and the Son come to make a mutual dwelling place with us. This is building. In John 14:2 the Lord said, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes.&#8221; Verse 23 tells us how these many abodes are built up. It is by the Spirit living in us as a foundation; then the Father and the Son come to us to make a mutual abode with us. All these verses are very mystical.<p>In God&#8217;s organic salvation, first our life is touched, that is, God in regeneration puts Himself into our spirit to be our life. Our life now has an addition. In the past we had only our human life. But through regeneration we began to have another life which was added into our old life, and this life is God&#8217;s life. This is not an exchange but the addition of another life. Then our nature is sanctified with the nature of God. Then our mind is changed by having God&#8217;s mind in our mind through the mingled spirit. This means that our entire being is transformed.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>&#8220;THE SPIRIT HIMSELF WITH OUR SPIRIT&#8221; THE KEY TO OPEN THE EIGHT SECTIONS OF THE ORGANIC SALVATION OF GOD</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman" start="7"><li>To open the seventh section of conformation:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Conformation is the consummation of transformation.

You want to make us exactly the same as You are in life and nature but not in the Godhead. Lord, You have added Your divine life to our created, fallen, redeemed, and resurrected humanity. Lord, You have sanctified our crooked disposition to make us like You are in Your holy nature. Lord, You are still working until we are redeemed in our body to make us like You. Eventually, we will be able to say, &#8220;Lord, what You are, we are, and what we are, You are.&#8221; The only difference is that You have the Godhead. We thank You and worship You that we don&#8217;t have the Godhead. You are the unique God. You are the Triune God, processed and consummated. We have humanity plus divinity, and You have divinity plus humanity. What a wonder that God has humanity! The processed, consummated Triune God has humanity. Lord, open the heavens to us. We want to be in heaven to see all the things as You see them. Give us the utterance. This is absolutely a new culture in a mystical realm. We need Your language; we need Your utterance.<h2 class=head1>VII. TO OPEN THE SEVENTH SECTION OF CONFORMATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Consummation of Transformation</h2><p>Conformation is the consummation of transformation. Transformation is a gradual work to transform us into the glorious image of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18) that needs a consummation. We are still in the process of being transformed, but our transformation has not yet been consummated. The consummation of our transformation is our conformation to conform the transformed believers to the image of the firstborn Son of God-the first God-man (Rom. 8:29).<p>We need to see the difference between Christ as the only begotten Son and as the firstborn Son of God. Christ being the Firstborn indicates that many sons are following Him. In Christ&#8217;s resurrection three big items were produced: the firstborn Son was produced, the life-giving Spirit who is the transfiguration of the last Adam was produced (1 Cor. 15:45b), and all the chosen, predestinated ones were regenerated (1 Pet. 1:3). What an outcome this was!<h2 class=head2>B. The Full Growth of the Processed Triune God</h2><p>Such a conformation is the full growth of the processed Triune God-the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the Spirit-as the divine life in Christ (Col. 1:28) that grows in the believers unto maturity.<h2 class=head2>C. The Full-grown Man</h2><p>It is also the full-grown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13). The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (1:23), which has a stature with a measure. Christ is all-inclusive and all-extensive, unlimited; He is the One who fills all in all. Such a One has a Body, and this Body is His expression. This Body has a stature, and the stature has a measure. Who can measure the stature of the Body of Christ, the fullness of the unlimited Christ? But our conformation to the image of the firstborn Son of God will be the full-grown man at the proper measure of the proper stature of the proper expression of Christ. The Body is the aggregate of all the believers who through transformation have been conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God. This is the full-grown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Although such a measure is immeasurable, we can attain it through our conformation.<h2 class=head1>VIII. TO OPEN THE EIGHTH SECTION OF GLORIFICATION</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Final Step of God&#8217;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>Glorification is the final step of God&#8217;s organic salvation in Christ which brings the conformed believers into God&#8217;s glory (Rom. 8:18, 21; Heb. 2:10; 1 Pet. 5:10). If we want to enter into glory, we have to be conformed to Christ&#8217;s image. We have to finish our &#8220;four-year course.&#8221; Then a &#8220;graduation&#8221; will be granted to us. Glorification is the graduation of the full Christian-life course. We will not enter into glory in a spontaneous way according to the concept of many Christians. Glorification is the consummation of a gradual work beginning from regeneration and continuing through feeding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, and conformation. Then a &#8220;graduation paper&#8221; will be issued to us, which will be our glorification.<h2 class=head2>B. The Saturating of God&#8217;s Glory from within the Believers</h2><p>Such a glorification is the saturating of God&#8217;s glory from within the believers like the inking of the sealing which the believers received at their salvation (Eph. 1:13; 4:30). When a seal with much ink is applied to some pages of paper, it will saturate through to the last page. Ephesians 4:30 says that we are sealed with the Spirit unto the day of redemption. Unto means &#8220;resulting in.&#8221; This inking of the sealing Spirit will eventually result in the redemption of our body at our glorification.<p>How much freedom do we give this inking in our Christian life? To be smoothly sanctified dispositionally, renewed, transformed, and conformed means that we allow the inking to proceed quickly within us unto our glorification. To be in the glory has two aspects. On the one hand, we will enter into glory. On the other hand, this glory saturates us from within by the inking of the sealing Spirit throughout our entire Christian life. We need to be under the inking of the Spirit day by day. Then we will enter into glory through this inward inking, which is the saturating of God&#8217;s glory from within us.<h2 class=head2>C. The Redemption of the Believers&#8217; Body</h2><p>Such a glorification is to transfigure our body of humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory (Phil. 3:21). Hence, it is called the redemption of the believers&#8216; body (Eph. 4:30; Rom. 8:23). The Greek word for transformation and transfiguration is the same. To be transfigured is the last step of transformation. It is to change the form of our outward body. Our body today is a body of humiliation, but it will be transfigured into another form of another body, that is, into the glorious body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>D. The Full Enjoyment of Our Sonship</h2><p>Such a glorification, the redemption of our body, is the full enjoyment of our sonship (Rom. 8:23). We are the sons of God, but our body has not yet been &#8220;sonized.&#8221; Our body will be sonized when it is redeemed. To be transfigured, to be redeemed, is to be sonized. We were born sons of God at the time of our regeneration, but at that time only our spirit was sonized. Regeneration is the first step of sonizing. Organic feeding, sanctification, renewing, transformation, building, and conformation are the following steps. The last step is the sonizing of our body.<p>God regenerated us with His divine life. That means He added His divine life to our human life. Our human life was created by God, but it became fallen. This is why we need redemption. Redemption means to redeem back judicially the right thing that was lost. When the Lord died on the cross, He died with us, with our natural man. We were crucified with Him, buried with Him, and also resurrected with Him (Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:4; Eph. 2:6). Therefore, we have been created, fallen, redeemed judicially, uplifted, and resurrected. Our human life and God&#8217;s life have been grafted together (Rom. 11:17). Otherwise, how could we live with Him? We live with Him because we have our own life plus His life. Regeneration is to have the divine, spiritual life of God in addition to our human life.<p>After our regeneration we are dispositionally sanctified with the element of the resurrection life of Christ. Through sanctification our distorted, crooked, perverted, natural nature is adjusted and straightened with His holy nature. The Holy Spirit dispenses God&#8217;s holy nature into our being to straighten our crooked disposition. Because we partake of the divine nature, which is perfect and straight, our nature is corrected.<p>Then our mind is renewed, changed. Philippians 2 says that we should have the mind of Christ (v. 5). God&#8217;s renewing work takes place by His Spirit mingling with our spirit to saturate our mind with all the thoughts and logic of God, to change our mind. Based on regeneration, sanctification, and renewing, the Lord Spirit today is transforming our being by the addition of His divine life to cause a divine metabolism within us. This transforms our entire being.<p>Eventually, this transformation will be completed to make us a full-grown man at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, who is the aggregate of the Triune God. Finally, through the saturation of God&#8217;s glory within us, the glory will come out from us. Then we will enter into glory and will be in glory. When we attain this glory, we will say, &#8220;Lord God, what a mercy and grace that we are what You are, and You are what we are.&#8221; This is the ultimate consummation of the eight sections of God&#8217;s organic salvation.<p>God&#8217;s full salvation is not just to redeem us judicially to forgive us, wash us, justify us, reconcile us to Him, and sanctify us positionally. This was carried out by Christ in the flesh in His earthly ministry. God&#8217;s judicial redemption was merely the procedure for Him to save us organically as the life-giving Spirit, as the pneumatic Christ, for us to participate in God&#8217;s organic salvation as the purpose of the complete salvation of God in Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head1>IX. TO OPEN THE ADDITIONAL SECTION OF THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED ORGANIC SALVATION OF GOD</h2><p>According to Isaiah 30:26 the light of the sun will be sevenfold intensified in the millennium. Today we have the Spirit sevenfold intensified.<h2 class=head1>NOTE-THE THREE SECTIONS OF CHRIST&#8217;S MINISTRY</h2><h2 class=head2>His Earthly Ministry</h2><p>The first section of His earthly ministry was accomplished by Him judicially in the physical realm as the Christ in the flesh from His incarnation to His death within His human age of thirty-three and a half years.<h2 class=head2>His Heavenly Ministry</h2><p>The second section of His heavenly ministry is carried out by Him organically in the mystical realm as the Christ as the life-giving Spirit from His resurrection to the end of the millennium within the age of the church and the age of the kingdom. Incarnation was the first start, the start of His life in the flesh. But resurrection is another start, the start of His being the Spirit, to carry out His heavenly ministry.<h2 class=head2>His Sevenfold Intensified Heavenly Ministry</h2><p>The third section of His sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is carried out by Him sevenfold intensified organically in the mystical realm as the Christ as the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit from the degradation of the church to the coming of the new heaven and new earth. The degradation of the church began within the first century. In 2 Timothy Paul told us that all in Asia had turned away from him, leaving his ministry (1:15). Also, ones like Hymenaeus and Philetus were trying to overthrow the truth concerning the resurrection, saying the resurrection had already taken place (2:17-18). Paul mentioned Demas abandoning him because of his love for the present age (4:10). He also spoke of Alexander the coppersmith doing many evil things to him (4:14). Alexander the coppersmith must have known Paul well. Otherwise, he could not have been his opposer. All these descriptions show us the degradation of the church. Shortly after writing 2 Timothy around A.D. 67, Paul was martyred. Less than thirty years later, John wrote the book of Revelation which shows the degradation of the churches. He also wrote 2 John, which is an Epistle revealing the prohibition against heresy, which was already creeping into the church.<p>The book of Revelation opens in this way: &#8220;Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth&#8221; (1:4-5). In these verses the seven Spirits are listed as the second of the Divine Trinity. Then the book of Revelation gives us a full record of the move of the sevenfold Spirit in Christ&#8217;s heavenly ministry to do a number of things.<h2 class=head2>A. To:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. Save the Believers in the Church in Ephesus</h2><p>The sevenfold intensified Spirit worked to save the believers in the church in Ephesus from the formal church life, which had lost the first love to the Lord, the shining capacity of the lampstand, and the enjoyment of Christ as life, to become overcomers so that they would be rewarded to eat of the tree of life in the Paradise of God-the New Jerusalem in the kingdom age (Rev. 2:1-7).<h2 class=head3>2. Strengthen the Suffering Believers in the Church in Smyrna</h2><p>Christ as the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit worked to strengthen the suffering believers in the church in Smyrna to overcome the persecution by being martyred so that they would be rewarded not to taste the second death during the kingdom age (2:8-11). This shows that the believers who do not overcome will taste the second death.<h2 class=head3>3. Sanctify the Believers in the Church in Pergamos</h2><p>The church in Pergamos had become married to the world, so Christ as the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit worked to sanctify the believers there from the union with the world and from the teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans to be the overcomers so that they might be rewarded to eat the hidden manna and to have a white stone upon which a new name would be written in the kingdom age (2:12-17).<h2 class=head3>4. Rescue the Believers in the Church in Thyatira</h2><p>The sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit works to rescue the believers in the church in Thyatira from idol worship, fornication, demonic teachings, and the deep things of Satan to be the overcomers so that they may be rewarded with the authority over the nations in the kingdom age (2:18-29).<h2 class=head3>5. Revive the Believers in the Church in Sardis</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is to revive the believers in the church in Sardis from their dead and dying condition to be the overcomers so that they may be rewarded with walking with the Lord in white and with not having their names erased from the book of life but confessed by the Lord before the Father and His angels in the kingdom age (3:1-6).<h2 class=head3>6. Encourage the Believers in the Church in Philadelphia</h2><p>Although Philadelphia is the best church, the believers there need to hold fast what they have that no one take their crown to be the overcomers so that they may be rewarded to be a pillar in the temple of God with the name of God and the name of the New Jerusalem and the new name of the Lord written upon them in the kingdom age (3:7-13). The name which is upon them indicates that this is what they are. That means that they are the New Jerusalem, and they are God because they have God&#8217;s name upon them. Also, they are the Lord Jesus because they have His new name written upon them. Of course, their being God and the Lord Jesus is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.<h2 class=head3>7. Awake the Believers in the Church in Laodicea</h2><p>The believers in the church in Laodicea need to be awakened from their lukewarm and Christless condition. Thus, the Lord exhorts them to pay the price for the refined gold, white garments, and eyesalve and to open their door to the knocking Lord to be the overcomers so that they may be rewarded to sit on the throne of the Lord in the kingdom age (3:14-22). They are not only lukewarm but also Christless because Christ is outside, knocking on the door of the church.<h2 class=head2>B. By:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The Speaking of the Sevenfold Intensified Pneumatic Christ</h2><p>We are saved from degradation by the speaking of the unlimited, life-releasing, sevenfold intensified pneumatic Christ (the Lamb with the seven Spirits as His eyes-Rev. 5:6). The seven Spirits are the eyes of Christ, who is the Lamb. No one can separate your eyes from your person. The sevenfold Spirit being the eyes of Christ indicates that they are one with Christ. The speaking of the sevenfold intensified pneumatic Christ to the seven churches at the beginning of each epistle respectively becomes the speaking of the sevenfold intensified, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit to all the seven churches at the end of each epistle universally (Rev. 2:1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18, 29; 3:1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 22). At the beginning of each epistle Christ is speaking, and at the end the Spirit is speaking. This shows that Christ is the Spirit.<h2 class=head3>2. The Overcoming Saints Living in Their Spirit</h2><p>The overcoming of the degradation is by the participation of the overcoming saints who are living in their spirit (Rev. 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10). On the one hand, our overcoming is by Christ&#8217;s speaking becoming the Spirit&#8217;s speaking. On the other hand, it is by our living in our spirit all the time. In Revelation 1:10 John said that on the Lord&#8217;s Day he was in spirit. This shows that John the apostle was a man in the spirit, always living in the spirit.<h2 class=head2>C. For:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. The Complete Preparation of the Bride for Christ</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is for the complete preparation of the bride for Christ the Bridegroom to have His triumphant wedding in the millennium for His satisfaction according to His good pleasure (Rev. 19:7-9).<h2 class=head3>2. The Formation of the Bridal Army</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is also for the formation of the bridal army for Christ to defeat and destroy His top enemies in humanity, the Antichrist and his false prophet (Rev. 19:11-21; 17:14). The coming Antichrist and his false prophet will be human enemies of Christ, attacking Christ to the uttermost. They will fight face to face with an army against Christ. But Christ and His bride will destroy them and throw them into the lake of fire.<h2 class=head3>3. The Binding of Satan</h2><p>Christ&#8217;s sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is for the binding of Satan and the casting of him into the abyss for one thousand years (Rev. 20:1-3).<h2 class=head3>4. The Kingdom of Christ and of God</h2><p>His sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is also for the bringing in of the kingdom of Christ and of God, which will be the millennium (Rev. 20:4-6).<h2 class=head3>5. The Consummation of the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Ultimately, Christ&#8217;s sevenfold intensified heavenly ministry is for the initial consummation of the New Jerusalem in the millennium (Rev. 2:7) and its full consummation in the new heaven and new earth (21:2). In other words, the New Jerusalem will be consummated by the overcomers first in the initial part in the thousand years on a small scale and then in eternity on a full scale. All the believers, through the discipline of the one thousand years, will be matured, transformed, and conformed, to participate in the New Jerusalem in eternity.<h2 class=head2>D. The Final Outcome</h2><p>The final outcome is that the ultimately consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God becomes the Bridegroom and the aggregate of the overcoming saints becomes the bride of the universal romance between the redeeming God and His redeemed man as the conclusion of the entire Scriptures (Rev. 22:17). The conclusion of the entire Bible is a couple, which is the consummation of the universal romance of the redeeming God and His redeemed man. The Bridegroom is God as the consummated Spirit, and the bride is the aggregate of all the overcomers. This is all accomplished by the additional section of the sevenfold intensified organic salvation of God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE UNIQUE GROUND OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES OF GOD AND THE UNIQUE ONENESS OF THE UNIVERSAL BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:1-2, 9, 10-13; 3:3-4; Eph. 4:3-6</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The unique ground of the local churches of God-1 Cor. 1:1-2, 9, 10-13; 3:3-4:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The church of God-the content of the church in its essence-1:2a.</li>	<li>The church at Corinth-the locality for the existence, expression, and practice of the church (1:2b); such a locality becomes the local ground of the local churches on which they are built respectively (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11).</li>	<li>Those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints-the constituents as the framework of the church-1:2c.</li>	<li>With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place-the recipients of this Epistle in every place other than the saints in Corinth-1:2d.</li>	<li>Christ is &#8220;theirs and ours&#8221;-Christ is the portion of the local saints in Corinth and of all the saints in whatever place, who participate in the fellowship (enjoyment) of Christ, into which all the believers have been called by the faithful God- 1:2e, 9.</li>	<li>Divisions among the saints are condemned by the apostle as the deputy authority of Christ the Head-1:10-13.</li>	<li>Christ is not divided-Christ is unique, not divisible nor divided-1:13.</li>	<li>Division is of the flesh, according to the manner of man-3:3-4.</li>	<li>Our practice under today&#8217;s divisive and confusing degradation of Christianity:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>We do not and should not participate in the Catholic heresy, the Protestant denominations, and any kind of free groups of Christians.</li>		<li>But we recognize and receive the individual believers in Christ who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, redeemed by His blood and regenerated by the Holy Spirit, who are not factious (Titus 3:10), not making divisions (Rom. 16:17), not worshipping idols, nor living in sin (1 Cor. 5:11), even if they are still related to any of the above listed divisions.</li>		<li>We are one with all the believers who are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery throughout the world.</li>		<li>We do not have any creed; we have only the unique Bible properly translated and interpreted by and according to the Bible itself.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>The unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ-Eph. 4:3-6:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ is of the Spirit, which oneness believers should not break but keep diligently in the uniting bond of peace-v. 3.</li>	<li>In the whole universe there is only one unique Body of Christ, with the Triune God as its contents-vv. 4-6:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The one Spirit as the essence of its contents.</li>		<li>The one Lord as the element of its contents.</li>		<li>God the Father as the source of its contents, who is over all and through all and in all triunely.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The blending of the universal Body of Christ:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>God has blended the Body together (1 Cor. 12:24):			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The blending of all the individual members of the Body of Christ.</li>			<li>The blending of all the churches in certain districts.</li>			<li>The blending of all the co-workers.</li>			<li>The blending of all the elders.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Such a blending is not social but the blending of the very Christ whom the individual members, the district churches, the co-workers, and the elders enjoy, experience, and partake of.</li>		<li>For the building up of the universal Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23) to consummate the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2) as the final goal of God&#8217;s economy according to His good pleasure (Eph. 3:8-10; 1:9-10).</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that You have brought us through all the previous fellowship. We believe You will give us a glorious conclusion. You are the Alpha and the Omega. We trust in You. Lord, thank You that all the time we depend upon Your mercy, Your blessing, Your provisions, the Word and the Spirit, and Your presence. Lord, without these we are just like a dead dog. We can do nothing, we can have nothing, and we can be nothing. Lord, this is what we are. But we trust in You. You are everything to us for the purpose of making us the same as You are in life and in nature but not in Your Godhead. We thank You for this. We worship You. The main point in these days that You have unveiled to us is that You want to have a group of people to be remade through regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification to be the same as You are. We thank You for Yourself. Amen.<p>The ground of the church and the oneness of the Body of Christ are old subjects to us. I have been speaking about these things for over sixty-five years, but these subjects are very critical. Within the past fifteen months, the Lord has raised up over three hundred new churches around the globe, and these new churches must be clear about the local ground and the universal oneness. The ground is concerning the churches of God, and the oneness is concerning the Body of Christ. The ground and the oneness are unique, which means that the ground for the church and the oneness for the Body are just one.<h2 class=head1>I. THE UNIQUE GROUND OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES OF GOD</h2><p>First, we want to see the unique ground of the local churches of God (1 Cor. 1:1-2, 9, 10-13; 3:3-4).<h2 class=head2>A. The Church of God</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:2a speaks of the church of God. The church has to be of God. It should not be of anything else. This refers to the content of the church in its essence. Every substantial matter has its source. Then it has its element. Intrinsically within the element, there is the essence. The content of the church essentially is God Himself.<h2 class=head2>B. The Church at Corinth</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:2b speaks of the church at Corinth. This shows the locality of Corinth for the existence, expression, and practice of the church; such a locality becomes the local ground of the local churches on which they are built respectively (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11). For its existence, expression, and practice, the church surely needs a place, and that place according to the New Testament is a locality. The church in Corinth was built in Corinth. The church in Athens is built on the ground of the city of Athens. The church in New York is built on the ground of the city of New York. Thus, the locality spontaneously becomes the church ground.<p>Brother Watchman Nee pointed out that God was very wise in His way of building up the church on the local ground. There are a great number of God&#8217;s chosen people. Everywhere around the globe there are believers in Christ, and they should not be scattered but gathered together to be a church. If there were not the proper limitation of the ground, there would be no limitation to the setting up of churches. Today in Southern California there is a church called the Taiwan Gospel Church. These believers have used Taiwan as their ground. I was raised in China in the city of Chefoo, and in Chefoo there was the Church of England. People set up churches too easily. Today it is easier to establish a church than it is to set up a restaurant. All the denominations have divisive grounds, including the Southern Baptists, the Presbyterians, and the Lutherans.<p>If we believers keep the pattern set up by God in the Bible to have one church in one city, we can keep the oneness. Any believer who comes to a city has to be in the church in that city. If I go to Tokyo, I should join the church in Tokyo. If I go to London, I should go to the church in London. If I go to Dallas, I have to meet with the church in Dallas. Then spontaneously there will be no division. The Bible set up a pattern of how the believers should meet. The first gathering of the Christians was in Jerusalem, and Acts 8:1 calls that gathering the church in Jerusalem. Jerusalem was a large city, but there was only one church in that city. Although there is one church in a city, the church does not necessarily need to meet in one place. But we must keep in mind that the city in which we are should be the unique local ground of the church.<h2 class=head2>C. The Called Saints</h2><p>Those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, are the constituents as the framework of the church (1 Cor. 1:2c). The Triune God is the contents of the church, with the Spirit as the essence, the Lord as the element, and the Father as the source. The church&#8217;s framework is the genuine believers, the real saints, the sanctified ones in Christ Jesus. The church must be of God, on its local ground, and with the saints as the constituents.<h2 class=head2>D. With All Those Who Call upon the Name of the Lord</h2><p>First Corinthians was written to the saints in Corinth with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place-the recipients of this Epistle in every place other than the saints in Corinth (1:2d). Even today we are the recipients of this book. This Epistle was written to the church in Corinth, the composition of the saints in that city, but it has been and will be read by people in thousands of places throughout the generations.<h2 class=head2>E. Christ Being &#8220;Theirs and Ours&#8221;</h2><p>Christ being &#8220;theirs and ours&#8221; means that Christ is the portion of the local saints in Corinth and of all the saints in whatever place, who participate in the fellowship (enjoyment) of Christ, into which all the believers have been called by the faithful God (1:2e, 9). The same Christ is the portion not only for one local church but also for all the churches on the earth. He is the common portion allotted to us by God. Every local church has a portion of Christ. Also, we have been called by the faithful God into the fellowship of Christ. As called saints, Christ is our portion, and we have been called into the enjoyment, the fellowship, of Christ as the center.<h2 class=head2>F. Divisions among the Saints Being Condemned by the Apostle</h2><p>Divisions among the saints are condemned by the apostle as the deputy authority of Christ the Head (1:10-13). Paul wrote to the church in Corinth because he heard that there were divisions among them. Some said that they were of Paul, others that they were of Apollos, others that they were of Cephas, and still others that they were of Christ. They were divided into four groups, but Paul asked them, &#8220;Is Christ divided?&#8221; It was as if Paul were asking, &#8220;How many Christs do you have? Do you have a Christ for Cephas, for Apollos, for Paul, and even for Christ? Regardless of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, and of Christ, what you have is only one Christ. The fellowship you all are in is the fellowship of one unique Christ. Christ is not divided.&#8221; Divisions among the saints were condemned by the apostle as Christ&#8217;s deputy authority.<h2 class=head2>G. Christ Not Divided</h2><p>Christ is unique, not divisible nor divided (1:13). What a shame it is that there are so many divisions among today&#8217;s Christians when Christ is not divided.<h2 class=head2>H. Division Being of the Flesh</h2><p>Paul said that division is of the flesh, according to the manner of man (3:3-4). The Taiwanese want to have a Taiwan Gospel Church because they like the flavor of Taiwan. Some Chinese brothers do not like to attend the English meetings, because they miss the Chinese flavor. Even within the United States there are the Texans and the New Yorkers and the blacks and the whites, whose cultural pride and natural preferences are divisive. We should not have our own flavor. Being divided because of any racial, national, or cultural flavor is fleshly, according to the manner of man and not according to the manner of the saints.<p>Concerning the spiritual and divine things for the church, we must keep in mind four crucial points. First, we must go through the cross. Our native flavor should be crossed out by Christ. Both the Americans and the Chinese should be crossed out. In the church there is room for no natural person, but Christ is all and in all (Col. 3:11). On the cross both the Jews and the Gentiles were crossed out. Second, everything should be by the Spirit. Third, this is to dispense Christ to others. Fourth, everything is for the building up of the church. In other words, whatever we do should be through the cross by the Spirit to dispense Christ to others for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.<p>But today people would not take the cross or live by the Spirit. Instead, they would live by their flesh. They would not care for dispensing Christ. Instead, they care for their kind of social life. After our meetings, we like to congregate with the ones who match our natural background. The Chinese go to the Chinese and the Americans go to the Americans. This shows that we need to be crossed out. The Japanese flavor, the Chinese flavor, the Taiwanese flavor, and the American flavor all have to be crossed out. We should not do things according to our feeling but according to the Spirit. We should not enjoy Christ merely for ourselves but to dispense Christ to others. The flavor of our natural man with our culture is the flavor of men, the flavor of the flesh. That has to be crossed out by the Spirit in order that we may dispense Christ for the church.<h2 class=head2>I. Our Practice Today</h2><p>We need to know what our practice is under today&#8217;s divisive and confusing degradation of Christianity. We do not and should not participate in the Catholic heresy, the Protestant denominations, and any kind of free groups of Christians. To participate in any of these things is to participate in a division. But we recognize and receive the individual believers in Christ who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, who are redeemed by His blood and regenerated by the Holy Spirit, and who are not factious (Titus 3:10), not making divisions (Rom. 16:17), and not worshipping idols or living in sin (1 Cor. 5:11), even if they are still related to any of the above listed divisions. Romans 16:17 says that we are to mark those who make, or create, divisions. There are four kinds of people we cannot tolerate: people who are divisive, factious, worshipping idols, or still living in sin. We receive anyone who is not in these categories, because we are not divisive, but we cannot go to their meetings, because their meetings are divisive.<p>We are one with all the believers who are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery throughout the world. Also, we do not have any creed; we have only the unique Bible properly translated and interpreted by and according to the Bible itself. God&#8217;s Word is inspired. We should interpret the Bible only according to the Bible. For example, the disciples of Confucius have their concept of renewing, but this is different from the teaching of the Bible. The renewing in the Bible is that our old man should be crossed out and consumed so that the new man within us can be renewed.<p>All of the virtues in the Christian life should be through the cross and by the Spirit to dispense Christ for the church. Many talk about love, but the Bible&#8217;s teaching concerning love is unique. Love must be through the cross by the Spirit to dispense Christ for the church. When we love anyone, we have to check whether or not our self is crossed out and our love is by the Spirit. Also, we do not love people for our interest but for the dispensing of Christ and for the building up of the Body. This is the human virtue of love taught by the Bible, which is absolutely different from the worldly love. This is an example of interpreting the Bible according to the Bible.<h2 class=head1>II. THE UNIQUE ONENESS OF THE UNIVERSAL BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>Ephesians 4:3-6 shows the unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>A. The Oneness of the Spirit</h2><p>The unique oneness of the universal Body of Christ is of the Spirit. Ephesians 4:3 says that we need to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. This is a strong word for us. We fleshly people must keep the oneness of the Spirit. For this we surely must be dealt with by the cross. Our flesh, our nature, our self, our &#8220;I,&#8221; should be crossed out by the cross of Christ. Then we should follow the Spirit. Then we can have the oneness of the Spirit for the dispensing of Christ and for the building up of His Body. We should not break this oneness but keep it diligently in the uniting bond of peace.<h2 class=head2>B. The One Unique Body of Christ</h2><p>In the whole universe, there is only one unique Body of Christ. There is not the Body of Christ in America and another Body of Christ in Japan. In all the places, the Body of Christ is uniquely one with the Triune God as its contents (Eph. 4:4-6). The one Spirit is the essence of its contents. The one Lord is the element of its contents. Also, God the Father is the source of its contents, who is over all and through all and in all triunely. The essence is of the element and the element comes from the source. Even God the Father Himself, in a certain sense, is triune because He is above us, through us, and in us-in three directions. In the Body of Christ the Triune God is the contents-the Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence.<h2 class=head2>C. The Blending of the Universal Body of Christ</h2><h2 class=head3>1. God Having Blended the Body Together</h2><p>God has blended the Body together (1 Cor. 12:24). The word blended also means adjusted, harmonized, tempered, and mingled. God has blended the Body, adjusted the Body, harmonized the Body, tempered the Body, and mingled the Body. The Greek word for blended implies the losing of distinctions. One brother&#8217;s distinction may be quickness, and another&#8217;s may be slowness. But in the Body life the slowness disappears and the quickness is taken away. All such distinctions are gone. God has blended all the believers of all different races and colors. Who can make the blacks and the whites lose their distinctions? Only God can do this. A husband and a wife can have the harmony in their marriage life only by losing their distinctions.<p>In order to be harmonized, blended, adjusted, mingled, and tempered in the Body life, we have to go through the cross and be by the Spirit, dispensing Christ to others for the sake of the Body of Christ. The co-workers and elders must learn to be crossed out. Whatever we do should be by the Spirit to dispense Christ. Also, what we do should not be for our interest and according to our taste but for the church. As long as we practice these points, we will have the blending.<p>All of these points mean that we should fellowship. When a co-worker does anything, he should fellowship with the other co-workers. An elder should fellowship with the other elders. Fellowship tempers us; fellowship adjusts us; fellowship harmonizes us; and fellowship mingles us. We should forget about whether we are slow or quick and just fellowship with others. We should not do anything without fellowshipping with the other saints who are coordinating with us. Fellowship requires us to stop when we are about to do something. In our coordination in the church life, in the Lord&#8217;s work, we all have to learn not to do anything without fellowship.<p>Among us we should have the blending of all the individual members of the Body of Christ, the blending of all the churches in certain districts, the blending of all the co-workers, and the blending of all the elders. Blending means that we should always stop to fellowship with others. Then we will receive many benefits. If we isolate and seclude ourselves, we will lose much spiritual profit. Learn to fellowship. Learn to be blended. From now on, the churches should come together frequently to be blended. We may not be used to it, but after we begin to practice blending a few times, we will acquire the taste for it. This is the most helpful thing in the keeping of the oneness of the universal Body of Christ. Today it is very convenient for us to blend with one another because of this modern age with its modern conveniences.<p>When we blend together, we have the cross and the Spirit. Without the cross and the Spirit, all that we have is the flesh with division. It is not easy to be crucified and to do all things by the Spirit in ourselves. This is why we must learn to be blended. Blending requires us to be crossed out. Blending requires us to be by the Spirit to dispense Christ and to do everything for the sake of His Body.<p>We may come together without much blending because everyone stays in themselves. They are afraid to offend others and make mistakes, so they keep quiet. This is the manner of man according to the flesh. When we come together, we should experience the terminating of the cross. Then we should learn how to follow the Spirit, how to dispense Christ, and how to say and do something for the benefit of the Body. That will change the entire atmosphere of the meeting and will temper the atmosphere. Blending is not a matter of being quiet or talkative but a matter of being tempered. We can be in harmony, because we have been tempered. Eventually, the distinctions will all be gone. Blending means to lose the distinctions. We all have to pay some price to practice the blending.<p>A group of elders may meet together often without being blended. To be blended means that you are touched by others and that you are touching others. But you should touch others in a blending way. Go through the cross, do things by the Spirit, and do everything to dispense Christ for His Body&#8217;s sake. We should not come to a blending meeting to be silent. We have to prepare ourselves to say something for the Lord. The Lord may use you, but you need to be tempered and crossed out, and you need to learn how to follow the Spirit to dispense Christ for His Body&#8217;s sake.<p>When I was only about twenty-seven years old, a church was raised up in my hometown. I learned to do everything through the cross and by the Spirit to minister Christ for His Body. Because I was young, I prayed the prayer of Solomon: &#8220;Lord, give me the wisdom to go out and to come in among Your people&#8221; (2 Chron. 1:10), and the Lord answered me. Through the years, I have learned to be blended among the saints.<h2 class=head3>2. The Blending Not Being Social</h2><p>Such a blending is not social but the blending of the very Christ whom the individual members, the district churches, the co-workers, and the elders enjoy, experience, and partake of.<h2 class=head3>3. For the Building Up of the Body of Christ to Consummate the New Jerusalem</h2><p>The blending is for the building up of the universal Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23) to consummate the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2) as the final goal of God&#8217;s economy according to His good pleasure (Eph. 3:8-10; 1:9-10).</body></html>
