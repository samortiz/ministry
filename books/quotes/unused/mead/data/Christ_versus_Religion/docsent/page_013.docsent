   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LIVING WINESKIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most all of us come from a background of Christianity, where we learned that Christians need to have certain kinds of Christian meetings called services.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to this concept everyone must enter the "sanctuary" quietly and reverently and seat himself properly and in order.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some dear ones who have attended our meetings have been exceedingly disturbed by the shouting and the praises.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let me say a word regarding them: they are unconsciously influenced by their background of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose there are a number of Christians meeting together, everyone dressed nicely, everyone behaving quietly and properly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose that in the same place there is another group of Christians not dressed so well, not behaving so orderly, but shouting and praising Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you were Christ be fair and honest which group would you really appreciate?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not mean which is right or wrong I do not care for this, and I do not believe the Lord Jesus would care for this either.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not a matter of being right or wrong, good or bad it is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Religion says the first group is good, but Christ says it is not good because it has no life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first group is an insult to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is life, and Christ has conquered and subdued death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ would say to the first group, "Why is death so prevailing among you?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely this is not like my church; this is like a cemetery."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The most quiet and orderly place is the cemetery there is no confusion there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because everyone is dead and properly buried.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So many so called Christian churches today are just like that: everyone in them is nicely, properly and beautifully "buried."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, that is not the new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The living church is where Christ is; it is the church composed of living members, making living noise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need such a wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>NEW WINESKINS FOR NEW WINE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On one hand we have the old wineskin, and on the other hand we have the new.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not put the new wine into the old wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some indeed have received the new wine, but they have attempted to bring the new wine back and pour it into the old wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have been witnessing this kind of folly for almost forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people have come to the local church and drunk the new wine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They have said, "This is really wonderful this is just what 'my church' needs."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So they have tried to bring this new wine back to that old wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you know what happened?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The old wineskins burst, and the new wine was spilled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we put the new wine into the new wineskin, however, the Lord Jesus said that both are preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some dear ones have come to appreciate the pray-reading; so they have tried to bring the pray-reading into their old meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They killed their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The new wine simply does not fit in the old wineskins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The new wine requires the new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need Christ as the new garment, we need Christ as the new wine, and we also need Christ in a corporate way as the new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not care for any doctrine, teaching, or form, but just for Christ in you and Christ in me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the new wineskin.</S>
