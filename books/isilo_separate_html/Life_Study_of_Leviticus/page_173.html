Being Holy to God and Not Profaning the Name of God, for They Offer the Offerings by Fire as the Food of God</h2><p>Leviticus 21:6 says, &#8220;They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they offer the offerings of Jehovah by fire, the food of their God; therefore they shall be holy.&#8221; Verse 8 goes on to say, &#8220;You shall sanctify him, for he offers the food of your God; he shall be holy to you, for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy.&#8221; This signifies that we, the ones who minister Christ to God as food for God&#8217;s enjoyment, should separate ourselves to be holy unto God.<p>As God&#8217;s priests, we are actually God&#8217;s &#8220;cooks.&#8221; For us to offer Christ to God means that we &#8220;cook&#8221; Christ as God&#8217;s food for His satisfaction. We need to eat, and God also needs to eat. We eat what He cooks for us, and He eats what we cook for Him. As God&#8217;s cooks, we should be a holy people, a people undefiled, so that we would not profane the name of our holy God.<h2 class=head2>D. Being Pure in Marriage</h2><p>Verses 7 and 9 tell us that the priests were to be pure in marriage. This signifies that we, the New Testament priests, should be pure in our closest human relationship. We must be pure in this relationship in order to keep the status of the holy priesthood.<h2 class=head2>E. Having the Anointing Oil for the Priesthood</h2><p>Verse 10a speaks of the priest &#8220;on whose head the anointing oil has been poured.&#8221; This signifies that we, the New Testament priests, have the anointing Spirit for our priestly service. We have been anointed with the all-inclusive Spirit. Today this Spirit is not only within us but also upon us for our priestly service.<h2 class=head2>F. Wearing the Garments of Consecration of the Priesthood</h2><p>Verse 10b speaks of the priest &#8220;who has been consecrated to wear the garments.&#8221; This signifies that we should live a life that befits our priestly service.<p>Here &#8220;consecrated&#8221; actually means inaugurated. In Exodus 29 we see that when the priests were inaugurated, they were clothed with priestly garments, and from that time onward the priests wore the garments of their consecration. Garments signify our living, our conduct. For us as God&#8217;s priests today to wear the garments of consecration is for us to have a living that befits our priesthood.<h2 class=head2>G. Not Disheveling the Head</h2><p>According to verse 10c, the priest was not to dishevel his head. This signifies that we should not be disobedient, unrestrained, or disorderly in our actions. Speaking typo-logically, we should keep our hair in good order and thereby show that we submit to God&#8217;s headship, that we submit to our God in His authority. Furthermore, we should be restrained in our walk, especially in our speaking. It is wrong to speak in a loose way without restraint. One who walks in the holiness of God is one who is continually ruled by God&#8217;s presence. Hence, he is orderly in his daily walk. In all that we do and say, we should be in good order.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_172.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_174.html">Next</a> </body></html>
