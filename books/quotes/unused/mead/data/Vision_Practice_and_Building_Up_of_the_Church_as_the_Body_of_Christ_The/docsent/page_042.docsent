   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE GROWTH IN LIFE AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOUL Scripture Reading: Eph 2:21-22; 4:14-16; 1 Pet 2:2-5; Gen 2:9; Rev 21:18-21; Matt 13:1-33; 44-46; 1 Cor 3:9-12; Rev 22:2; 21:2; Rom 12:2</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building up of the church depends on our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without the growth in life there is no possibility for the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The building up is also by the transformation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not only by our being cleansed to deal with the negative things but also by our being transformed positively in our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, the building up is in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>BY THE GROWTH OF LIFE Our Growth in Life Being</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>for the Building Up of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians 2:21-22 says, In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word growing is the key word of verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The way to become the temple of God is by growing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 22 the key phrase is in spirit, which has no article in Greek, as some versions render.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The dwelling place of God is in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These two matters growing and in spirit are the basic factors for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verses 11 through 16 of chapter 4 are one long sentence joined by several connecting words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 11 says, And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord as the Head gave all the gifted persons to His Body as gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are gifts not of ability but of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the gifted persons given as gifts are for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ v. 12 . Verses 13 and 14 continue, Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here Paul speaks not of the wind of heresy but the wind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not think that only heresy is a blowing wind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even sound, fundamental, and scriptural teaching can become a blowing wind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 15 says, But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The truth here is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We hold Christ as the truth, the reality, and grow up into Him not only in one thing but also in all things, in all aspects, and in all directions of our life, in all that we are in our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 16 concludes, Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This verse again tells us that the growth in life is for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Peter 2:2-3 says, As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 23 of chapter 1 speaks of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In regeneration we were reborn as spiritual babes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now as the newborn babes we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have tasted that the Lord is good, we will truly desire to take the milk of the Word that we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verses 4 and 5 of chapter 2 tell us the purpose for the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These verses say, Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The holy priesthood is the spiritual house built up by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Two Lines of Life and Building</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>in the Scriptures Israel as the Fig, the Olive,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>the Vine, and the Wheat</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are two lines in the Scriptures: life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Genesis 2, at the very beginning, there was the tree of life v. 9 . A tree is for growth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Immediately following this, verses 11 and 12 speak of precious materials: gold, bdellium, and onyx.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To see what precious materials are for, we need to come to the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Revelation 21 we see a city built up with gold, pearl, and precious stones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the precious materials are for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the people of God in the Old Testament, Israel is often compared to a tree or a crop.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Israel is likened to a fig tree, an olive tree, and a wild vine Jer 24:2, 5, 8; 11:16; Psa 52:8; 80:8, 14; Isa 5:2; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Figs and olives are for eating, and the vine produces wine for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the people of God are likened to something for food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, in Luke 10 the good Samaritan poured oil and wine on the wounds of a man who had been beaten v. 34 . Here oil and wine are not for food but as medicine to heal the wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what the people of God must be.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The people of God are fig trees to produce food, olive trees for oil, and the vine to produce wine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are for satisfying people and for healing them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In addition, the people of Israel are also wheat to produce fine flour and cakes for the meal offering to satisfy God Lev 2:1-2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The thought of the Scriptures is that the people of God are either a tree or a crop.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the aspect of growth.</S>
