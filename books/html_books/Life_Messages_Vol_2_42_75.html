In order to carry out His purpose, He has a way or an economy. God&#8217;s economy, that is, His way of achieving His eternal purpose, is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. We are among those chosen by God for His purpose. Let us consider the place of God&#8217;s Word in His economy.<h2 class=head1>THE BIBLE ALONE</h2><p>In order to realize the importance of God&#8217;s Word in His economy, we must understand that among the various religions on the earth, no book except the Bible can be called the Word of God. No religion has the Word of God. Yes, the Moslems have the Koran, but that is largely an imitation of the Old Testament and a little part of the New Testament. As for the writings of Hinduism and Buddhism, those writings are simply devilish.<p>On the whole earth the Bible stands alone as the Word of God. It is logical and full of wisdom. It is practical, clear, inspiring, and transparent. It is the word spoken by God and was ordained by Him to be put into a readable, understandable form.<h2 class=head1>GRASPING THE ABSTRACT</h2><p>Because God is abstract and mysterious, it is hard to understand Him. Catholicism introduced images in an attempt to help people understand what would otherwise be hard to grasp. But God has not given us figures, like images or idols. What He has given is the Word. Although He is mysterious, He makes Himself clear in His Word. Yes, the Spirit is mysterious and hard to grasp, but we do have the Word, which is solid, readable, and understandable. The black and white word is also accurate; it leaves little room for argument.<p>Suppose since Pentecost there had been no Bible among the human race. What would there be on earth today? You may say, Don&#8217;t we have the Spirit? Yes, we do, but without the Bible the Spirit would be a delusion. The period when the Bible was locked up by the Catholic Church was the darkest age in human history. Martin Luther not only recovered justification by faith; it was he who unlocked and released the Bible. Four hundred years ago the Bible became a freed book. It is the Word of God which has kept the things of God on the earth. Satan today subtly tries to keep people from the Bible. Christians may have a Bible on their bookshelf at home, or once a week they may have it in their hands, but when they open its pages, very little light can they see. Most Christians today are in darkness because they do not read and understand the Word.<p>The Triune God is revealed in the Word. He has created the universe. He has been incarnated and has passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living. The all-inclusive death of Christ, His resurrection, and ascension have all been accomplished. All these things our God has passed through. There is nothing left undone. In eternity past our God was without creation and without incarnation. But now the universe has been created. Even more, the very Creator has entered into His creatures through incarnation. He has experienced human living; He has been to the cross and died there; He has entered into resurrection; and He has even ascended to the heavens. Now He has returned to the earth as the Spirit who gives life. This is the very God whom we worship and whom we have received.<p>But these matters are abstract; how can we grasp them? The Lord knows our situation. Therefore He has spoken and has had His word written down. Now this book is in our hand.<h2 class=head1>A SEED</h2><p>The Bible illustrates that the word of God is like a seed (Matt. 13:23). Within a seed there is a life concealed. A seed appears to be merely something physical, but inside is something abstract and mysterious. The life cannot be seen, but if that seed is sown into the earth, it will sprout, blossom, and bring forth fruit. This growth is the expression of the life of the seed. The word in the Bible is like a seed, conveying God Himself as life to you. Sow this Word into yourself and after a while, life will spring up within you. It will grow, blossom, and bear fruit.<p>What is the position of God&#8217;s Word in His economy? It is the embodiment of God. Where is God today? He is in the Word. When we preach the gospel, we preach the Word. In Ephesians 1:13 it is called &#8220;the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation.&#8221; The gospel of our salvation is the word of the truth. Within the Word is God Himself with His salvation.<p>Now that you are saved, you must day by day contact God. You cannot do this by closing your eyes and meditating. If you try meditating, you will find that you are off on a journey around the world! To meet God, open the Bible. God is there! It is not superstitious to say this. God is in the Word. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&#8221; (John 6:63). It is not too much to say that a seed is life, because the life is within it. In the same way, we may say that the word of the Bible is Spirit, because within the Word, the substance or essence is God Himself who is Spirit. To come to the Word is to come to God Himself.<h2 class=head1>FINDING GOD IN THE WORD</h2><p>If you do not open yourself and exercise your spirit, however, your coming to the Word may be in vain. You should not read the Bible as though it were a newspaper. God, even so, is merciful, and many times people have opened the Bible with no intention of finding God. He nonetheless has met them.<p>Before he was saved, one of my co-workers considered Christianity as a foolish, Western religion. He was a member of a political party and a leading young man in his district. In his thought China already had Confucius&#8217; teaching; it did not need a foreign religion from the West! One day he went into a Buddhist temple. For some strange reason, there on the table for worship was a large opened Bible. Who had put it there he did not know, but he recognized it as the Bible of that Western religion which he despised. Being curious, he wanted to see what the book said. It was opened to Psalm 1. He read it and was most surprised. How could that Western religion have something better than Confucius? He stole the Bible from the temple and took it home with him.<p>One day, having some leisure time, he thought to himself, &#8220;Let me take a look at that Bible.&#8221; As he was reading it, he met God, or rather, God met him. He realized he was a sinner, though always before he had been self-righteous. Though he had never heard the gospel nor been to any Christian meeting, he repented, weeping and even rolling on the ground.<p>That young man was thoroughly saved and eventually became one of our co-workers. Here, then, is a case of someone who was saved simply through the Word. Wherever the Word is, if the environment is conducive, life comes out. This is to say that the Spirit comes out. The Spirit in the Word springs up in life.<p>The Bible, then, is where we can touch God. How do you know that God became a man? that Jesus as God lived on this earth in human flesh? that He died on the cross for you? that you have been crucified with Christ? that you have been seated with Him in the heavenlies? All this you know because the Bible says so. If you reject the Bible, that is like throwing away God and all His accomplishments, including redemption, salvation, and life.<h2 class=head1>BEING FILLED BY THE WORD</h2><p>Keep coming to the Word. Even if you read it more than a hundred times, you will not be bored. Each time it has a fresh supply for you. This is the place to touch God. The Pentecostalists may say that you can experience Him by speaking in tongues. I tried that way for a year and a half but did not get much result. From my experience I would say that the best way to be filled in spirit is to get into the Word. You may feel like a flat tire, but the Bible is the pump. It will fill you with pneuma! Fasting will not fill you; I have seen people try that. The more they fasted, the flatter they were.<p>If you &#8220;let the word of Christ dwell in you richly&#8221; (Col. 3:16), the result will be &#8220;singing with grace in your hearts to God.&#8221; The parallel passage in Ephesians 5:18-19 tells us, &#8220;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&#8221; The Word that fills you becomes the Spirit.<p>&#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&#8221; (John 14:23). To have the Triune God abide with you, you need to keep His word. It is His word also which is the truth that sanctifies us (17:17).<p>I encourage you all to read the Word three times a day. If you have been reading it for ten minutes every morning, I am sure you have found how rich it is and that ten minutes is not sufficient. Dear saints, get into the Word. You will see what a difference it makes.<p>As you read, pray. Pray in a very living way, using what you read as your prayer. In this way you will take the Word into you and receive a life supply. Its riches will satisfy you not just day by day, but year after year as well. All the rich help is here in the Word. Christians all too often are looking for outside help; they want others to come and help them. But all the riches are right in the Word; this is the place to turn for help. Do not expect magical results, though; just come regularly three times a day and you will receive the supply you need.<h2 class=head1>PREACHING AND TEACHING THE WORD</h2><p>We have tried different ways of getting an increase, but they have not been successful. The best way is to preach and teach the Word. Have you ever tried teaching your parents for an hour? You have to be prepared to say something reasonable, perhaps like this:<p>&#8220;Dad, you are older and have had more experience than I have had. Can you tell me what the purpose of human life is?&#8221; Then, because you are so familiar with the Word and have it always in your pocket, you can tell him what the Bible declares is man&#8217;s purpose. He may be impressed and ask you where you learned that. Then you can say, &#8220;From the Bible, Dad. Ephesians chapters one and three.&#8221;<p>Another time you may say to your parents, &#8220;Dad and Mom, did you know there are three wills in the universe?&#8221; When they ask, &#8220;What three wills?&#8221; you can tell them about the divine will, the satanic will, and the human will. Even if they oppose you, they may find your talk so interesting that they will listen. Whether they will buy your cargo is up to them, but you have to try to sell it! Present it in an attractive brochure, not too short. An hour&#8217;s speech is about right.<p>You need to do this on the campus too. If you try to get people to call on the Lord, if you tell them Christianity is all wrong, or if you say the Lord&#8217;s recovery is the only thing that matters, people will think you are mentally off. You need to learn to teach others in an attractive way.<h2 class=head1>A MEETING FOR TEACHING AND PREACHING</h2><p>First of all, you must study the Word. Then it would be good for the churches to have training meetings, a &#8220;teaching and preaching&#8221; meeting where people can hear the truths of the Bible in an atmosphere of preaching. If this is held on the Lord&#8217;s Day mornings, relatives and friends can be invited, and eventually others also will be encouraged to come. This meeting is not for the shallow gospel, but for the broadened gospel, covering a span from eternity to eternity. Such a meeting will be a place where your acquaintances can come and hear the truth. I believe this way is based upon the principles in the New Testament. The apostles in the book of Acts just preached and taught the Word.<p>How does this differ from what Christianity practices? First of all, their sermons often do not give the real truth from the Bible. Secondly, they usually have hired, professional preachers, teaching the laymen. Thirdly, their teachings are all too often without much reality.<p>Our intention is not to have two or three brothers do all the preaching. All of us must be the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers. It is not too much to say that we must all be apostles. Apostle does not refer to a position; it simply means sent one. &#8220;As the Father has sent Me, I also send you&#8221; (John 20:21). The Lord was speaking to all the disciples when He said this, not only the apostles. Every believer, then, should be a sent one. If you go to your parents to speak for God to them, you are a sent one. Then, when you speak for God to them, you become His spokesman or prophet. What is it that you speak? It is the good tidings. This makes you an evangelist as well. When some people receive the gospel and become believers, you take care of them. This means you are a shepherd too. You may even shepherd your parents, if they receive the word you spoke to them as an evangelist and as a prophet when you were God&#8217;s sent one. Finally, you may teach them from Genesis 2 about the tree of life and the woman built up from Adam&#8217;s rib. If you are all faithful like this, within a few years the whole town may be turned to Christ!<p>Let us love the Lord and come to Him to fellowship with Him by reading His Word and praying. Day by day live this way. You will have experiences of Him and also learn the teachings with the enlightenment. Then gather for the church meetings. In this meeting not just a few leading ones should speak. The elders take the lead. You must all do what the elders do. Whatever they speak, you speak. You follow and learn from them. Such meetings will be attractive, convincing, and subduing. In this way you will get the proper knowledge and enlightenment.<p>This will lead to increase. Among your neighbors and friends will be some who will see your way of living. They will notice that you have the truth and know how to speak, preach, and teach. Behind the scenes pray for a few of them. God will answer your prayer; He will move according to the tracks you have laid for Him in prayer. He is the way. There is no need to arrange and organize some program. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery all we need is the Triune God and the Bible. We can take Him in through the Bible, and we can pray. This is the way we live.<h2 class=head1>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2><p><I>We have many dear friends in Christianity or in the world, and when we first came into the church we damaged many of them by sharing in a wrong way. As you say, we do need to pray and go to the Word, but I still would like some practical help as to what to do for these whom we have damaged.</I><p>The best way to heal this situation is to pray for the ones you damaged. Do not initiate anything. Contact the Lord and follow Him. As you do so, you will know His mind. He may lead you to go to some of them, not only to become reconciled but also to say a word about God&#8217;s economy to them. If the Lord leads, you go. If not, do not go.<p>Do not feel that because you did some damage, you must try to set matters right. Do not initiate anything with that in mind. Simply follow the Lord&#8217;s leading. Do not go to others with the intention of correcting some damage you may have caused. To do so is to play politics. If you go, you do so because you are led of the Lord. You have no choice but to be one with Him. You do not care for the result but simply follow Him because you are one with Him.<p>This should be your attitude regardless of how many you have damaged. All the past is under the blood and is gone. Now is a new day. As the Lord moves, you move. What He does you do. You are one with Him. The past is over. The future you do not know. You have only today. We Christians do not live in tomorrow nor in yesterday. We have only today.<p><I>There are two schools of thought on preaching the gospel. One is to be burdened, pray, and go as the Lord leads. The other is to be instant in season and out of season. Could you say something about this?</I><p>These two are one. If you keep contacting the Lord, you will find that you are preaching all the time. But if you neglect contacting the Lord and take up the exhortation to be instant in season and out of season (2 Tim. 4:2), you will be keeping a regulation. This would be religious; that is, you would be doing something for God without Christ&#8217;s leading. When we keep contacting the Lord and live with Him, we shall spontaneously preach the gospel. The Lord says, &#8220;He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit&#8221; (John 15:5). If you abide, surely you will bear fruit. If you do not bear fruit, it means you are not abiding. Yet if you try to bear fruit without abiding, that is your doing and becomes religious.<p>God&#8217;s economy is a matter of life. You may compare it to the physical body. For a person to breathe, he has to be living. If you try to breathe yet you do not have life, you are seeking to fulfill a requirement. But when you are living, you breathe unconsciously, whatever else you are doing. You may be busy and not notice that you are breathing, but nonetheless the breathing goes on. In the same way, if you abide in the Lord (have life), you will bear fruit (breathe).<p>There is no point in talking about someone&#8217;s physical problems if he is no longer alive. Doctors prescribe medication based upon the fact of your being alive. Once you are dead, they can do nothing to help. Medication has no effect if you are dead. Surgery too would be useless. Many times a surgeon will not operate if the patient is weak. Even if the surgery was well done, without the support of the patient&#8217;s life, it would be in vain.<p>Life is what matters in the church life too. Christianity may maneuver, arrange, and organize, but in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we have seen that where there is life, there is no need for so many plans and schedules. The body does not plan what it will do and say during the day. As long as it is alive, all its members function spontaneously in a good coordination. In our life with the Lord, we contact Him by reading His Word and praying and by being one with Him all day long. We do not need to anticipate anything nor regulate ourselves. Let us simply live Christ the way the branches abide in the vine.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>SOME BASIC ITEMS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h1><h2 class=head1>SOME BASIC ITEMS IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>The Gospel of John occupies a special place in God&#8217;s revelation. It is a book much loved by Christians. I myself have been studying it since 1925. In this message I would like us to consider some of the key verses, in order that we might realize the particular characteristic of this book.<p>Notice the simple words with which it opens: &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; Even a young child can read these words, yet who can understand them? What was the beginning? Why does it say that the Word, rather than God, was in the beginning?<p>John opens with the Word. Then at the end of the book, there is the breath. &#8220;And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (20:22). Between the opening verse on the Word and the final item of the breath, many matters are covered.<h2 class=head1>INCARNATION</h2><p>God is here, for &#8220;the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; Life is also here, for &#8220;In Him was life&#8221; (1:4). Flesh is here, for &#8220;the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&#8221; (v. 14). Flesh here means man. In fact, as Genesis 6:3 indicates, flesh means fallen man.<p>There are two great events which transpired in the history of the universe. The first was creation. Before creation, there was nothing but God Himself. When the time came, God brought all things into existence. But God was apart from all the things which He created. He was not in the sun or moon, nor was He in the trees or animals. He created them, but He was outside of them.<p>With the second great event, however, the story is different. This was the incarnation, when God became flesh. The incarnation was not to bring the universe into existence out of nothing; rather, it was to bring God into the existing man.<p>There was a man by the name of Jesus with whom was God. From the time this One lived on earth, God was no longer outside His creatures. He had entered into man. Jesus is both God and man. He is a God-man.<h2 class=head1>FULLNESS</h2><p>Another matter covered in John is fullness. &#8220;Of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace&#8221; (1:16). Fullness means everything that God is. It includes all the divine attributes, all the human virtues, and all the supplies for life. God is rich and full. Out of this fullness we all received. Have you received something of God? It is one thing to learn something of God, but another to receive something of Him. How much have you received? Grace upon grace. Your receiving has not ended yet. Day by day you continue to receive out of His fullness.<h2 class=head1>DRINKING AND WORSHIP</h2><p>In John 4 there is the water that wells up. If you drink this water, it will well up into eternal life. The water pertains to the Spirit. The drinking in verse 14 is the worshipping in verse 24. You drink by worshipping. The water in verse 14 is the Spirit in verse 24. To drink the water is to take in the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE BREAD OF LIFE</h2><p>In chapter six there is the bread of life. With the bread there is the eating (vv. 35, 50, 57). There is the water for drinking and the bread for eating. The bread of life is in the Spirit. &#8220;It is the Spirit Who gives life; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&#8221; (v. 63). Here is the life-giving Spirit and also the word that is the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>RIVERS OF LIVING WATER</h2><p>In John 7:37-39 the matter of drinking is mentioned again. Instead of just a fountain springing up, there are rivers. When the water flowing from the spring becomes a river, the riches of the water can be seen. When many rivers converge, there is a flood. As you enjoy the Lord, you will flow rivers of water. There will be a river of love, another of humility, another of light, and another of kindness. When you first begin coming to the church meetings, you flow just a small river, but in time the rivers will become a flood. When you open your mouth, the whole meeting will be flooded by you. Eventually the church meetings will become an ocean, as we all express the riches of Christ. &#8220;I came that they may have life and have it abundantly&#8221; (10:10).<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD DISPENSED INTO US</h2><p>In 14:17 it says &#8220;the Spirit of reality...abides with you and shall be in you.&#8221; Verse 20 goes on to say, &#8220;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&#8221; This means that the Triune God has dispensed Himself into us and that now we are in Him. Verse 23 says further, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; These profound words say that the Father and the Lord Jesus will not simply come to visit us but will actually come to live in us and settle down. The text implies not only that we shall become the abode of the Triune God, but also that He will be our abode. The word abode here is mutual. We shall be His abiding place, and He will be ours.<p>Here is the divine dispensation, in a different realm entirely from religion, ethics, or morality. It is not only salvation, according to our poor understanding, but the Triune God working Himself into our being, making us His abode, and making Himself our abode.<h2 class=head1>ABIDING</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus in the next chapter, John 15, tells His disciples, &#8220;I am the vine, you are the branches....Abide in Me,&#8221; He is simply continuing the thought of the mutual abiding from the previous chapter. This One abiding in us is Jesus Christ, whose very name is Wonderful (Isa. 9:6). He is very God and very man. Could you imagine that it is possible to abide in God? Herein is the best enjoyment. I can testify this to you after fifty-four years of experience. Is it not marvelous that even now we are abiding in God? How poor is the thought that someday we are going to heaven! Right now God is abiding in us!<p>If you think it is too mysterious that God abides in you, notice verse 7, where it says, &#8220;You abide in Me and My words abide in you.&#8221; This you can understand. The word of the Bible abides in you. This is solid and tangible.<h2 class=head1>BREATHING</h2><p>Then we come to the last point we mentioned, that of the Lord&#8217;s breathing into His disciples. By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself as life into them.<h2 class=head1>DRINKING, EATING, AND BREATHING</h2><p>If we consider these various items covered in John, we realize how vital they are for our existence. Without drinking, eating, and breathing we could not live.<p>These three means for our physical existence are all used by the Lord Jesus to illustrate how we may take Him. He is our water, more refreshing than the best earthly drink. We must drink Him!<p>He is our bread. We must eat Him! Bread is not merely to be looked at. Its purpose is to be eaten. This living bread must be eaten. Do not think that to say this is uncultured and wild. He says Himself that we must eat Him.<p>He is our breath, imparting Himself as life to us. We must breathe Him!<p>This enjoyment of Jesus is God&#8217;s economy. It is this that He would recover among His people. Jesus is the living water, the living bread, and the living breath. We must drink of Him, eat Him, and breathe Him.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO TAKE CHRIST IN</h2><p>There are two ways by which we may drink, eat, and breathe Jesus. These are the Word and the Spirit. &#8220;It is the Spirit Who gives life; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&#8221; (John 6:63). This verse mentions both the Word and the Spirit. The very Word revealed in John 1:1 eventually became the Spirit. It is this Spirit who is the water, the bread, and the breath.<p>John 20:22 reads, &#8220;Receive the Holy pneuma.&#8221; This Greek word pneuma may be translated either as spirit or as breath. It is equally correct to say, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; or &#8220;Receive the holy breath.&#8221; The Spirit today is our breath. This breath is Jesus, the incarnate Word who went to the cross, entered into resurrection, and ascended to the heavens. He then returned to us as the life-giving Spirit.<p>We have the Word outside us and the Spirit inside us. Day by day we must come to the Word, not only with our mind but also with our heart and spirit. As we open the Bible, we must open our whole being. We must read not only with our understanding but also with prayer. The Bible is not an ordinary book. In this holy Word there is life, the Spirit, God, and Jesus Christ. These are all contained in the Word and are conveyed to us as we open ourselves and pray. This prayerful reading of the Word is the eating, drinking, and breathing in of the Lord.<p>How would you answer if someone asked you where God is? Do not say that God is in the heavens. Heaven is too far away. How could one get there to find Him? God, you must tell him, is in the Bible. Where is Christ? He also is in the Word. Where is the Spirit? Where is life? The answer to these two questions is also &#8220;in the Word.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE WORD AS A SEED</h2><p>If you plant a little stone or a piece of rock in the soil, nothing will come up, even if you wait for twenty years. On the other hand, if you sow a tiny seed into the soil, in just a matter of days it will sprout. This sprouting proves that the seed contains life.<p>Where is life to be found? It is found in a seed. Did you know that the word of God in the Bible is a seed? &#8220;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever&#8221; (1 Pet. 1:23). The word in the Bible is a seed, conveying life. What, then, is the soil? Our heart is the soil. We must open our heart to receive the Word just as the soil must be opened to receive the seed. What is the water? The Spirit is the water. When we come to the Bible and open ourselves, the very seed of the Word gets into us. The more you pray, breathing the air, the more the Spirit as the water is added to you. The air of prayer mingled with the water of the Spirit produces the dew. Much dew becomes a river.<p>This is the Christian life. There is a seed, planted in the soil of your heart, and watered by the Spirit. It sprouts and grows till the blossom appears and the fruit comes. The reason Christ can be the water, the bread of life, and the breath is that He is the life-giving Spirit. He is the Spirit, compounded with divinity, humanity, human living, the death of the cross, resurrection, and ascension. All these are wrapped up in this life-giving Spirit. And you can find Him in the Bible!<h2 class=head1>SPENDING TIME IN THE WORD</h2><p>Spend time with this book. Besides your ten minutes in the morning, take a few more minutes at noon, and a few more in the evening. As you open this book, open yourself also. Read, understand, and pray. As you pray, you are drinking the water, eating the food, and breathing the air. You will grow. The more you take Christ into you in this way, the more Christ you will have growing in you. You will become another person. Do not expect quick results; growth takes time. It does not come about from a few concentrated days of praying and fasting and then having something fall upon you from the heavens. Take time to water the little seed of life sown into the soil of your heart. Not only will you grow; the church will also grow and be built up in this way. In the church meetings Christ will come forth in the teaching, the preaching, and the testifying. Such riches in the church life will convince and attract new ones.<h2 class=head1>REGULAR GROWTH</h2><p>Do not be concerned about how much you understand of what you read. What matters is that you faithfully open the Word, open yourself, and read and pray. This is not a once-for-all procedure. It is not like being born, but like breathing. Growth, like breathing, is continual, day by day and even minute by minute. You will grow by coming regularly to the Word. Carry a pocket version of the Word with you. Wherever you are, when you have a few minutes, open it and read a chapter or so, then pray over what you have read. There is little need for you to pray about your grades at school, or for your business to be successful, or for guidance when you go shopping. Simply pray the Word. In this way you will receive and enjoy God Himself.<h2 class=head1>PRAYING THE WORD</h2><p>What do you think makes you healthy and strong? It is by eating, drinking, and breathing. When it gets close to meal time you probably feel weak; you need to eat to regain your energy. The same is true spiritually. You are weak if you have not been eating, drinking, and breathing Christ in the Word. In fact, it is a mercy that you are still here. Do not try to run the race without food, drink, and air any longer! Come to the Word. Open to the Lord. Speak to Him the words you read. &#8220;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. Lord, thank You, You are the Word. You became flesh. Thank You that You tabernacled among us. Among us! Amen. Full of grace. Hallelujah, grace! Grace and truth. Amen, grace and truth! Of His fullness we all received. We all received. We have received, Lord, and we are receiving even now. Praise the Lord!&#8221; Does praying the Word in this way seem like foolishness to you? I tell you, it is the way to eat, drink, and breathe Christ. This is how we can live Christ, rather than living morality or ethics. Read and pray the Word!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WIDE SCOPE OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h1><h2 class=head1>THE WIDE SCOPE OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>God became a man with the intention that man might receive Him, that He might become man&#8217;s life, and that man might be one to express Him. This is the message of the Gospel of John.<p>I hope you do not have the shallow concept of the gospel that is so prevalent today. The common teaching is that we were pitiful sinners on the way to hell but that God loved us and sent His Son to be our Redeemer. The Son died on the cross, was resurrected from the dead, and is now in heaven. We must believe in Him in order to be saved. Then some day we shall go to heaven and have a good time for eternity. If this is your view of the gospel, you are missing the mark.<h2 class=head1>THE GOOD NEWS</h2><p>The word gospel means good news or glad tidings. The New Testament gospel is that God one day became man, the man Jesus. He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. Consider what a restriction it was to the infinite God to be confined in man for so many years. He lived in a poor carpenter&#8217;s home in a despised town. After thirty years He came out to minister, not in a vast country but in the Holy Land, a narrow tract of land only three hundred by one hundred miles in size. God lived in a small country, in a small town, and in a small home.<p>When He was thirty-three, He went to the cross. There He terminated the old generation, the old creation, and the old man. He abolished death. He took away all natural differences. When He entered into death, He conquered and subdued it. In other words, He conquered the power of darkness, the despot Satan. He entered into death and then emerged from it in resurrection.<h2 class=head2>Flesh and Spirit</h2><p>It was at this point that He became the life-giving Spirit. The Bible uses the word became twice in reference to this wonderful Person who actually was God. He &#8220;became flesh&#8221; (John 1:14) and walked here on earth. Then He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45, Gk.). As God He became flesh; as flesh He became the life-giving Spirit. The interval of time between the two &#8220;becames&#8221; was about thirty-four years.<h2 class=head2>Creation and Incarnation</h2><p>In eternity past, before Genesis 1, there was only God Himself. Then He created the universe, bringing it into being out of nothing. When He spoke, &#8220;Let there be...,&#8221; there was. How long the time was between creation and incarnation the Bible does not tell us. But we do need to be aware that God firstly accomplished creation out of nothing and then passed through incarnation, through which He became one with His creature man.<h2 class=head2>A Model Life</h2><p>The human life Jesus lived on this earth is beyond our understanding. He set up a model of the life that God wants. God does not want moral, ethical, or religious living. The four Gospels display a life of God mingled with man, a life expressing God. This model life is called the truth (John 1:17; Eph. 4:21). It is the reality of God manifested in humanity.<h2 class=head2>All Things Accomplished</h2><p>After He had set up this pattern, Christ went through death and resurrection to become the Spirit in order that He might enter into us. It is only as the Spirit that He can be received into us. After resurrection He ascended into the heavens to assume His position. There as a man He was enthroned, crowned, and made Lord and Head of all. This very One came down on the day of Pentecost and is still with us.<p>All God&#8217;s intention has already been realized. There is nothing which has not been accomplished. When were we reborn? It was when Jesus was resurrected. When were we crucified? It was when Jesus was crucified. When were the local churches brought forth? It was not when we began to meet around the Lord&#8217;s table, but when Jesus was resurrected from the dead. In His resurrection and ascension the church has been produced, and we have been brought to the heavens.<p>Not only has this One accomplished all God&#8217;s purpose; He Himself includes His accomplishments. The incarnation is in Him. The human living as a pattern is in Him. Death, resurrection, and ascension are in Him. The life-giving Spirit is in Him. He is a composition of whatever He has accomplished. His accomplishments are components of Him,<p>When we receive this Christ into us, we receive creation, incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension into us. He is an all-inclusive drink. To drink of Him as the life-giving Spirit is to drink of the processed Triune God.<p>Such is the scope of the gospel. It extends from eternity past to eternity future.<h2 class=head1>THE FOCUS OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>All things have been accomplished. Our need is to experience this, not to try to accomplish things ourselves. The focus of the gospel is that God comes into us to be everything. We need to experience what He has become, all that He has done, and all that He is.<p>Suppose as your father I prepare everything you need. I grow fruits and vegetables for you. I raise cows, lambs, and chickens so you will have meat. You do not need to produce the crops nor raise the animals. Your job is simply to enjoy all the things I have prepared for you. I can prepare them, but I cannot enjoy them for you. That you must do.<p>This is an inadequate illustration of what the Triune God in the Son and as the Spirit has done. He has accomplished everything needful, and it is now available to us in Him. Our part is to receive, enjoy, and experience. This is the focus of the Gospel of John.<p>John 1:11-12 says, &#8220;He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name.&#8221; The earlier verses tell us how this One came. He came as God, as life, and as light. Verse 14 adds that He came in the flesh and as a tabernacle and that He was full of grace and reality. He came!<p>He came with an expectation that His people would receive Him. But they did not. On His side it was a matter of coming; on our side it is a matter of receiving. He has not only come, but has also accomplished all things by His coming. Now it is up to us to receive Him.<p>Have you received Him? To what extent? In what way? &#8220;Of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace&#8221; (1:16). How much have you received of His fullness? It is vaster than an ocean, but you may have received only four ounces! Paul mentions these limitless dimensions of Christ in Ephesians 3:18-19. His fullness is eternally wide. The concept of the hymnwriter is too small:<p class=hbody>And to an ocean fulness, His mercy doth expand....<p class=hbody>Hymns, #206<p>His fullness far exceeds any global measurement. An ocean is a poor comparison! Who can measure the breadth and length and height and depth of the fullness we received? And we received grace upon grace.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY TO RECEIVE OF HIS FULLNESS</h2><p>His fullness comes to us in two ways: by the Word and by the Spirit. We can liken this to electricity with its two wires, the antenna and the ground wire. The Spirit is the antenna, and the Word is the ground. These are the two lines that convey the heavenly electricity, which is Christ Himself, the life-giving Spirit. He is brought into the house, our being, by means of these two wires, the Spirit and the Word.<p>If you read the Gospel of John carefully, you will notice that at the beginning Christ is presented as the Word; then toward the end He becomes the Spirit (20:22). As the Word He is the ground wire; He came down to us. As the Spirit He is the antenna. These two, the Word and the Spirit, are brought together in John 6:63: &#8220;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&#8221; When the antenna and the ground wire become one, the electricity comes. When the Word and the Spirit are intertwined, Christ is conveyed into us.<p>How can we receive Christ? We must read the Word and touch the Spirit. Then we have both the antenna and the ground wire. This brings the heavenly electricity. With the Word as the ground wire and the Spirit as the antenna, all the riches of Christ will be transmitted to us.<p>This receiving is not once for all. It began when we believed in the Lord Jesus, receiving Him as our Savior. It should continue all day long, every day, along these two wires. I trust that by our considering the Gospel of John together in this way, your appetite for the Word has been stirred up. Several times every day come to the Word. Pray over it. Understand and receive it. Read it and love it.<h2 class=head1>STUDYING THE WORD</h2><p>I hope we shall eventually have the whole New Testament in the Recovery Version. For the present you can study the books we have already finished. If you will use them, they will save you much time and effort. It has taken a great deal of research and many hours to compile them. We have checked interlinear translations, lexicons, concordances, and many other translations. By using the Recovery Version of the books we have completed, you will get all the benefit of our efforts. It will save you from studying too much on your own; studying is sometimes a frustration to the Spirit.<p>Especially read John, Romans, Hebrews, Ephesians, Colossians, and Revelation. Leave Matthew aside at first; that is a hard book. Besides your morning reading of a few verses, spend some other time to delve into these books. One way to study them is to notice the key words. In John, for example, pay attention to the word came. Then consider the word receive. Our receiving will last even to eternity, because we shall still have the water of life to drink and the tree of life to eat of.<h2 class=head1>AN ORGANIC RECEIVING</h2><p>How do we receive this Triune God? It is first by believing into Him, then by drinking, eating, and breathing Him. Drinking and eating are the best ways to receive, but the fastest is by breathing. These are the three means of receiving what is organic. To accept something that is handed to you is not an organic receiving. But drinking, eating, and breathing are; they cause a metabolic change.<p>You must read the Word. You cannot drink without something to drink. You cannot eat without food. You cannot breathe if there is no air. The water, the food, and even the air are all in the Word. Come to the Word at least three times a day. You must build up this habit. As you get older, you will be grateful that you did.<h2 class=head1>MEETING TOGETHER</h2><p>The Word will make you grow and experience the riches of Christ. Then you will be impelled into the church life. The word ecclesia, which we translate church, means a called-out congregation. Without meeting together or congregating there can be no church life. The more meetings we have, the better.<p>Our coming together is not just with ourselves. We come with Christ, with the growth in life, and with the experience of the riches of Christ. This will make our meetings living. Merely to shout &#8220;Praise the Lord!&#8221; may not help the meeting. From the Old Testament we can see that when the children of Israel gathered together, they brought a rich surplus of the produce of the good land. No one could appear there empty-handed (Deut. 16:16). It was not sufficient simply to shout. Of course, they did come singing the psalms of blessing, but singing was not the main factor. They had to bring a surplus of their produce.<p>For us this means that we come to the meetings with the riches of Christ. How full our meeting will be depends on how much we have experienced Him. Our experience of Christ is dependent upon our daily eating of the Word. The Word is our source. Eating of it regularly is basic. Our Christian life and the church life both stem from our being in the Word. If we practice this in a thorough way, every one of us will be a shining light. When we meet together, the church will be strong.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>A LIVING PERSON, NOT ANY SUBSTITUTE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14; 6:63; 14:23; 15:7; 2 Cor. 3:17-18</h1><p>Christ is the Head, and the church is His Body. Together they are one person. The Bible, from its first page to its last, reveals this person. The head and the body are not two separate entities. When the Lord said, &#8220;I am the vine, you are the branches&#8221; (John 15:5), He was saying that He and we are one living item. The stem and the branches are included in each other. The meaning of this oneness of the vine and the branches is the focus of the entire divine revelation in the Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE LESSON OF HISTORY</h2><p>Human history has already passed through six thousand years. This is not a short time. All of history testifies to one thing. That one thing is the need of Christ. Why, for example, was religion invented? It was because man lacked Christ. He was short of God.<p>Genesis 4 makes this quite plain. When Cain was driven out of the presence of God and thus lost God, he and his descendants began to invent things (vv. 16, 20-22). Jubal, for example, was &#8220;the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.&#8221; The invention of music includes entertainment, like dancing, singing, and sports. Why is it that people are so attracted to nightclubs, concerts, and such? It is because they lack Christ.<p>For us God is our entertainment. He is our joy. He is our enjoyment. The Lord is our song. Moses said, &#8220;The Lord is my strength and song&#8221; (Exo. 15:2).<p>Another invention arising out of mankind&#8217;s loss of God was cattle-raising (Gen. 4:20). Jabal was a nomad, dwelling in tents. Because the land would not yield its strength to him, he was forced to be a wanderer and to keep cattle in order to make a living.<p>The making of weaponry was yet another invention to fill the loss of God (4:22). Modern weapons may be more highly developed, but their beginning was soon after Cain &#8220;went out from the presence of the Lord&#8221; (v. 16).<p>In Genesis 11 another invention was brought in, that of religion. At Babel idol worship was introduced. All idols are a replacement of God. If you have God, you do not need idols. God wants man to have only Himself, a living Person.<p>Another replacement for God is ethics. Even one thousand years before Christ was born, the Chinese people had the ethical teachings of Confucius. Ethics may be desirable from society&#8217;s point of view, but such teachings are simply one more invention to fill the shortage in mankind.<p>The jars of humanity are empty because God has been lost. All these inventions are attempts to fill that void.<p>Are you an empty jar? I am no longer empty because I am filled with Christ. I have no need of religion; I have a living Person. I have no need of ethics; I have the living Christ.<h2 class=head1>HIGHER THAN ETHICS</h2><p>This is not to say that we are unethical. If we are given too much change when we buy something, we return the extra amount. If we visit someone, we do not step over the threshold until we are first invited in; otherwise, we would be intruding. Such behavior is higher than ethics. The Lord said that our righteousness must surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, or we are not qualified for the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5:20). What we have is higher than ethics. We have a Person. To live ethically is merely a performance. Our stability, honesty, and faithfulness are not part of a code of ethics. They are Christ.<h2 class=head1>A TROUBLESOME INKPOT</h2><p>This does not mean that I am naturally a good person. When I was a teen-ager, I was working for a large company. One day the place caught on fire, and everything was in confusion. An inkpot on the manager&#8217;s desk attracted my attention. Amidst all the turmoil of moving things, I picked it up and slipped it into my pocket.<p>After I got saved and began to seek after the Lord, the trouble began! I would tell the Lord Jesus that I loved Him, but He seemed to say, &#8220;What about the inkpot?&#8221; When I closed my eyes to pray-inkpot! When I tried to read the Bible-inkpot! When I went to bed at night and tried to sleep-inkpot! I told myself that I must resolve this matter of the inkpot. I looked all over to see if I could find it, but I could not seem to locate it anywhere. After much prayer, I found a way. I sensed within that what I could do would be to take the manager the money to pay for the inkpot. I was happy. I figured out how much it was worth and took the money with me to the manager.<p>On the way there I stopped to buy a calendar with beautiful pictures. (It was New Year&#8217;s time.) Then I went on to the manager&#8217;s. He said, &#8220;My, we haven&#8217;t seen each other for a long time. What brought you to see me?&#8221; He had always considered me a fine young man. My face turned red. The Lord had told me I must not use polished words but confess directly. I answered him, &#8220;I came here because I stole from you.&#8221; I told him the story, then added, &#8220;Now here is the money for the inkpot. I am sorry I cannot return the inkpot, but I think this money will more than cover its cost.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, no, no! An inkpot is a small thing. I don&#8217;t want your money.&#8221; I begged him to take it, telling him I would have no peace if he refused. Then he noticed the calendar and asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; I did not want to talk about the calendar, but I told him what it was. Then he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want your money, but I do like this calendar. I&#8217;ll take this instead of the money.&#8221; I did not like his proposal-I wanted the calendar!-but the Lord said I should go along with what he said. I agreed, thanked him, and left.<p>To tell the truth, I was not happy. Yes, the inkpot problem was gone, but so was my beautiful calendar. On the way home, though, I met another acquaintance. He greeted me and then asked, &#8220;How would you like this calendar?&#8221; It was another calendar. I was so happy I wanted to jump.<h2 class=head1>THE PERSON PRESENTED IN THE WORD</h2><p>We were not good people before we were saved. At that time we did not have Christ. But now we have this living Person. We have no need of religion or ethics. Unfortunately, we as Christians are still under the influence of today&#8217;s religious and ethical concepts. These concepts frustrate our seeing this living Person, even when we come to the Bible. We must drop all such preoccupations and pray, &#8220;Lord, I come to You through Your Word. The Bible is Your Word. I drop my concepts. I want only You.&#8221;<p>What a Person is presented to us in this book! He was the Word. He was God. He became flesh. In Him was life, and this life was the light of men. Does this sound like religion or ethics? When I was young I used to wonder how He could be both God and the Word and how could I take Him as my life. Over the years I have found out that this One is not only the Word, but also the Spirit. &#8220;Now the Lord is that Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17). Then, from John 6:63 we can see that the word is also the Spirit. He is one Person, called the Lord, the Word, and the Spirit. These three are one. The Lord is also life (John 14:6), as are the Word and the Spirit (6:63; Rom. 8:10). The Lord, the Word, the Spirit, and life are four in one.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2><p>We have the Word. The Bible is the Word of God. For two thousand years among the human race, there has been this Word, saving us from confusion, mixture, and darkness. Without it we would have been deluded and led astray. We have this book, which we can read and understand.<p>We have also the Spirit. Suppose all these years we had only had the Word in letter, without the Spirit. We would have been in deadness, even though we might not have been misled.<p>Hallelujah! We have the Word without and the Spirit within. Both are the Lord. Whatever is organic has two aspects. As a human being, for example, we have a physical body without and a human life within. Another example would be a little seed. There is an outward shell and an inward life. You may figure that if there is life, the shell is unnecessary; but without the shell the life would be gone. If, on the other hand, you sow an empty shell into the earth, it will not grow.<p>The Word is the shell. Without the Spirit, it is empty. How wonderful that we have both the Word and the Spirit! Actually, the shell and the life are inseparable. If we open a seed to take out the life, there will be nothing there. Similarly, if we cut someone open to find his life, the life will be gone. Without the Spirit, the Word is lifeless. Without the Word, the Spirit is abstract and intangible. We must have both.<h2 class=head1>FINDING GOD IN THE WORD</h2><p>When we come to the Word, we are not coming to the letter. We must have the deep realization that we are coming to God. We must pray, &#8220;Lord, You are here in Your Word. You are in Your Word, and You are the Word as well as the Spirit.&#8221; Where is God? Yes, He is in the third heaven. Yes, He is within us. These statements are true, but they are not solid. Solidly speaking, God is in the Word. In the Word are also life, love, and light. To receive God, Christ, the Spirit, life, light, and love, we must come to the Word. We must not turn aside from the Word and pray for something to fall upon us from the heavens; this is not the biblical way.<p>The biblical way is to take the Word into you. Then you will be filled. The Word is the embodiment of the Triune God, of Christ, of the Spirit, and of all the divine virtues.<h2 class=head1>THE WRONG WAY TO USE THE WORD</h2><p>Christians have the Bible, but many use it only when they go to their weekly &#8220;worship service.&#8221; The rest of the time it sits on the shelf.<p>There are other Christians who use the Bible like a science textbook. They think they need to know Greek to understand it. They research words like logos and theos and try to figure out the real meaning. If only they had a theological education, it would be such a help! What is the result of this mental approach? &#8220;The letter killeth&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:6). This is the wrong way to touch the Word.<h2 class=head1>THE RIGHT WAY TO COME TO THE WORD</h2><p>When we come to the Word, we need to open four layers of our being. To begin with, we must open our eyes. If they are shut, we cannot read! Then we must open our mind in order to understand what we are reading. But reading and understanding are not enough. We must thirdly open our heart to receive what we read. Lastly, we must open our spirit to realize what we have received.<p>The way to be helped by the Word, then, is to read, understand, receive, and realize. This requires our opening of our eyes, mind, heart, and spirit. The Bible is not a simple book. Reading it profitably involves all four layers of our being.<p>To open these four parts takes an effort. Yes, keeping our eyes open to read is simple. Our mind, however, is another matter. As soon as we sit down to read the Word, our mind takes off on a 747! We must call it back and insist that it concentrate. To open our mind means simply to concentrate on what we are reading. If we do this, we shall uncover what is hidden in the Word.<p>As to opening our heart, we do this by loving the Lord. We may open our mind and pray-read the Word in a superficial way, but if we do not love the Lord, we are drawn off by thoughts of other things we love. When our time in the Word seems dry and lifeless, it may be that our heart is not open to Him to give Him our love.<p>The way to open our spirit, the deepest layer, is by genuine prayer. Once our eyes see, our mind understands, and our heart receives, we can pray the Word into us. Then the Word will become our life supply, bringing to us God, Christ, the Spirit, and all the divine virtues.<h2 class=head1>A REPLACEMENT</h2><p>The result of our opening to the Lord in this fourfold way is that this living One replaces religion, ethics, and our natural virtues. When He comes, all that is not of Him must go.<p>This is the reason it is so urgent that we come to the Word. With the reading, the understanding, the receiving, and the realizing, the Word becomes ours. It will grow and be formed in us. The Lord is both the Word and the Spirit. The Word also is the Spirit. Thus it is that in the Word we find the Lord, the Spirit, and life.<p>Time after time come to this Word, each time opening your eyes, your mind, your heart, and your spirit. Then you will be not only reading, but also understanding, receiving, and realizing. You will grow, and the church will be built up, by this way of life. All the substitutes for Christ will be replaced with Himself.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:8; 4:7, 11-12, 16; John 20:19, 21; Acts 6:4, 7</h1><p>Whenever the children of God gather together, it is a time when God can speak. In the Old Testament God spoke from within the tent of meeting. Without a meeting of God&#8217;s children He would not speak. God&#8217;s oracle comes to the congregation of His people. This was true not only at the time of Moses and Aaron, but also when the children of God gathered together in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. When we gather together seeking Him, we are an audience for His speaking. And God Himself is in His speaking. The invisible, mysterious God is manifested in His word. As I speak, it is another opportunity for God to visit us in His speaking.<p>In the years since the recovery began, it has passed through many marvelous and also terrible things. But, whatever storms have come, the Lord&#8217;s recovery is still here. Once the Lord has built the church, it is unshakable and prevailing. Yet I believe that from today the Lord will give us a new beginning. I do not mean a new movement. It is still the old, even ancient, move of the Lord, but with a new beginning.<h2 class=head1>ALL BELIEVERS QUALIFIED</h2><p>This new beginning came from one of the messages given during the Ephesians training. While I was speaking that day on Ephesians 4:11, the light came. &#8220;And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers.&#8221; I saw that all the real believers can and must be like the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers.<p>Some humble ones may wonder how they could ever be like the apostles. They may feel it cannot possibly be so. Bible teachers, hearing this, might think that such a statement goes too far. But it does not go too far.<p>The light that came to me is based on Ephesians 3:8, where Paul says that he was &#8220;less than the least of all saints.&#8221; We consider the Apostle Paul a giant and therefore qualified to be an apostle. In this verse, though, Paul says he is less than the least of all saints. If we feel we are the least of all the saints, Paul says he is less than we are. If we believe Paul&#8217;s word in chapter one that God the Father has chosen us before the foundation of the world (v. 4), we must also believe what he says in 3:8, that he is less than the least of all saints and therefore less than we.<p>If Paul, who was less than the least of all saints, could be an apostle, how much more can you be one! &#8220;To each one of us was given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ&#8221; (4:7). Are you included in this verse? Surely each one of us is included. Notice also that the verb tense is past, was given. Grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of the gift of Christ.<p>&#8220;And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers&#8221; (v. 11). Are you included in this verse? No, you are not! But don&#8217;t think you are through. You are in verse 12. &#8220;For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&#8221; You are one of the saints to be perfected. Every believer is a saint.<p>Are those in verse 11-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers-greater than the saints in verse 12? Here we can answer both yes and no! Yes: The saints must be greater than the apostles and the other gifted ones because Paul, who was an apostle, said he was less than the least of all saints. Even the smallest saint was greater than he. No: The apostles and other gifted ones are greater, because they perfect the saints. It must be the greater who perfect the lesser. From verses 11 and 12 we would think that the gifted ones are greater, but from verse 8 it appears that the saints are greater than the gifted Apostle Paul. From these seeming contradictions we may conclude that all of us, whether saints or gifted ones, are about the same. We are all members of the Body. Paul was a member and so are we.<p>Notice, then, that you are in verse 7, but not in verse 11; you are also in verse 12. Verse 16 reads, &#8220;Out from Whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&#8221; Surely you are in this verse. &#8220;All the Body&#8221; includes you. You may not be one of the joints of the supply, but you are at least one of the many parts.<h2 class=head1>THE WORK OF PERFECTING</h2><p>What is the perfecting work that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are doing? It is to perfect the saints to do the same work as they themselves are doing. A basketball coach trains the players to play basketball as he does. If the perfecters fly like angels, they must not perfect the saints to creep like snakes! The fliers must perfect all those under them to fly also! The young ones must fly even higher than their perfecters. The outcome of this perfecting work is that all the saints become apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.<p>You may not be an apostle yet, but you should have the boldness to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m an apostle-to-be&#8221;! I am presenting to you what is in the Bible. We wear the tinted glasses of Christianity when we come to the Bible. Ministers and pastors are esteemed above ordinary believers. Seeing this causes us to think that the gifted ones in Ephesians 4:11 are special ones and that we are insignificant nobodies. Even among us today there is the concept that the apostle is above the elder and that the elder is higher than the other saints. When we come to the Bible, we bring this concept and insert it into the Bible. Because we do not come to find out the revelation from the Bible, there is no light.<h2 class=head1>ALL ON ONE LEVEL</h2><p>We say that among us there is no clergy or laity. Yet we rank some above others. If we say that the gifted ones in Ephesians 4:11 are higher, then we are making ourselves lower. This means there are two levels, and a hierarchy exists. How can we have only one level? This will be the case when the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers have perfected the other saints to be the same as they. The perfecting will uplift the saints to be all on one level.<p>Suppose, among the five hundred or so that are in this meeting, only fourteen are apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers. All the rest are humble, claiming not to know anything nor to be able to do anything. The fourteen are then the clergy; the rest are nobodies. This is Christianity&#8217;s fallen situation. The normal condition would be for the fourteen not to remain in a special rank, but day by day to uplift all the others, perfecting them till all of them are on the same level.<p>It may sound humble to say that you do not know anything and cannot do anything, but you have to be practical. You have to grow and be trained and practice until you are an apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, teacher.<h2 class=head1>OVERLAPPING GIFTS</h2><p>Do you believe that these categories of people are all distinct from each other? Can the prophet be an evangelist? Can the evangelist be an apostle? Consider the example of the Apostle Paul.<p>No doubt he was an apostle. Was he not also a prophet? In his Epistles he prophesied how the Lord Jesus would return. Does this not prove that he was a prophet? As for being an evangelist, he surely preached the gospel far more than others. How about his being a shepherd? He said he was like a nourishing mother, cherishing the churches (1 Thes. 2:7). Surely he was a shepherd, with all the churches on his heart. Lastly, he was also a teacher.<p>Suppose two of you are burdened to go to a village in Alaska. You leave your locality and go to an Eskimo village as sent ones. When you arrive, you begin speaking to those you meet. You speak Jesus. God. Redemption. Salvation. Regeneration. Life. When you preach the gospel, some Eskimos believe in the Lord and are baptized. They become a little church there. As you care for them and shepherd them, you will share with them about God&#8217;s economy, His eternal purpose, and His dispensation. Do you see how the two of you are apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers? Then eventually some of the Eskimo believers will be perfected. They will do the same thing as the two of you have done. They may either work in their village or be burdened to go, for example, to Moscow. In either case they would be the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers.<h2 class=head1>SENT ONES</h2><p>Every one of you can be all these four kinds of persons. Do not think this is too much. In your religious concept, an apostle might mean a prominent leader, but the Greek meaning of the word is sent one. If, for example, I send you to get my briefcase, you are my apostle. In John 20:19 and 21, &#8220;Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you....The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Then Jesus said to them again, Peace be to you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&#8221; This passage says the disciples (not the apostles) were assembled together, rejoiced when they saw the Lord, and were told by the Lord, &#8220;I send you.&#8221; The Lord Jesus was the Father&#8217;s sent One, coming to us as the Apostle. He was the first New Testament Apostle. Now we are His sent ones, going to others as apostles.<p>How did the Father send the Lord Jesus? He sent Him by going with Him. If you are constrained by the Lord, after praying, to say a word for Him to your mother, the Lord would say to you, &#8220;I send you as the Father sent Me. When you go to your mother, I shall be with you. Go and express Me, as I expressed the Father. Express Me and speak for Me.&#8221; To the Lord, then, you are a sent one; to your mother, you are an apostle. You may feel burdened, after contacting the Lord through prayer, to go to your relatives, or classmates, or neighbors. Go to them with Him and to express Him.<h2 class=head1>NORMAL</h2><p>I hope I have persuaded you that we can all be these gifted ones. They are not a special class. If you have not been perfected up to this standard, you are abnormal. Every normal Christian must be one sent by God. Do not say that you are still a student and therefore cannot be an apostle. God needs teenage prophets! You can be sent to your classmates by God. Preach the gospel to them. Then care for the new believers. Teach them about the three wills in the universe and about God&#8217;s economy.<p>If all of you are like this, a revival will spread throughout the earth. There is no need of a movement. There is no need for you to be ordained. You have already been ordained and chosen to be a sent one. Do you care about this? If so, go to the Lord and say, &#8220;Lord, I am here. I present myself to You. Send me.&#8221; The Lord will say, &#8220;I have already sent you. Go!&#8221; You must go to your relatives, friends, classmates, or even people you encounter on the street. You must speak persuasively to them. Preach the gospel and convince them.<h2 class=head1>HOW TO BE PERFECTED</h2><p>You not only can but you also must be an apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd and teacher. For this to come about you must read the Word. Acts 6:7 says, &#8220;And the word of God increased.&#8221; For the Word of God to grow and multiply there must be a period of learning, experiencing, and being dealt with. This is not an overnight matter. It requires the work of the leading apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers. What they do you also need to do. They take the lead, setting up the pattern. You follow. If they speak of God&#8217;s economy, that is what you speak. You say what they say, and do what they do. They are the lead sheep in the flock. If they turn right, the rest of you turn right. They do not do one thing and have you do something else.<p>You cannot speak the Word if you do not know it. You will be making a fool of yourself if you try to help others and you do not even know where Genesis is. God&#8217;s way is the way of the Word. It is not a miraculous or mushrooming growth based on gimmicks. Acts 6:4 says, &#8220;We will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.&#8221; God&#8217;s way is by life. Day by day read the Word and pray. Match whatever you read by prayer. Pray in order to digest the Word. Then it will get into you. Once this happens, the Word becomes the Spirit. With the Spirit, you have life, understanding, and utterance. Then you can be sent. The matter of being a gifted one is wholly wrapped up with the Word. Even if you are young, come to the Word regularly and pray-read it. Be mingled with the divine Word and the life-giving Spirit day after day. If you do this, within a very few years you will be ready to be sent and to be God&#8217;s spokesman, speaking for Him and speaking Him forth. You will preach the gospel and shepherd new ones, teaching them how to go on.<p>This was how the church life was in the beginning. Today we have a degraded situation, full of deadness. We must come back and let the Lord give us a new beginning.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-12; Acts 5:42; 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:11; 1 Cor. 12:29; 14:31; Acts 6:1-5</h1><h2 class=head1>SATURATED WITH THE WORD</h2><p>All of us can and must be among the gifted persons listed in Ephesians 4:11. The key to your becoming an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, and a shepherd and teacher is the Word. If you take very little of the Word into you, you will not be much of a gifted person. But if your being is saturated with the living essence of God&#8217;s Word, not merely with the knowledge of it, you will surely be His sent one. How much you take the Word into you and let it mingle with your inward parts determines the extent to which you can be God&#8217;s spokesman. When you become the embodiment of God&#8217;s Word, you spontaneously are one of His sent ones, speaking for Him and shepherding others. You do not need any official title, or appointment, or position. Those are outward and count for nothing. But if you are filled and saturated with God&#8217;s living Word, you are surely God&#8217;s apostle sent to this world and speaking for Him, and you are surely the shepherd caring for His people and teaching them God&#8217;s economy.<p>This is what God expects you to be. Do not say that you are not qualified. You have been chosen, saved, regenerated, and called by God. He is now working in you, saturating you with the Word. It is your duty to go to the Word, even in a legal way, morning and evening and during the day as well. Even if you can take only ten minutes each time, you will see how much benefit you receive.<p class=hbody>Thou art the Word with God&#8217;s fullness in Thee,<br>Thou too the Spirit that God my life be;<br>Thee in the Word I enjoy as my food,<br>Thou in the Spirit art water to me.</p><p class=hbody>Now to enjoy Thee I come to Thy Word,<br>On Thee to feed till my hunger is o&#8217;er.<br>Now in my spirit I turn unto Thee,<br>Of Thee to drink till I&#8217;m thirsty no more.</p><p class=hbody>Hymns, #811</p><p>All the churches, both in the United States and abroad, have been making this turn to the Word. I encourage you to continue to do this increasingly.<h2 class=head1>A TEACHING AND PREACHING MEETING</h2><p>&#8220;And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ&#8221; (Acts 5:42). The early saints were a teaching and preaching people. In homes and in the temple they taught and preached. Today&#8217;s situation is quite similar to what prevailed in Jerusalem in the time of the Acts. Then there was a strong background in Judaism. Now here in the United States there is a strong background in Christianity, including Catholicism. To meet this situation there needs to be a place and time set, known to all the people in the city, where the Word of God is taught in an atmosphere of preaching. In Anaheim we have already begun to do this on Lord&#8217;s Day mornings at 10:45. There is Bible teaching, but it is not in dead letters; it is delivered as gospel preaching. We teach the living Word and preach the high, all-inclusive gospel.<p>Many of you young saints lack the proper knowledge of the gospel. What, for instance, is the difference between redemption, salvation, justification, and reconciliation? What is the difference between being saved by the death of Jesus and being saved by the life of Christ? There is more to the gospel than telling people they are lost and bound for hell, but that God loves them and Jesus died to save them; if they believe in Him, they will be saved and go to heaven. Consider the Gospel of John. This whole book is the gospel. It tells us of the Word being God and becoming flesh; of the vine, the husbandman, and the branches; and of the Lord&#8217;s deep, rich prayer in chapter seventeen. Even that mysterious prayer is part of the gospel. Have you ever realized that the gospel is so comprehensive? It is not only others who lack knowledge; even we ourselves are short.<h2 class=head2>A Shining Lampstand</h2><p>Because of insufficient knowledge, both secular society and the so-called Christian churches are in darkness. In every place where the church is, that church must be a shining lampstand, shining forth the light of the truth of God&#8217;s Word. The churches can be such by having a preaching, teaching meeting regularly. We can then advertise the meeting by word of mouth, telling our relatives, neighbors, classmates, colleagues, friends, and acquaintances. Such a meeting, with an hour-long, attractively given message, will bring in a good increase, not from among the drifters but from those we know. The word will spread that there is such a place with the shining of the truth, and seekers will be attracted. In this way the whole church becomes a lampstand, with all of us as lights shining together.<h2 class=head2>Laboring to Get a Message</h2><p>If you are to have such a meeting, all of you must get into the Word. This is not the work of only two or three. Then the leading ones must be desperate to get a proper message for each Lord&#8217;s Day. It must be convincing and logical to the listeners. At first there may not be many new ones, but if you continue this way for a period of time, they will come. You can not preach the same thing every time, like &#8220;Jesus can satisfy your hunger.&#8221; People will be turned away by such repetition. Every meeting must be full of truth, logical, and convincing. It must be able to subdue all the differing opinions. The burden for the meeting must be on the whole church, not just a few.<p>It is not easy to take the lead. First Timothy 3:2 tells us that one of the qualifications of an elder is that he be skillful in teaching, &#8220;apt to teach.&#8221; He must enjoy teaching and teach well. The elders are not the teachers in Ephesians 4:11, but they nonetheless must be skillful in teaching. First Timothy 5:17 says further regarding the elders, &#8220;Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.&#8221; This verse says that the elders should be supported with the material supply, especially those who labor in the Word. When their time is fully occupied in taking care of the church, they will have no way to make a living. Thus I encourage all the elders to go to the Lord desperately each week to get a message for the teaching, preaching meeting. Do not take this matter lightly.<p>When Brother Nee was a young man, he picked up a burden to preach the gospel. Every Saturday he would fast for the whole day, while he prepared. He would kneel, reading the Bible, praying about his burden, and preparing a convincing message. Then the next morning he would deliver a logical, well-reasoned message. This is an example of how the elders must labor in the Word.<h2 class=head2>The Value to the City and the Church</h2><p>This meeting is not only for the church, but for the whole city as well. Every church which practices this will be a lampstand shining over the darkness. It will acquire a name as a place that knows the truth and can teach the Word. New ones will be added. Our own young people will be taught too. After perhaps four years of hearing such messages, all the saints will be ready to graduate! But those who take the lead must not consider themselves professors! They are merely laborers, taking the lead for others to follow and help.<p>This kind of meeting will really be in the nature of a training. Week after week, as we listen to the speaking on the Word, we shall be learning. At the same time, we shall be spontaneously trained. Then we can set up a small class in our home. Eventually, instead of just a few teaching and preaching, the whole church will be qualified. Besides the Lord&#8217;s Day meeting, there can be several home meetings, with classes for our neighbors and friends, where many of the saints can teach and preach the truth. This kind of preaching is the most prevailing. It will surely bring in the new ones and reap other benefits as well. It will lead to a real knowledge of the living Word, to the growth in life, to the experience of Christ, to the shepherding of others, and to the building up of the young ones.<p>If the churches feel burdened, they can begin to have a preaching, teaching meeting, as we have suggested here. To make a success of this, the whole church needs to get into the Word with much prayer. If you read the Bible without prayer, you will be in the dead letter. You should spend twice as much time in prayer as you do in reading the Bible. Every church needs to be characterized by reading the Word and by praying. This is not to say that you need to come together to do this. Rather, individually the saints should be praying and reading the Word. On this earth we are the ones who pray, read the Word, and digest it. All the saints must know the Word, have life, have the Spirit, and have an impact through praying.<h2 class=head1>NOT SEEKING OUTSIDE HELP</h2><p>In the past too often the churches have called on those from other places to come and help them. This indicates a weakness on the part of the responsible ones. Why would you not labor on the Word yourselves and contact the Lord directly, instead of sending out a Macedonian call, &#8220;Come over...and help us&#8221; (Acts 16:9)! It may seem humble to say that your church is weak and needs help, but is this wide open door the best way to get help? What was the result of all the calls that went out for help? Eventually one came who was not weak, and the churches were deceived. You must learn the lesson from this. Be strong. Do not look to Anaheim or to Brother So-and-so for help. Call the heavens and contact the Lord directly. Even if you feel weak, do not admit it. Be empowered. To be proud is ugly and sinful, but to be strong is necessary. You are not in need of outside help. Even if it is offered, you should seriously consider whether to take it. How much real outside help have you gotten these past few years? The supposed help you have received has only further weakened, even poisoned, you. You opened the door to this because you thought you were weak.<p>A housewife with five children may feel unable to cope with her situation. She keeps asking one neighbor after another to come and teach her how to manage and show her how to cook for her household. No one has time to be of help until one day a woman comes and offers to cook for her, saying she will be glad to help her out. When the family eats the meal the woman has prepared, they all get sick. She has poisoned it. Is that the kind of help you want?<p>Do not open your door without investigating any offer of help. Be sure the one who offers is qualified. Check his status and background.<h2 class=head1>FELLOWSHIP AMONG THE CHURCHES</h2><p>This is not to say that you do not need the other churches and should try to go on in an independent way. You must keep the door of fellowship open to all the churches, even while you keep the door of weakness shut to offers of &#8220;help.&#8221; It would be a strengthening to the churches here if the leading ones could come together perhaps once a month. Every so often the churches in the area could also come together for a joint Lord&#8217;s table meeting. Such mutual fellowship will increase the life supply in the churches.<p>Be clear, though, that every local church is responsible for itself. One church must not come under the jurisdiction of another. A larger or stronger church has no authority over a smaller, weaker one. All the churches, whatever their size or condition, are on the same level. Yet the churches should mutually nourish and strengthen each other. In this way we practice the local church life and also have the Body life. This is why we are here in the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<p>It would be good also for the leading ones to consider having a practical training, perhaps on a weekly or biweekly basis. They need to have some experience and training first, in order to have something to teach all the saints. Then the churches can come together on a weekday evening for practical training. In this way the churches will be further built up.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH SERVICE</h2><p>In the past we used to have &#8220;service groups,&#8221; taking care of the practical work that needed to be done, like mowing the grass and arranging the chairs. This use of the word service is not quite accurate in the biblical sense. The word service in Greek is the same as that translated ministry. What is the New Testament ministry or service? It is to be sent to others, to speak for God, to preach the gospel, to shepherd and teach others.<p>How then should we regard the practical matters that need to be taken care of? It is the duty of all of us to take care of these matters. We do not have one group who are evangelists and another group who take care of cleaning the hall. All of us are to be perfected as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. All of us also are to take care of the work that needs to be done, even though strictly speaking this is not the service. No one should think his status is too high to clean the rest room.<p>As to functioning in the meetings, this is included in the work of the prophets, evangelists, teachers and shepherds.<h2 class=head1>&#8220;ARE ALL PROPHETS?...YE MAY ALL PROPHESY&#8221;</h2><p>For many years I could not reconcile two verses in 1 Corinthians. In 12:29 it says, &#8220;Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?&#8221; Obviously, the answer is no. But then 14:31 states, &#8220;For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.&#8221; Why did Paul tell us in one chapter that not all are prophets, and then two chapters later say that all may prophesy?<p>It was only recently that I saw that what Paul was saying was that not all are leading prophets. In a flock of sheep, for example, there are only two or three leaders. The rest are not leaders, but they follow what their leaders do. Not all are prophets in the sense of being leading ones, but all can follow the example of the leading ones to prophesy.<p>In Jerusalem several were selected to serve meals (Acts 6:1-5). Two of them were Philip and Stephen. Some Bible teachers are of the opinion that the choice of these two was a mistake, because Stephen was an eloquent speaker (Acts 7) and Philip was an evangelist (21:8). How could these two have been asked to wait on tables? I believe these examples tell us that all those who wait on tables can be good speakers! All those who arrange chairs can be evangelists. The ones who clean the rest rooms may be leading evangelists. When the apostle comes, he can help mow the lawn. The proper service, then, is to be an apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd and teacher. The practical work is not the service, but we all take care of it.<p>May the Lord bring us into the practicality of this word.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>A HISTORY OF THE WORD OF GOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Tim. 3:16-17; John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6</h1><p>Let us trace together the history of the Word of God.<h2 class=head1>THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p>The Old Testament is made up of thirty-nine books. The first five, which are called the Pentateuch, were written by Moses, as we know. Other books were gradually added. Then, after the return from the Babylonian captivity, further books, like Daniel, Nehemiah, Ezra, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi were written. Though the date cannot be accurately fixed, from either the fourth or third century B.C. all thirty-nine books were generally recognized by the Jews as their sacred writings. Sometimes, however, the books were grouped together to make a total of twenty-two. In the time of Christ the Old Testament was called the law (John 12:34) and the Scripture (10:35).<h2 class=head1>THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2><p>The central focus of the Old Testament is the prophecy and the types of Christ. Then Christ Himself came and lived on this earth thirty-three and a half years. His life was actually a speaking, expressing God Himself as the reality to mankind. His living was more than a model or pattern; it spoke forth God to man. In a sense He was held in the flesh for those years, waiting to be processed from the flesh into another form. After His death by crucifixion, He was processed into resurrection. As God, He had taken the step of incarnation to become flesh and was confined in this form until released by crucifixion. Once He was ushered into resurrection, He took a further step and became the life-giving Spirit. The Lord Jesus Christ, as the life-giving Spirit, includes God and divinity; man and humanity; the mingling of these two in incarnation; a pattern of the uplifted human living that can satisfy God&#8217;s eternal purpose; His precious, all-inclusive death; and His mysterious, all-transcending resurrection and ascension. This One represents God, man, and all His accomplishments.<p>Though He is so great, He is as available as the air you breathe. When you take Him into you, you are receiving God, the proper humanity, the proper human living, the incarnation, the all-inclusive death, the wonderful resurrection, and the transcendent ascension. By breathing Him in, all His accomplishments become your reality.<p>It is the New Testament which reveals this to us, though for all these centuries the vision has not been as clear as it is today.<p>How could we know these marvelous truths if the four Gospels had not been written and printed? Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John present a composite picture of this wonderful One, each written from a different side or angle. Without all four, our picture of Him would be incomplete.<p>The New Testament continues with the Acts. In this book we have the record of how Christ was preached, propagated, and reproduced. Without the Acts, how could we know that this wonderful Person has been propagated into humanity and become the churches?<p>Without the Epistles from Romans to Jude, how could we know that the churches are His Body, His expression? How could we know how the Christian life and the church life should be?<p>In Revelation we have the completing of the revelation of Christ and the church. Without this final book, we would not know that the churches today are the lampstands and tomorrow are the New Jerusalem, expressing Him in full.<h2 class=head1>UNDERSTANDING THE WORD</h2><p>Without the Word, all these things would exist, but they would not be understandable or available to our faculties. God made us not only to drink of the Spirit. He made us with a wonderful mind to understand and grasp, and then to convey to our spirit what the mind understands, that we might drink of it. He also gave us two eyes so that we could read and a voice so that we could speak. Under God&#8217;s sovereignty man has invented writing and printing; this was so that He might reach us. God is abstract and invisible. For us to know Him He has arranged the invention of language and designed us to comprehend it. What God has spoken through the centuries has been written down in the Bible. This book is the very embodiment of God, of all that He is and all that He has accomplished. We can read, understand, and accept it.<p>Every day when we come to this Word, we use our eyes to read it, our mind to understand it, our heart to appreciate it, and our spirit to receive and realize it. The result is that we receive God, Jesus Christ, the Spirit, life, light, love, kindness, humility, patience (that is, all the divine and human virtues found in Him). Eventually we ourselves become the embodiment of God, just like the Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE DECLINE IN THE SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD</h2><p>Soon after the books of the New Testament had been completed and the apostles had passed from the scene, a new group arose, known as the church fathers. They initiated the study of Christology and became ensnared in debates. The Person of Christ is beyond the understanding of our limited mentality. Unresolvable argument was the result of these mental efforts to categorize Him.<p>The debate on the Person of Christ persisted from the end of the first century to the beginning of the fourth. Finally the Emperor Constantine took a hand in the situation. Ambitious to unite all the different factions that made up the Roman Empire, he called a convention at Nicaea to settle these theological debates. This Roman Caesar asserted his authority to end the fighting and to see that a creed was drawn up. In 325 A.D. the Nicene Creed was formed by this council over which Constantine presided.<p>It was not until 397 A.D., however, that the twenty-seven books of the New Testament were formally recognized. The council which decided that met in Carthage, North Africa. Before this date, seven books of the New Testament, including Hebrews and Revelation, were in question. You can see how incomplete a creed would be with seven of the New Testament books not even regarded as authoritative. The seven Spirits of Revelation (4:5), for example, are not mentioned in the Nicene Creed.<h2 class=head1>THE BIBLE HIDDEN</h2><p>It was around this time that Catholicism developed. By the end of the sixth century, the Roman Catholic Church and the papacy prevailed. They exercised their authority to forbid the common people to read the Bible, claiming that laymen could not understand it rightly. The result was that the Bible was locked up from the common people, with only the clergy being allowed to study it, and only according to the official interpretation.<p>These ten centuries, when the Bible was hidden, are called the Dark Ages. Without the Word of God shining, mankind was in darkness.<h2 class=head1>THE BIBLE UNLOCKED</h2><p>When the Reformation came, under Martin Luther, justification by faith was recovered. The Bible also was unlocked. This was the time when the printing press was invented, thus making the Bible more available. It no longer had to be copied by hand. Thousands of copies came into the hands of the laymen.<p>Still, however, the Bible was not open. People were free to read it, but they could not understand much of it.<h2 class=head1>THE BIBLE OPENED</h2><p>The Bible was opened some three centuries later in the hands of the Plymouth Brethren, under the leadership of J. N. Darby and others. It was the Brethren who came to understand the Old Testament typology and prophecies. They studied, for example, the image in Daniel 2, and by comparing it with history, learned that after the head of gold represented by Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon came the shoulders of Media and Persia. They identified the brass abdomen as Greece under Alexander the Great. They saw that the two iron legs were the eastern and western branches of the Roman Empire. They realized the ten toes corresponded to the ten horns of the beast.<h2 class=head1>THE BRETHREN ENSNARED BY DOCTRINES</h2><p>But alas! the Brethren fell into the snare of the subtle one. Yes, they opened up the Bible for us, but they fell into the trap of knowledge in letters. They came to care more for the doctrines than for the truth. How, for example, should the Lord&#8217;s table be held? With leavened or unleavened bread? With grape juice or wine? With one cup or many? With small pieces of bread or just one loaf? Should it be held morning or evening? Who can participate? Who should distribute the bread and the cup?<p>All these considerations have no end. They are in the realm of doctrine. They waste time, divide the saints, and create concepts. This is surely not the purpose of the Lord&#8217;s table. What is the truth regarding the Lord&#8217;s table? It is the Head and the Body, Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection. Let us care for these, not for the doctrines regarding the practice.<p>The same snare accompanied the matter of baptism. Should it be hot or cold water? Fresh water or salt? Sprinkling or immersion? How many times to immerse? In whose name? All these arguments, arising from the study of doctrines, served only to divide. We must care for the truth of baptism. It means that we are buried and terminated, then that we are resurrected and put into the Triune God.<p>Do you see the subtle device of the enemy? First the Bible was locked. Then it was released but not opened. Then it was opened, but very much in a doctrinal way. The scholars who researched the Bible fell into the subtle one&#8217;s trap, turning unawares from the realm of truth to that of doctrines.<h2 class=head1>THE BIBLE FRESHLY OPENED</h2><p>The Lord was forced to turn from the sullied soil of the Western world and go to a heathen land, China. From 1922 He raised up a group of young people. We studied the writings of the church fathers and the spiritual writings from the second century down to the present century. We read the histories and the biographies. The Lord gave us understanding and discernment; the revelation came. We realized we were standing on the shoulders of all those who had gone before. The Lord showed us what was right and wrong, what was lacking or superfluous.<p>Now we are here. Whatever we minister is the result of the past two thousand years of church history. We give credit to all those who have preceded us. But by His mercy the Lord has shown us the proper way to open up the Word, not being deficient and not going to excess. I have been studying this book nearly every day since 1925, more than fifty years. I was helped by Brother Nee, and we were helped by many teachers and expositors from the past. I do believe that what we put into print is the proper way to understand the Word. It is not too little nor too much.<p>The Lord is now moving in the churches to bring us all back to His Word. Studying the Word is not a simple matter. Either you will be short, or the enemy will push you too far. You could then repeat the history of the Brethren, with their exhausting, divisive, opinion-creating doctrines.<h2 class=head1>A HELP TO UNDERSTANDING THE WORD</h2><p>You can be saved from these snares by the books we have made available to you. If you use the Recovery Versions with the notes and the Life-study Messages, you will save much time and be kept on the right track. These are not necessary when you are doing your daily reading of three chapters in the Old Testament and one in the New. But when you are reading for nourishment or planning to study, use the Recovery Versions.<p>We have done the studying for you! Many times I have spent a whole day researching a single word. In spite of my having studied for so many years, there are still cases when I have to delve into the meaning of a certain word. I check the concordance, the lexicons, and the expository books. I look up how the word is translated in the forty or more English versions which I have. There are many interpretations of the same word. It requires much prayer and much discernment to make a final decision as to how to translate that word in our Recovery Version. You can see how much labor is involved.<p>When you want to study Romans, for example, you simply use the Recovery Version along with the notes and Life-studies. This will save you time and keep you from being side-tracked. It will probably be another five years before we finish all the New Testament books. Meantime, study the ones we have already printed.<h2 class=head1>USING YOUR SPARE TIME TO READ THE RECOVERY BOOKS</h2><p>I was happy to hear that some of you have a plan of study. In addition to reading through the Bible every year, and studying it with the help of the translations and Life-study Messages that are available, I would encourage you to read the books written by Brother Nee; read the back issues of the Stream Magazine; and read the other books we have published. This is a good program for the young people to follow.<p>Build up a habit of reading. Be sure you have all the recovery books in your home. Whenever you have a few minutes, pick up one of the books and read. The English is quite simple, so you can read quite a few pages in a short time. There is no need to study these books; even going over them quickly will benefit you. The same is true of the Life-study Messages. Simply read them in a smooth, flowing way; studying them may even be a frustration. As you take a few, spare minutes throughout the day to read even a few pages in a quick way, light will come. This reading is your entertainment; it is far better for you than television!<p>Everyone of us must be taught and trained to be a spokesman for God. Then we shall all be His sent ones, prophesying, evangelizing, shepherding and teaching. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is to rid us of the clergy-laity system, of hierarchy and rank, and of all the other traditions of today&#8217;s Christianity. Pray about this. Make it your goal to be fresh in this heavenly vision.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 11, 16; 4:14; 5:24; 6:57, 63; 7:37-38; 14:16, 23; 15:1, 3-5, 7-8; 17:1, 17; 20:22; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 19:13</h1><p>I would like to preach the gospel to you, as it is given in the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>OUR SHALLOW UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Our general understanding of the gospel is too limited. Yes, the gospel does include the matter of sin, for 1:29 tells us, &#8220;Behold the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; This verse implies Christ&#8217;s death, for that was the means by which He took away our sins. We may infer from 19:30 and 34 also that dealing with sin is included in the gospel.<p>The love of God is also included in this Gospel, as we well know from 3:16: &#8220;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&#8221;<p>We were pitiful sinners, but the Son of God loved us and died on the cross for our sins. If we believe in Him we are saved, and when we die we shall go to heaven. This is what we usually consider the gospel, but I must tell you that the concept of going to heaven is not to be found in the Gospel of John. Yes, this thought may be hinted at in other verses, but going to heaven, to tell the truth, is not the main item of the gospel.<h2 class=head1>JOHN&#8217;S GOSPEL</h2><p>In the twenty-one chapters of John we have the gospel. If we begin with the first verse, we can see clearly that the first item is not sin. &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; Verse 4 says further, &#8220;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&#8221; Have you ever regarded this as the gospel? Consider John 15. &#8220;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman....I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit....You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain&#8221; (vv. 1, 5, 16). These verses too are part of the gospel. John 17, the deepest, highest prayer of the Lord Jesus, is also part of the gospel. &#8220;These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You....Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth&#8221; (vv. 1, 17). We have considered passages like this as deeper truths for the edification of the saints, not as part of the gospel to be preached to unbelievers.<p>We surely need a new view of the gospel. You may say that these passages we have referred to are too difficult for unbelievers to grasp. You may think that even those who have been in the church life a long time do not really understand them. If this is your opinion, you are deceived. It may be that the saints, and even the elders, find such verses hard to comprehend, but that is because your eyes are clouded and you already have the concept that these matters are too profound to be understood. You are deceived because of your prejudice.<p>Our idea of how to preach the gospel is to tell sinners things that they can easily follow. We tell them they are sinners, and then apply the point by saying that they have stolen from others. We warn them about the eternal fire burning in hell and urge them to choose heaven, where the streets are of gold, a wonderful tree grows, a river flows, and there are mansions. This kind of preaching appeals to our natural concept. If this is our approach, we have no need to depend on the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>BELIEVING BECAUSE OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>If, however, we preach the biblical gospel, as found in John, we are surely constrained to put our trust in the Spirit. &#8220;Lord, if You do not open people&#8217;s eyes, if You as the life-giving Spirit do not work deep within their hearts, no one will follow; even I will not understand.&#8221; The result will be that many will understand and believe. The truth is that we do not believe because we understand. When we hear the gospel, we have no choice but to believe. It was foolish to believe, but we could not help it! When unbelievers hear about the Word which was in the beginning, the Word that was with God and that was God, they will believe and find themselves praising God. They will praise Him for this One called the Word; they do not know who He is, but they believe He is God.<h2 class=head1>PREACHING JOHN&#8217;S GOSPEL</h2><p>Try preaching what you know others cannot understand! Will you be foolish enough to do this? Will you practice on your parents? Do not preach about nuclear science! Preach from the Gospel of John! Tell your relatives, &#8220;So-and-so, I would like to tell you that the Lord Jesus is a vine. I am one of the branches. You are not one yet, but I hope that after we talk together, you will be.&#8221; Believe me, you will find a response. That one will say, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d like to be a branch like you. How does it happen?&#8221;<p>Then what will you say? How will you proceed? I hope you will not start telling him he is a sinner and needs to confess the things he has stolen, and then that he needs to pray for the Lord Jesus to come into his heart. Of course, if the Holy Spirit so leads you, that is all right. But many times that is simply your routine way of handling people. You need to answer according to the instant leading you have for each time, not according to the method you have devised.<p>The Holy Spirit may lead you to answer like this: &#8220;Look at John 1:16. It says, &#8216;For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.&#8217; So-and-so, you have to receive something of the Lord. This is the way for you to become a branch.&#8221; Do not think he will not understand. If you follow the Spirit and the Spirit works with you, he will understand. Your preaching of the gospel must no longer be natural, superficial, shallow, and low.<h2 class=head1>RECEIVING</h2><p>Have you yourself received of the fullness of Christ? Surely you will answer yes. But how much have you received? Christ is universally wide. An ocean is too small a measure to use in describing His fullness. His dimensions are those of the universe. Who can measure their breadth, length, height, and depth? Have you received only a drop, or a cup, or a pitcherful of His fullness?<p>Your receiving must continue daily, hourly, and minute by minute. The fullness of Christ is so vast that your receiving can not be once for all; it must be grace upon grace.<h2 class=head1>ABIDING</h2><p>Are you abiding in Christ right now? While you are in the meeting, it is easy to abide, but were you abiding this morning at the breakfast table? When you return home after the meeting, are you still abiding? I would like to help you abide by preaching the gospel of abiding to you!<p>The Lord says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; Then in John 15:7 He says, &#8220;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall come to pass to you.&#8221; Is the Lord abiding in you? Do you have His words abiding in you? I am preaching the gospel to you! Christ, the infinite God, is the vine. You and I are His branches. We are branches of the infinite God! We can abide in Him, and He can abide in us, making us one with Him. Hallelujah for the gospel! We are the branches of Christ! Even among us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, very few have entered into this gospel.<h2 class=head1>DRINKING</h2><p>The gospel also includes this verse: &#8220;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&#8221; (John 7:38). The Lord Jesus invited all those who were thirsty to come to Him and drink (v. 37). Rivers of living water should flow from you. How many rivers do you have flowing out of your inner being? Do you have a river of peace? of love? of power? of holiness? of humility? of kindness? If you sense a lack of rivers flowing from you, it indicates that you are not drinking sufficiently. You need to drink more of Him.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST OUR HOME</h2><p>Part of the gospel is also found in John 14:23: &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; Do you love the Lord? Do you keep His word? Do you have Him coming to you and making His abode with you? The thought here is mutual: we become His abode and He ours. You have an abode; you are not homeless. Who is your home? Christ!<p>I wish I could preach the Gospel of John to you in every meeting for a year! I think I would not even be finished after a year!<h2 class=head1>ENJOYING THE RICH GOSPEL</h2><p>How can we constantly enjoy this profound, rich gospel? We can find out right in this Gospel of John.<h2 class=head2>The Word and the Spirit</h2><p>Notice how many times the Word is mentioned. In chapter one the Word was in the beginning and was God. In chapter fifteen the words of Christ are to abide in us; His word has cleansed us. We are to love Him and keep His word (14:23). Those who hear His word have eternal life (5:24). The Father&#8217;s word is the truth which sanctifies (17:17).<p>Reference is also made again and again to the Spirit. &#8220;It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&#8221; (6:63). &#8220;He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; Even the Spirit of reality...you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you&#8221; (14:16).<p>The Word and the Spirit are crucial matters. For too long we have neglected them. We may come to the meetings, but we have not given our attention to the Word. We may pray, but we have not sufficiently regarded the Spirit. We must come back to care for both the Word and the Spirit.<p>The New Testament makes it clear that today the Lord is both the Word and the Spirit. &#8220;Now the Lord is that Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17). &#8220;His name is called The Word of God&#8221; (Rev. 19:13). The Word is also the Spirit (John 6:63). These three are one. All three are also life. The Lord, the Word, and the Spirit are all life. Thus, all these four are one.<p>The Word today is also the Bible in our hand. Outside us we have the Word. Within us is this Spirit. These two, the Spirit and the Word, are the two wires that transmit the heavenly electricity from the power plant into the building!<p>Open up the Bible. Open your eyes to read it. Understand it and love it. Combine this with praying. In this way you will be mingling the Word with the Spirit, thus transmitting Christ into you. You will be receiving of His fullness, grace upon grace.<p>Practice going to the Word throughout the day, snatching a few minutes here and there. It is in the Bible that you meet God, Christ, and the Spirit. Here is life, light, and love. Learn to open your whole being when you turn to the Word. Open your eyes to see, your mind to understand, your heart to love, and your spirit to pray and realize. This practice will bring you the Word with the Spirit. The result of thus sowing the seed into the soil is that life will spring up. Life will come forth from you.<h2 class=head2>Drinking, Eating, and Breathing</h2><p>We have not exhausted this gospel. Every line and every word of the book of John is part of the rich gospel. Just consider two short clauses. In 1:11 it says &#8220;He came&#8221; and in 1:16 &#8220;we all received.&#8221; The matter of His coming is an important part of the gospel. He came by way of incarnation. His coming has been accomplished. What about our receiving? It is a continual matter. We receive by eating, drinking, and breathing. This is the way we receive Christ into us. It is an organic, metabolic matter, different from the way we would receive a book that was handed to us. Such an organic receiving strengthens, transforms, and changes us.<p>Drinking, eating, and breathing, as the way to receive Christ into us, are all covered in the Gospel of John. Drinking is mentioned in 4:14. &#8220;Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever.&#8221; In 7:37 it says further, &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.&#8221; Eating is covered in chapter six; for example, verse 57 says, &#8220;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&#8221; Then breathing comes up in 20:22, where &#8220;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221;<p>If we take Christ into us by these means, we shall be receiving of the fullness of this all-inclusive One. We need to be filled with this gospel. If we equip and arm ourselves with it, we shall all be able to teach and preach and even live out this gospel. Then the church life will be strong.<h2 class=head1>STRENGTHENING THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>In the matter of taking care of the church life, it is easy to be concerned with the kind of meeting we should have. I would like to remind you that a particular kind of meeting in itself will not strengthen the church life. If we feel the church meetings are weak, it is not that the way of meeting is wrong. The lack is with the drinking, eating, and breathing of the Lord Jesus, as revealed in the Gospel of John. Let us come back to this book and learn to drink adequately, to eat richly, and to breathe prevailingly. Then the church will be strong and shining.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY</h1><h1 class=msg>LIVING BY CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Col. 1:27; 2:16-17; 3:4, 10-11; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:21a</h1><h2 class=head1>THE HEART OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>Of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament four may be considered as its heart. The heart is crucial. You may lose a finger or even your nose and still survive. But without your heart you are finished. What books in the New Testament would you say are the most vital? Over these many years I have worn out several Bibles through using them so much. Even so, the pages of many of the books were not worn out. But the pages of four books in those Bibles soon showed signs of wear. Even the Bible I am using now has these same pages well worn. If you check the Bibles of seeking Christians, I believe you will find these very pages also worn.<p>These books are Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. They are really the heart of the whole Bible, not just of the New Testament. Their theme is Christ and the church.<p>Galatians reveals that Christ stands in opposition to religion, even the Jewish religion, which was set up according to the commandments and ordinances given by God. Christ is on one side, and the Jewish religion and its law are on the other. Surely the Jewish religion was the highest; no heathen religion could compare with it. Yet Christ stands against it.<p>Christ versus Greek philosophy is the message of Colossians. When Colossians was written, the Mediterranean world was ruled by Rome. Roman politics and law prevailed. What attracted people of that day were the Jewish religion and Greek philosophy. Even in today&#8217;s modern Western culture, these three components prevail: Roman politics and government, the Hebrew religion, and Greek philosophy. The philosophy dealt with in Colossians was Gnosticism, which included, besides Greek philosophy, elements of Egyptian, Babylonian, and Persian philosophies.<p>Religion and philosophy are culture&#8217;s highest inventions. Without them mankind would be wild, barbaric. They would be like the Scythians (Col. 3:11), who were considered the most barbaric of people, lacking any semblance of religion or philosophy. Human culture rests largely on these two things. Because of them the fallen race is kept under constraint and has a good appearance. But these two books make clear that Christ stands against both religion and philosophy. However good these are, they are no match for Christ. He is far above them.<p>The message of Philippians is &#8220;to me to live is Christ&#8221; (1:21). This Christ, who stands in opposition to the highest human attainments, is our life. We are not religious people nor philosophical people; we are Christians, &#8220;Christ people.&#8221; A Christian has Christ within and lives Him out.<p>The result of this Christ living in us, opposed to religion and philosophy, is the church, the theme of Ephesians. The church is Christ, opposing religion and philosophy, and living out of His people. This Christ within and among His people is God revealed, the heart of the divine revelation.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED TO LIVE CHRIST</h2><p>In these recent months the churches have been brought back to the Word and to prayer. I believe also that the churches are seeking to live Christ, a life that builds up the church. We thank the Lord for this. The messages that have been given on the book of Philippians have greatly helped the churches. The same is true of the messages given in the trainings on Ephesians. Yet not too long ago the Lord rebuked me. He pointed out what a lack there is of Christ in the churches. Christ is not practically lived out in the church life. As I knelt there before Him, I took the lead to confess my shortage of Christ. May the Lord reveal to us how we lack the practical living by Christ. I was not rebuked for raw sins or worldliness; by His mercy and grace I can testify that these things do not touch me. But the Lord said, &#8220;You may not be worldly or immoral, but how much Christ do you live?&#8221; I had to confess that it is very little.<p>I believe that most of you also can say that you do not easily fall into rough sins or worldliness. Such things have little appeal for you. But in your daily walk, how much of Christ has been wrought into you? Your policy is to behave properly. You feel condemned if you tell a lie, for example. But do you ever feel condemned that you have not lived Christ? If you act properly, you have no sense of condemnation. This indicates that unknowingly you are paying attention to ethics and morality, caring for human virtues.<h2 class=head1>NOT GOOD BEHAVIOR</h2><p>Occasionally I take a look at my diary. A number of times I have recorded that I did not do well in something, or that I was wrong, or that I was mistaken. But rarely does an entry say, &#8220;Today I was short of Christ.&#8221; Does not this indicate how much I cared for good behavior?<p>Our attention is on virtuous behavior. When we are proud, we regret that we lack humility. But when we treat others kindly, we may be short of Christ. We may be prompted by our natural love. We are in naturalness. It is possible for us to live a life which expresses the human virtues, like kindness and consideration of others, but to live by Christ is foreign to us.<p>Why is it so hard for us to live out Christ? Even back in 1970 we heard many messages on Christ being our life and on taking Him as our person. Those messages were well received by the saints, and a number of hymns were written on taking Christ as our person. But the messages have become a faded memory, and we are left with only the doctrine and some hymns.<h2 class=head1>PRESERVED IN CHRIST BY PRAYER</h2><p>Many times you have had the experience, while praying, of praying yourself into the spirit. At these times you were taking Christ as your person. At such times of prayer, when you were one with the Lord, taking Him as your life, you wanted to linger with Him, even to be raptured. But once that time was over, it seemed you immediately slipped back into yourself.<p>It is because of this that the Word tells us to pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). Unceasing prayer is the only way for us to be preserved in Christ. I have tried other ways, like exercising faith, but from experience I tell you, without praying we are outside of Christ; with prayer we are in Him.<h2 class=head1>THREE BASIC MATTERS</h2><p>During these sixteen or so years I have been in the United States, I have sought to impress you with three basic matters. I long for them to be wrought into your being.<h2 class=head2>The Life-giving Spirit</h2><p>Our God today is the life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45 is an important verse in the Bible. Who is the last Adam? It is Christ, the very God who created all things; who became incarnate, confined in a carpenter&#8217;s home in Nazareth for thirty years and then ministering for three and a half years; who entered into death and then into resurrection. In resurrection this One became a life-giving Spirit.<p>Now our God is no more just God, Elohim. He is Father, Son, and Spirit. Not only so, but the Father, Son, and Spirit have become a life-giving Spirit. It is in this form that God reaches us. Colossians 1:27 speaks of &#8220;this mystery...which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&#8221; How could Christ be in us if God had not become a life-giving Spirit? If &#8220;Christ in you&#8221; is a fact, not just a motto, He must be the life-giving Spirit.<p>The life-giving Spirit is the reaching stage of the Triune God. As the Father He cannot reach us. Even as the Son He can only reach us outwardly. But as the Spirit He can enter into us. Most Christians have no understanding or appreciation of this. Even we in the recovery, who have heard so many messages on this very subject, have very little realization in our daily walk that our God today is a processed God. The processed God is now within us as the life-giving Spirit. This is not only a fact, but also a key factor in our Christian life.<h2 class=head2>A Regenerated Spirit</h2><p>God created us with a spirit, but this spirit was deadened. Then God came in and regenerated it with His divine life. We are not animals without a spirit, nor are we only humans with a deadened spirit. We are those whose spirit has been regenerated with the element of the divine life. This is the second factor in our Christian life.<p>Your enlivened spirit is not merely a fact for you to believe. It may be a fact, for example, that you have a large bank account. But nonetheless you may be walking the streets as a beggar. When your bank account becomes a factor in your daily living, you will begin to write checks and draw upon the money you have. Is it only a fact to you that your God is a processed God and is now the life-giving Spirit in your spirit? Is it only a fact to you that your spirit is no longer deadened but rather regenerated with the divine life? These facts are hardly known among general Christians. But for you in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, who know the facts, they still affect you very little. Otherwise, you would be writing checks and enjoying your riches!<h2 class=head2>Walking according to Spirit</h2><p>If you read through your Bible, going on from the Old Testament through to the end of the New Testament, you will see that the Lord&#8217;s ultimate charge to you is not that you follow laws or teachings, but that you walk according to spirit (Rom. 8:4). The word translated spirit in Romans 8:4, and in several other verses in Romans 8, presents a problem to translators. It is hard to decide whether to regard spirit as referring to the Holy Spirit and capitalize it, or to consider that it is the human spirit and not capitalize it. The spirit here refers to the mingled spirit, our spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit. We need another size letter to denote this, neither a capital letter nor a small one! These two spirits, the divine and the human, have become one (1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; 2 Cor. 3:17).<p>Walking according to this mingled spirit is the third factor in our Christian life. To walk means to live, to act, or to have one&#8217;s being. We must live and act and have our being, not according to the Ten Commandments, or the so-called Sermon on the Mount, or some doctrines, but according to the mingled spirit.<p>Practice walking this way. Every day, from morning till evening, cease from your doing and seek to constantly remain in this mingled spirit.<h2 class=head1>MORALITY VS. THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2><p>In 1933 I began to make a clearance of my past. I made restitution to people that I had wronged. Once that was over, I made up my mind never to do wrong again. This I tried to keep up for about two and a half years. It was hard not to be wrong! I remember sharing a room with a brother during a retreat. Hard as I tried, I found myself doing one thing after another that offended him. I spilled some water on his bed and apologized. Then I said something not accurate, and I had to confess that to him. Then I felt my apology was insincere. I seemed to be continually under condemnation.<p>Now, however, it is no longer my aim not to make mistakes. Every day, early in the morning, my first prayer is, &#8220;Lord, grant me the mercy that I may live Your life. I want to be one with You in spirit. May I have my whole being in the mingled spirit.&#8221; The result has been that a number of times I have had to confess to the Lord, &#8220;I have not done this according to the spirit....What I said to the elders was not according to the spirit.&#8221; There may have been nothing outwardly wrong, but nonetheless it was not according to the spirit.<p>We are used to living according to our natural life. We are under the influence of morality. If we lie, we feel condemned. But if we do or say something without Christ, we have no sense of condemnation. We may not do wrong, but in God&#8217;s eyes we lack Christ in our doing or in our speaking.<h2 class=head1>THE ULTIMATE COMMANDMENT</h2><p>Actually, to lack Christ is sin. The consummate commandment in the whole Bible is that we walk according to spirit. Is it not a sin to break this commandment? We may have done many moral, virtuous things, but without Christ. It is this failure that weakens the church life. A normal, rich church life is evident only when Christ is lived out by us.<p>Let us practice living by Christ and taking Him as our life and person. Whether we are at home with our family or at work or at school, in all our contacts and in all our living, let us have every part of our being according to the spirit. To allow Christ to thus live Himself out from within us is the Christian life. Then it will be our experience that we have been crucified with Christ, and that it is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me (Gal. 2:20). We shall be able to say truthfully, &#8220;To me to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21).<p>Walking according to spirit is the building factor of the church life. It will make the churches rich and glorious. Live by Him!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>TAKING CHRIST AS LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Col. 1:27; 2:2, 15-17; 3:4, 10-11, 16; Eph. 6:16-18; John 6:63; 16:8-9</h1><h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h2><p>In the universe there are three parties-God, man, and Satan. Satan, under God&#8217;s sovereignty, is the negative party. The other two parties, God and man, should be identical. But when man fell, he took a direction other than God&#8217;s. This was the beginning of the discrepancy between God&#8217;s economy and man&#8217;s concepts.<p>The matter of God&#8217;s economy is foreign to most Christians. This term economy, anglicized from the Greek, is not easy to define. The meaning in Greek is a dispensing, or an administration for dispensing. God&#8217;s economy is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. That God would dispense Himself into man, and that certain ones would be the recipients of His dispensing, was not a decision made in response to conditions that were going on in time. It was not accidental, nor was it determined by circumstances. Rather, it was purposed by Him in eternity past and pertains also to eternity future.<p>This matter of God&#8217;s economy is made abundantly clear in the four books that form the heart of the New Testament- Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. (I hope you will prize these books, even unto the New Jerusalem!) In Ephesians, for example, the Greek word is used in 1:10 and 3:9, where it is translated dispensation, and in 3:2, where it is translated stewardship. In Colossians 1:25 it is also translated stewardship.<h2 class=head1>ORGANIC</h2><p>God dispenses Himself into us organically. The life He imparts to us is not like a set of dentures, which may be worn year after year without ever becoming part of us. His dispensing is more like the grafting of one piece of skin on another. The two pieces grow together and within a short time cannot be separated. They have become organically joined and share a common life.<p>God is life. Life is organic. The Bible tells us that God created man in His image (Gen. 1:26). Man was created in God&#8217;s image so that He and man could be organically one. It is not like the kind of oneness formed by putting several volumes of a book next to each other. It is rather the growing together of two like entities. You may argue that the divine life and the human life are not like entities. There is some truth to this: one is human and the other is divine! But for man to be in God&#8217;s image means that the function of both lives is the same.<p>Our relationship to God is likened to grafting in Romans 11:17, 19, 23 and 24. We are the branches grafted into the olive tree. Two pieces of dry wood cannot be grafted together; they would have to be joined inorganically by a carpenter! Only a living branch and a living tree can be grafted together. Grafting is an organic process.<p>The Christian life is a hybrid life; that is, it is the product or result of the blending of two different lives. We were born human, but in our second birth we were born of God (John 1:13). By the new birth the divine life has been imparted into us. As sons of God, we are divine dignitaries! It is not a small thing for anyone to harm us. We are divinely human, and humanly divine! Our life has been grafted into God. He is working Himself into us organically.<p>John 15 clearly pictures this organic relationship. The vine and the branches are not united by a carpenter&#8217;s hammer! The branches are not like dentures artificially held in place! We are the branches of God, organically one with Him! We are part of God, just as my arm is part of me. Some may say that this is heretical teaching; such ones are in darkness. If we are in the light, we shall see and rejoice that as the branches of Christ, we are part of Him.<p>Organically-we are organically joined to God! This is His economy.<h2 class=head1>THE SOURCE OF OUR CONCEPTS</h2><p>But we have our own ideas. Where have all our concepts come from? We are buried in the deep, dark tomb of our concepts!<h2 class=head2>The Fall</h2><p>Our concepts are firstly the result of the fall. God&#8217;s intention was that the man He had created should partake of the tree of life. This was to be man&#8217;s life supply. God warned man not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; if he did, he would surely die (Gen. 2:17). Man disobeyed and thus fell. He rejected the tree of life and chose the tree of knowledge. This tree of knowledge became a tomb, where man today is still buried.<h2 class=head2>Culture</h2><p>Culture arose after the fall. Genesis 4:17-24 describes its beginnings in the inventions that were made. Culture is not from the tree of life. Its source is the tomb of knowledge. Our concepts are rooted in our culture. Some are based on our national origins. Some are from the past; others are modern.<h2 class=head2>Religion, Philosophy, Ethics</h2><p>Religion, philosophy, and ethics have all influenced our concepts. Religion, especially Judaism, appeals to the Jewish mentality. To the Greek, philosophy is what matters. To the Chinese, ethical behavior is all-important. In fact, all of us have the desire for good behavior deeply rooted in our concepts. The concepts we have taken from religion, philosophy, and ethics are a hindrance to our initial receiving of the Lord and then to our living by Him.<h2 class=head2>Human Virtues</h2><p>Within all human beings there is the thought of being virtuous. We like to be thought of as kind and generous. We like to have a reputation for being mild-mannered and patient. We like to give the impression that we are pleasant and gracious. Wherever I have been-in many different parts of the world-I have found this same aspiration on the part of the people.<h2 class=head2>Spiritual Aspirations</h2><p>The spiritual seeking of Christians is in this same realm. First they seek for salvation. Then they strive for victory over sin, the world, and the flesh. The only interest of such Christians is in being spiritual.<h2 class=head1>A BURIAL TOMB</h2><p>These are the seven layers of the tomb in which we are buried: the fall, culture, religion, philosophy, ethics, individual virtues, and spiritual seeking. The reason it is hard for us to live by Christ is that most of us still remain in this tomb. We have no condemnation for the good things of our culture. We respect religion. We admire philosophical thought. We justify ethics. We appreciate human virtues. We are impressed by people with a spiritual air about them, who are seeking to live a holy life; we do not realize that while they are caring for their spirituality and personal holiness but disregarding the church, they are still buried in the tomb of concepts.<h2 class=head1>NO PLACE FOR OUR CONCEPTS</h2><p>In God&#8217;s economy there is no place for religion, or ethical behavior, or human virtues. God&#8217;s concern is only for Christ. He wants Christ expressed in us, not human virtues. But the thought of living by Christ does not have much meaning for us. We have no idea, or very little idea, of what it means.<p>Consider these verses in John 16 about the Holy Spirit: &#8220;And having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment; Concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me&#8221; (vv. 8-9). The Holy Spirit will convict the world concerning sin. How sinful the world is! There is robbery, murder, and fornication. Surely the world will be convicted for this. But, no! The Lord said the conviction for sin is &#8220;because they do not believe in Me.&#8221; In the New Testament economy the first commandment  given by God is that we believe in the Lord Jesus. To break this commandment is sin. Those who perish do so, not because of committing robbery or fornication, but because of unbelief.<p>The universe is God&#8217;s, not ours. He is the Administrator. To disobey His commandment that we believe in His Son is rebellion. Whether we are a gentleman or a bank robber, God&#8217;s commandment is that we believe in His Son. In Moses&#8217; time there were Ten Commandments, but now there is only one. To refuse to believe in the Son is the sin for which mankind will perish.<p>Many Jewish people think they are worshipping God. They do their best to live by the Ten Commandments. But they do not know that in the New Testament economy, God has given a new, different commandment. Because they will not believe in Christ, they are guilty of rebellion.<p>After we are saved, God gives us another commandment: walk according to the spirit. But instead of heeding this basic commandment, we pay attention to the exhortations that suit our natural mentality. We try to love our wives or submit to our husbands, but exhortations like these are not basic.<p>If we are not saved, God&#8217;s commandment is that we believe in His Son. Once we are saved, He commands that we walk according to the spirit. We can all experience that by our believing in the Lord Jesus we inherit all things. Holiness, victory, spirituality, and every spiritual blessing become ours.<p>Seek Christ. Do not seek spirituality. To seek anything other than Him is to miss God&#8217;s economy. Paul wrote to the Galatians because they had been distracted from Christ by the Jewish religion. He wrote to the Colossians because they had been distracted from Christ by Gnosticism, including Jewish and heathen philosophies.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST A MYSTERY</h2><p>Christ is presented to the Colossians as a mystery. In Colossians 1:27 it refers to &#8220;this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&#8221; A mystery is a secret. Christ is the secret of the gospel. Strange as it may sound, the gospel is not merely for salvation. The gospel is for Christ. He is its center and reality. When we receive the gospel, we of course participate in God&#8217;s salvation, but that is only an issue; it is not basic. Christ Himself is what is basic to the gospel.<p>In Colossians 2:2 Christ is called the mystery of God. God Himself is a mystery. Christ is the mystery of this mystery! He is the secret of this mystery. Then in verses 16 and 17 Paul goes on to point out how the Colossians have been influenced by the Judaizers in their eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths. All these things-whether daily, yearly, monthly, or weekly-&#8220;are a shadow of things to come.&#8221; The light may cause a table, for example, to cast a shadow, but that shadow is not the body of the table. Paul says that their practices under the Levitical law are all shadows, &#8220;but the body is of Christ.&#8221; How sad for the Colossians to miss the body and care for shadows!<p>Christ is the body. In other words, Christ is the real food, the real drink, the real Sabbath, the real new moon, and the real feast. He is the reality of everything positive.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST ALL AND IN ALL</h2><p>In Colossians 3:4 Christ is called &#8220;our life.&#8221; This mystery of God, the body of all positive things, is to be our life. In the new man &#8220;there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all&#8221; (v. 11). In the new man there is no room for you or me. Christ is all; He is each one of us. The only person in the new man is Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD OF CHRIST</h2><p>How can we contact Christ? In this book of Colossians Paul does not deal with the matter of the Spirit. After revealing Christ as the mystery of God, as the body of all positive things, and as all in all to the new man, Paul exhorts the Colossians, &#8220;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly&#8221; (3:16). The thought in this verse is that the word of Christ should have a house, or dwelling place, in us, &#8220;in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&#8221;<p>The word of Christ! This is what we must take in, but not as knowledge. Christ said in John 6:63, &#8220;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&#8221; We must take this word in as life.<p>We must also take the Word in &#8220;by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit&#8221; (Eph. 6:17-18).<p>God wants you to take Him as your life. He wants you to live by Him. Forget your culture, your philosophy, your ethics, and your spiritual seeking. Live by Christ! When you see this as a vision, you will condemn even your best virtues. You will fear your virtues more than your sins. You will realize that expressing your virtues is a rebellion against God&#8217;s administration. You will not sanction anything but Christ. You will have no way but this narrow way of Christ.<p>This is the testimony, Christ Himself. Spending time in the Word is not the testimony. Nor is fellowship. Even the church life without Christ is not the testimony. Only Christ living in us and lived out of us is the testimony.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>HOW TO ABIDE IN CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:12-13; 3:5-6; 4:24; 6:63; 14:17-20, 23; 15:1, 4-5, 7-8; 20:22</h1><h2 class=head1>RECEIVING CHRIST</h2><p>The Gospel of John, especially in the verses given above, answers the question of how to abide in Christ. In 1:12-13 there is the matter of receiving Him: &#8220;But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: Who were born...of God.&#8221; Have you received Him? Sometimes doubts come in after we are saved. Suppose, however, I ask you where you got your Bible. You will have no trouble telling me exactly where and how and when you received it. With the matter of receiving Christ, it may be more difficult to give a clear answer. John 1:12 can resolve this uncertainty for you. Receiving Him means believing in His name. When did you receive Christ? It was when you believed in His name. How did you receive Him? It was also by believing in His name.<h2 class=head1>BEING BORN FROM ABOVE</h2><p>Verse 13 goes on to say that we were born of God. This is not a human birth, making us a certain nationality. Those who have never experienced the new birth find such a term incomprehensible. Even many Christians are not thoroughly clear about the divine birth. We all need to see that besides our first birth into the kingdom of men we have had another birth into the kingdom of God.<p>In regeneration we were born of God with the divine life and nature. In John 3 the matter of the new birth comes up again. The Greek term is properly rendered born anew or born from above, not born again. We have not only had an earthly birth; we have also been born from the heavens.<h2 class=head1>TWO SPIRITS</h2><p>John 3:6 says, &#8220;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; This birth from above involves two spirits, the divine and the human. The new birth is by the divine Spirit in our human spirit. In this birth two spirits meet.<p>In John 4 there is another matter involving the two spirits. Verse 24 says, &#8220;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.&#8221; The proper worship is to worship the Spirit in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>SEEKING AN ANSWER</h2><p>Our topic in this message is &#8220;How to Abide in Christ.&#8221; It is this book of John which gives us the key. While chapter fifteen is the central chapter on this, the surrounding chapters are all related to it. For many years I did not realize this. As a young man seeking after the Lord, I surely loved the word in John 15 on abiding. But I kept wondering how to do it.<h2 class=head1>THE KEY FOUND IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2><p>Our efforts to abide in Christ seemed always to end in failure. Because of such frustration, we were compelled to spend more time in the Gospel of John. In order to uncover the secret of abiding, which is revealed in the middle of this book, we thought we should follow the principle of studying the whole book thoroughly. This we did.<p>To abide in Christ, then, begins with the divine birth in chapter one. Chapter three goes on to tell us that this birth from above involves two spirits. The worship in John 4, of the Spirit by the human spirit, also involves the two spirits.<p>In 6:63 John proceeds from the two spirits to the Word. &#8220;It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&#8221; Abiding is not merely a matter of the Spirit; the Word is also involved. The Greek here is the instant, practical, present word of the Lord.<p>In chapter fourteen the Lord and His disciples were together when suddenly He told them He was going away. He told them not to be sad, that by His leaving another Comforter could come. He was implying that however wonderful His presence with them was, He could only be among them, not within them. But when the other Comforter came, He &#8220;shall be in you&#8221; (14:17). This other Comforter would be none other than Himself as the Spirit of reality. That is why He said in the next verse, &#8220;I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you&#8221; (v. 18). As the Spirit He could be not only with them but also in them. &#8220;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&#8221; (v. 20).<p>Notice 14:23. &#8220;Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&#8221; This word abode is the noun form of abide. The Father and Son will come to the one who loves Them not only for a visit but to make an abode. This abode is mutual. They will abide in him, and he will abide in Them. The abiding in chapter fifteen comes from the abode, or mutual abiding place, in 14:23.<p>I trust you are beginning to see that to understand the matter of abiding in Christ, you need the whole Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST IN ANOTHER FORM</h2><p>Chapter one tells us that Christ as God took on human form (1:14), but when we meet Him at the end of the Gospel, He has another form, that of the Spirit. In the evening of the day He was resurrected, He came to where the disciples were meeting and stood in their midst (20:19). How did He get into the room when the doors were shut? No one opened the door for Him, but suddenly He was there. He talked to the disciples, showed them His hands and side, and even breathed into them, saying, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (vv. 20-22). In so doing He was breathing Himself into them as the life-giving Spirit. By inhaling the holy breath (spirit and breath are the same word in the Greek), the disciples were receiving Christ as the Spirit into them. After this meeting with the disciples, there is no record in John that the Lord left. From this point on, He was in them, no longer just among them. He had fulfilled His promise to return as the Comforter and abide in them.<p>How can we be branches in the vine? How can we abide in Him and have Him abide in us? For many years I could not figure this out, until one day I saw that as the life-giving Spirit He had entered into my spirit, just to be one with me. I am one with Him, not in my mind, emotion, or will, but in my spirit.<p>Today the Lord is no more Jesus in the flesh. He is now the life-giving Spirit. Concerning His exaltation, He is at the Father&#8217;s right hand as Lord of all (Acts 2:32-36). But concerning His indwelling, He is within us as the life-giving Spirit. Because He is in our spirit, we are one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This one spirit is the vine. These two spirits are one in the divine life and one in the divine nature.<p>If you see this, there is only one more thing I need to mention, and that is, how to abide in Him. There is no need for you to do anything except abide.<h2 class=head1>THE ABSENCE OF FEELING</h2><p>I would like to tell you the secret of abiding. This is based upon my experience, not on the black and white pages of the Bible. Matters concerning life are not characterized by feeling. If you have a stomachache, you know something is wrong. If you have a pain in the chest, you need to see a doctor. When you are in good health, however, you are not conscious of any particular feeling. The same is true when you are abiding. As soon as you are out of Christ, you are aware of it. If you criticize a brother, you know deep within that you are not abiding. Even in a small matter, like smiling a little, you may sense that you are not abiding. You may say yes to a question and sense that your answer was a political one, spoken apart from the abiding.<p>When you find yourself in a difficult situation, do not react. If you feel you are not abiding in Christ, do not say anything. If your wife starts an argument with you and you feel you are not abiding, do not answer or even look at her. Do not even pray. Let her keep talking. Do not say, &#8220;Praise the Lord!&#8221; That would be coming from your flesh and would only further aggravate her. Practicing not to do anything is the negative secret of abiding in the Lord!<p>If you feel drawn to love something apart from the abiding, refrain from loving it. &#8220;Lord, I turn away from whatever does not come from my abiding in You.&#8221;<p>By this divine birth two spirits have been joined into one. The divine part within has the desire to worship the Father; the divine Spirit would worship by your human spirit. This divine part also loves and appreciates the words spoken by the Lord, His instant practical speaking. This divine part further tells you that the Father and the Son are making an abode with you, and that you are abiding in Him. Whenever you sense within that you are not abiding, say, &#8220;Lord, forgive me and cleanse me. I don&#8217;t want to be out of the abiding. I want to stay in You all the time.&#8221;<p>In this abiding we pray without ceasing. Our prayer while we are abiding is simply our spontaneous trust in the Lord.<h2 class=head1>SIGNS OF ABIDING</h2><p>How many of you will practice this? Those who do will find that they are in practice one with the Lord. They are one in the mingled spirit. At times they will not say even a word. They will not take any action. They will not express an opinion. They simply remain in the spirit that involves the two spirits. In this abiding they have holiness; victory over sin, the world, Satan, the flesh, and the self; spirituality; the actuality of being a member of the Body of Christ; the normal Christian life; and the proper church life. No problem remains, for they are one with the Son of God, who has conquered all the negative things. Instead of striving, they enjoy what He has accomplished. Their unceasing prayer is the expression of their constant trust in this living One who is now one Spirit with them.<p>This should be the experience of all of us. I have tried various ways in the past to overcome sin and be victorious. Now we have learned that the secret of all the hows is in the abiding.<p>When we abide in this mingled spirit, every spiritual blessing is ours, because it is wrapped up in this dear One. In Him, this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, is the processed God; the uplifted humanity; the all-inclusive death and resurrection; redemption; and ascension. Let us abide in Him and enjoy His all-inclusiveness.<h2 class=head1>LOVE AND VISION</h2><p>To believe in the Lord is adequate for us to have the divine birth. But to enjoy the divine birth by abiding, we need to love Him. The Gospel of John first tells us to believe in Him, then to love Him. &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&#8221; (14:23). This making of the mutual abode depends upon a constant love on our part. (On His side the love is always there.)<p>Keep this vision always before you. Do not allow any veil to cover your eyes. Do not be side-tracked by the enemy. Do not say you cannot stand a certain brother, that the church life is not so good in your locality, or that the recovery has gone downhill these past years. Any such remark will keep you out of the abiding. One complaint can cut your lifeline. To criticize or murmur is like slashing your wrists. Your life will ebb away. It is not for you to evaluate whether the church is high or low, or whether the brothers are spiritual or fleshly. Your business is to abide in Him. If the church is really poor, by your abiding it will be uplifted and enriched. The remedy for the church comes from the abiding.<p>Stay in this divine place, involving the two spirits. Worship here. Receive the instant word of the Lord. As you live in Him and He dwells in you, there is a mutual abode. In this place you are holy. Your Christ will be no longer merely doctrinal. He will be your experience all the time. You will be able to testify that you are one with Him and He with you, even that you are abiding in this oneness.<p>I believe we have all experienced abiding in this way. The problem has been that we have not made it a constant matter. Now we must come to the place of constant abiding. The whole world will be under our feet! We shall not utter a vain word. Whatever we are will be Christ. Whatever we do will be Christ. Whatever we say will be Christ. &#8220;For to me to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21) will be our testimony. Galatians 2:20 will be true of us, that we have been crucified with Christ, nevertheless we live; yet not we, but Christ lives in us. It will be hard to distinguish whether this is He or we. We and He are one. This is the abiding. The Lord&#8217;s recovery needs this. There is the need of this abiding life that the church life may be enriched.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>HOW TO LIVE BY CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16, 2, 4, 6; Gal. 5:16, 25; John 6:57; 5:19a, 30</h1><h2 class=head1>POSSIBLE!</h2><p>To live by Christ is possible. Yet many Christians do not know this reality. Though the term &#8220;to live by Christ&#8221; sounds familiar to us because of our having heard it so much, it is nonetheless a great matter. How can we live by another? Humanly speaking, there is no possibility for a wife, for example, to live by her husband, or for a husband to live by his wife. The husband has his own life, and the wife has hers. There are two sets of emotions involved and two wills. In spite of this impossibility for two human beings, Christians can live by another life. To live by Christ means to live Christ. It is possible!<p>Galatians 2:20 is an oft-quoted verse: &#8220;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.&#8221; When it is true in our experience that it is &#8220;not I, but Christ&#8221; who is living in us, then there are two persons living together, but having only one life and one living.<p>How could there be only one living? Let us again use married life as an example. Even to decide how to spend a day together takes some negotiations! The husband may want to stay home, but the wife may want to go shopping. The husband may have to do some persuading to get his wife to stay home with him. It is hard for two persons to have only one living.<h2 class=head1>ONE LIFE AND ONE LIVING</h2><p>To live by Christ means that the Christian and Christ have one life and one living. John 6:57 says, &#8220;As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me.&#8221; The words &#8220;because of&#8221; can also be translated &#8220;by.&#8221; The Father sent the Son, and the Son was now living by the Father; so the one who ate the Son would also live by the Son.<p>The Father and the Son are two Persons, yet they had but one life and one living. The Father was the life of the Son, and the Son was the living of the Father. Life refers to the inner substance, living to the outward expression. The Father was the living substance within, and the Son was the living expression of the Father.<p>John 14:10 says, &#8220;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works.&#8221; There was One on this earth who lived the life of Another: the Son lived the Father&#8217;s life. The Son lived because the Father was living.<h2 class=head1>NEVERTHELESS...YET...BUT</h2><p>Grafting illustrates these two lives. We were the wild olive branches, but we have been grafted into the best tree (Rom. 11:17, 24). We have not exchanged our poor life for a better one. Nor has our life been terminated, and only His is left. Yes, Galatians 2:20 does say that we have been crucified with Christ; but this termination is not final. Crucifixion is the threshold of resurrection. Crucifixion is followed by &#8220;nevertheless...yet...but&#8221;! Where does this leave us? In the tomb or in resurrection? Dead or living? We live, yet not we. The words may sound illogical, but Christ and His members know the secret.<h2 class=head1>&#8220;NOTHING FROM HIMSELF&#8221;</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was a person of strong character. He had a distinct personality. His will was strong. His emotions were strong enough that He could weep. His mind was clear and sober. His words were eloquent. Yet this striking Person said, &#8220;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, this also the Son does in like manner....I can do nothing from Myself&#8221; (John 5:19, 30). The Son lived by another Person&#8217;s life. His own person was not His life. This One of such strong character did not live by Himself. He lived by the Father; He lived the Father. It was in this way that the Son expressed the Father. The Father&#8217;s life was revealed in the Son&#8217;s living.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S ONLY CONCERN</h2><p>This is the principle which should govern our living also. We may have a strong character, but we must live by Him, not by ourselves. After I was saved, I began to seek after holiness. Because I am a quick person, I would easily lose my temper. I hated my hot temper and wanted desperately to be victorious over it. Now I have come to realize that God&#8217;s intention is not for me to be victorious or spiritual. His intention is that I live Christ. My problem was not that I was defeated, natural, and unholy. It was that I was short of Christ. In Christ victory over everything is mine. Holiness and practical spirituality are mine.<p>God, even from eternity past, never had the concept of gaining a group of &#8220;holy&#8221; people. God is not concerned about your &#8220;holiness.&#8221; If He wanted to, He could cure you of your temper without any effort on your part or on His.<p>What God wants is to have a people living by Christ that they may be Christ&#8217;s expression. There is a full picture of this in the Old Testament type of the tabernacle with the ark. In the wilderness over two million Israelites went from place to place, carrying the tabernacle. They would reach a certain point and then encamp around that tabernacle. Day after day this was all they did. They were victorious over their enemies. They had God with them in the pillar of fire by night and in the pillar of cloud by day. The tabernacle was God&#8217;s testimony. When the children of Israel were right with the tabernacle, all went well. When they neglected it, they were carnal, worldly, and defeated.<p>Today all too many Christians are ignorant of this testimony. God wants us to live by Another&#8217;s life. He wants Christ to be our life, our love, our kindness, our righteousness, and our holiness. He does not want us to aspire after any thing; in Christ is all we need.<h2 class=head1>CHANGING OUR CONCEPTS</h2><p>Yet you are concerned about losing your temper. You keep regretting that you have not kept your marriage vow to love your wife or to submit to your husband. How you need your concepts changed! For you to live is Christ, not spirituality. For you to live is Christ, not love for your wife or submission to your husband. Stop trying to be even-tempered. God does not care about your being delivered from your temper. A statue never loses its temper, however much it is insulted. Do you think God wants you to be like that? God wants you to be full of Christ! Even if you are a very hot-tempered person, you can still live Christ. What we need is what God wants-Christ. God wants Christ to be lived out of us.<p class=hbody>There&#8217;s a Man in the glory<br>Whose Life is for me.<br>His peace is abiding;<br>How patient is He!<br>He&#8217;s joyful and radiant,<br>Expecting to see<br>His Life in the glory<br>Lived out in me.</p><p class=hbody>Hymns, #505</p><p>God wants a people corporately living Christ. This vision, which was made so clear the first ten years of the recovery in this country, must be recovered. May we all re-see the vision.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY PREPARED</h2><p>God did many things to make it possible for us to live Christ. He had to create the heavens, the earth, and man. Then He Himself had to become incarnate. The infinite God lived in humanity for thirty-three and a half years! Then one day He went to the cross. God in the flesh entered into death by crucifixion. After death, He entered into resurrection, ascension, enthronement, and glorification. Now our God has become the life-giving Spirit. He is ready to enter into all those who open up to believe in Him. &#8220;O God, I am a sinner. O Lord Jesus, You are My Savior. You died on the cross for me.&#8221; Whoever opens himself to this extent will have this life-giving One enter into the inmost part of him, his spirit. He comes into us with all His involvements and all His virtues.<p>His involvements include eternity, creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, with the enthronement and the crowning. He is our God, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Lord, our Master, and our Father. He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. His virtues include life, light, love, grace, truth, holiness, righteousness, victory, and humility.<p>This life-giving Spirit is in our spirit. The two spirits are mingled, making us one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). In ourselves we are sinful and insignificant. We are nobodies in a vast universe. Yet we are one spirit with the Lord. This profound fact should be a factor affecting our living. Christ today is both in the heavens and in us, just as electricity is in the power plant and also in the building. He is prevailing in us because He is in the power plant of the heavens.<p>This is the message you need to tell people! You are the Lord&#8217;s spokesman to tell others that He is living, real, available, and within us. Have you ever told your parents this? You are silent and passive because you do not pray. Christ is living! Pray to Him! If you pray even for a half hour, you will see what happens. The motor within will start up!<p>&#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God&#8221; (Rom. 8:16). What a wonder that the divine Spirit is one with our human spirit!<h2 class=head1>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2><p>How can we live by Christ? It is simply by walking according to this mingled spirit which is within us (Rom. 8:4).<h2 class=head2>In Our Relationships with Others</h2><p>Let me illustrate. Suppose two brothers come to me after they have had a disagreement. They tell me their story and want me to settle the problem. I can handle them in two ways. I can listen to them, trying to discern which one is right. I watch their eyes and their facial expressions to be sure they are not lying. If this is my way of dealing with people, I am living by myself; this is a human way. The other way is to listen while inwardly I am praying. &#8220;Lord, I would live by You. I have been crucified with You. Now You live in me. What would You say to these brothers? What do You realize concerning them? What would You do with them?&#8221; This constant, inward turning to the Lord is what is meant by praying unceasingly. Not only so. I have my natural discernment, by which I could read their hearts. But I further say to the Lord, &#8220;Lord, I do not want to live by myself. I want to go by what You feel, what You discern, what You see. I want to say what You would say to them.&#8221;<p>Suppose, further, that while the brothers are talking to me, my temper is aroused by what they say. I am about to rebuke them, but I sense that I am not abiding in Christ. In this situation I do not do or say anything. Rather, within I pray, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. My natural man has come to the surface. Lord, cover me. Be my person. Be my life.&#8221;<p>After I have been listening to these two brothers in an attitude of prayer and oneness with the Lord, He will lead me to say a word to them. What it would be, I do not know. The Lord is living and flexible. Whatever He would say through me will be either light shining over them or life supplied to them within. The result will be that both of them are enlightened, nourished, and supplied with life.<h2 class=head2>In Our Family Life</h2><p>Let us take another example. You come home from work exhausted after an eight-hour day. Your wife has been home taking care of all the children; she too is worn out. The stage is set for friction. If you walk in the door and do not say anything, she will be offended. She will want to know why you are so calm, or what you are afraid of. If you walk in and say &#8220;Praise the Lord!&#8221; that will offend her too. How come you had such a good day while she has been home suffering?<p>On the other hand, she on her part may be wondering how to greet you when you get home. She does not know if you will be in a good mood or depressed. This is a common situation we face all the time as human beings. How do we as Christians handle it? &#8220;Lord, thank You You are with me. When my husband gets home, You have to be the One who meets him. Be the One who lives in me. I don&#8217;t want to live myself. I want to live Your life. I want to express You in my living.&#8221;<p>There is no need to figure out how you will meet your husband or wife at the end of the day. Practice, rather, to live Christ. I have been doing so for many years. To tell the truth, it is not easy. We are buried under the layers of our culture, religion, and spiritual seeking. We must turn away from these distractions, no longer caring for religion, philosophy, ethics, and human virtues.<h2 class=head1>HELPED BY A GOOD ATMOSPHERE</h2><p>Why do we need to fellowship with the Lord? Why do we need to have fellowship with the saints? Why do we need to come to the meetings? Why do we need to have the church life? All these things prepare a good environment for us to live Christ. If we want plants to grow, for example, they must have the proper soil, water, and light. With the right atmosphere, the plants will flourish. For our growth in Christ, for our help in living Christ, we need Bible reading, prayer, fellowship, and the meetings. With these providing the atmosphere, we are encouraged to remain in the spirit, contacting the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THROUGHOUT THE DAY</h2><p>As you converse with Him, open, prepared, and available, He will work in you, speaking and reacting. He will be living through you and expressing Himself through you. You and He, He and you, will have one life and one living. You will take Him as your life, and He will have you for His living. He is your life within; you are His living without.<p>This kind of life should not be occasional or accidental. This must be our regular life from morning till evening. Remain in Him. Do not be distracted by the mood of those around you. Keep focused on Him, conversing with Him. This is the Christian life.<h2 class=head1>THE VINE AND THE BRANCHES</h2><p>Do remember well that the basic revelation of the Scriptures is the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man that He may be man&#8217;s life and that man may be His living as His corporate expression. This is the vine and the branches revealed in John 15.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST, THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 16:25-26; Eph. 5:32; Col. 2:2-3, 9; 1:27; Eph. 3:3-4, 9; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:4, 6</h1><p>In the writings of Paul the word mystery often recurs. In Romans 16:25-26 he says that &#8220;the mystery, which has been kept in silence in times of the ages,&#8221; has now &#8220;been manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations unto obedience of faith.&#8221; There is a mystery, then, hidden in times past but now, according to the command of the eternal God, made known to man. This passage does not tell us much else about the mystery.<p>Ephesians and Colossians further expand the meaning of this mystery. Ephesians 5:32 says, &#8220;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&#8221; There are two parties to this mystery: Christ and the church. Then Paul prayed that the Colossians might fully understand and know &#8220;the mystery of God, Christ, in Whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden&#8221; (2:2-3). The mystery concerning Christ, then, is the mystery of God. Ephesians 3 has three references to the word mystery. &#8220;That by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written previously in brief, by which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ....And to bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, Who created all things&#8221; (vv. 3-4, 9). By putting these passages in Colossians and Ephesians together, we can see that the mystery has two aspects. There is the mystery of God, which is Christ, and there is the mystery of Christ, which is the church. Christ and the church, then, are the mystery.<h2 class=head1>EXPLAINING THE UNIVERSE</h2><p>A mystery is something hidden, hard to understand, or difficult to explain. Thoughtful people have always wondered what the meaning of the universe is. Why do the heavens exist? Why is there an earth? Why are there plants and animals and so many other things? Why are we here? What is the meaning of human life?<p>Philosophers and teachers have put out a great many books, dealing with this mystery, in an attempt to explain the universe and the meaning of life. They have done a poor job! The mystery is still hidden from them.<p>Scientists, too, have labored to grasp the nature of the universe and the reason for life. Their mentality is exhausted in trying to comprehend the universe, yet they still have discovered very little.<h2 class=head1>EXPLAINING MAN</h2><p>You are also a mystery. Can you believe that there is no meaning to your existence? If there is none, why do you have such a good mentality? Why do you have so many faculties, like two eyes and two ears? Surely your life has meaning. You do not exist merely to get dressed or to fill up on hamburgers!<p>The reason for man&#8217;s existence still baffles the philosophers.<h2 class=head1>THE MYSTERY ONCE HIDDEN NOW REVEALED</h2><p>The mystery of the universe, Paul tells us, has been hidden &#8220;from the ages&#8221; (Eph. 3:9) and was not made known &#8220;in other generations&#8221; (3:5). This means that it was hidden from eternity (the ages) and from the earlier generations of time. Even the angels did not know. Nor did Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, or even the wise Solomon. Isaiah and the other prophets were in ignorance of this mystery too, as was John the Baptist.<p>This mystery was hidden in God Himself. He alone knew about it.<p>It is not insignificant that today this mystery has been made known. We know about it from the Bible. Yet, sad to say, even many Christian teachers and scholars do not see this mystery, in spite of their having read through the Bible perhaps a good number of times. It is possible to see the black and white letters without seeing the mystery. Paul uses a variety of terms to convey what this mystery, now revealed, is. He refers to it as economy, dispensation, purpose, will, pleasure, desire, and intent.<h2 class=head1>THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD</h2><p>To say that Christ is the mystery of God is to say that He is God&#8217;s definition and explanation. God is unknown, but Christ is His expression and embodiment. Yes, Christ is God; He is also God&#8217;s description and embodiment. Apart from Him we cannot find God. This is the problem of our Jewish friends. They put Christ aside, yet insist they have God. They do not have God, because He can only be realized in Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE TRINITY A MYSTERY</h2><p>The Trinity has been a puzzle to Christian scholars since the first century. Even in the first chapter of Genesis we find the Trinity hinted at. The word God in Hebrew is in plural number, not singular. Then in verse 26 the three pronouns referring to God are plural: &#8220;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&#8221; How could the one God refer to Himself as &#8220;us&#8221;? Why does He use a plural possessive &#8220;our&#8221;? This problem has bothered the scholars for centuries.<h2 class=head2>The Threefold Name</h2><p>Let us come to the New Testament. One day after His resurrection, just before He ascended to the heavens, the Lord Jesus met with His disciples on a mountain in Galilee. There He charged them to go and &#8220;disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Matt. 28:19). Notice that the Three are here, yet &#8220;name&#8221; is singular. There is something of a mystery about this name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Father and the Son</h2><p>Even earlier the Lord was talking with His disciples on one occasion and told them He would be going away. This news troubled them. In answer to Thomas&#8217; question, Jesus said, &#8220;I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me&#8221; (see John 14:1-6). At this point Philip asked that they be shown the Father; the disciples would be satisfied if the Lord would do this for them. The Lord replied, in effect, &#8220;What do you mean, &#8216;Show us the Father&#8217;? I&#8217;ve been with you for three years or so. Why do you ask to see the Father?&#8221; Then He said, &#8220;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works&#8221; (v. 10).<p>Notice, however, that the Lord does not say that He is the Father. When I would read John 14, sometimes I would ask the Lord, &#8220;Lord, why didn&#8217;t You just plainly say, &#8216;I am the Father&#8217;?&#8221; His reply to Philip seems so roundabout. If He had directly said He was the Father, it would have prevented much theological debating all these centuries! But the Lord is not that simple! Nor is the Trinity that simple!<p>Suppose some of you say, &#8220;Brother Lee, show us Witness Lee. Then we&#8217;ll be satisfied.&#8221; I would reply, &#8220;What! I&#8217;ve been speaking to you all this time, and you still want me to show you Witness Lee! Don&#8217;t you know that Brother Lee is in Witness Lee, and Witness Lee is in Brother Lee? When you see the one, you see the other.&#8221; Yet I will not come out and say that Brother Lee is Witness Lee. To do so would mean that I could be easily explained!<h2 class=head2>The Spirit and the Son</h2><p>Later on in this same chapter, the Lord says, &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...the Spirit of reality&#8221; (John 14:16-17). Yet in the very next verse He says that He Himself is coming (v. 18). One verse indicates that it is the Spirit who is coming, and the next verse declares that the Lord is coming.<p>This confusing way of talking continues with regard to who it is who will be in the disciples. Verse 17 says that the Spirit of reality &#8220;shall be in you,&#8221; whereas in verse 20 the Lord says, &#8220;In that day you shall know that I am...in you.&#8221; The Spirit&#8217;s indwelling the disciples meant the Lord&#8217;s indwelling of them. Yet the Lord does not openly say that He is the Spirit or that the Spirit is simply Himself. He chooses to talk in this mysterious way, making us wonder whether there are Two in us, the Spirit and Himself, or only One.<h2 class=head1>PAUL&#8217;S REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY</h2><p>Paul, the great apostle who received the revelation concerning this mystery, refers to Christ in the flesh as the last Adam (1 Cor. 15:45). Our forefather Adam was the first Adam. The last Adam, Paul says, became a life-giving Spirit. In the same book he says, &#8220;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:17). He further tells Timothy, &#8220;The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit&#8221; (2 Tim. 4:22). From these verses it is clear that the Lord must be the Spirit and also that we must have a spirit. Otherwise, how could we be one spirit with Him, and how could He be with our spirit?<p>&#8220;Christ in you&#8221; (Col. 1:27) is another word of Paul&#8217;s. Is he speaking figuratively? How could we possibly contain Christ? However mysterious it sounds, it is a fact that Christ is in us; we can testify to this mysterious reality. He is like the electricity that makes the lamps give light; we cannot explain how it works, but we experience its benefits.<p>In Galatians 2:20 Paul goes a step further. &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&#8221; Christ is not only within us; He is living in us. Paul is describing his experience. Can we also testify that Christ lives in us? Does having Christ live in us seem like a strange way of talking, or is this our reality?<h2 class=head1>GOD REACHING MAN</h2><p>God had no way to reach us except through Christ. Christ as the Spirit is the reaching of God to us. God firstly passed through creation; before then He was not the Creator, but only God. By creating the world and all the things in it, He took a step to reach us. Then at a certain time He took a further step, the incarnation. By this means He became one with one of His creatures, man. That is why He was called Emmanuel, meaning God with us (Matt. 1:23); God the Creator became a man. He lived in a carpenter&#8217;s humble home for thirty years. Then He came forth to minister, passing through the villages in Galilee and Judea. As a man He tasted all the aspects of human life. Then through the cross He entered into death. That wonderful death terminated all the things of the old creation. He descended into the lower parts of the earth. After three days He emerged from death and entered into resurrection. At this point He was transfigured. From being a man in the flesh, He became a Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). With all these experiences, He ascended into the heavens, where He was crowned, enthroned, and glorified. God gave Him the highest name and made Him not only Lord but also Head over all things.<p>His story is still not over! On the day of Pentecost He descended from that throne. He reached us, God&#8217;s chosen people and the believers in Christ. He has entered into us and is now one with us. He indwells us. Such is Jesus Christ, the mystery of God.<h2 class=head1>TWO COMMANDMENTS</h2><p>In the New Testament we are not given ten commandments. To those who are under the New Testament economy, God&#8217;s word is that they believe in His Son. Not to believe is disobedience and rebellion against God. To perish there is no need to rob a bank, commit fornication, or to tell lies. It is sufficient to refuse to believe in Jesus Christ. Even if you are a model human being, living a highly ethical life, if you will not believe in the Lord Jesus, you will perish. God&#8217;s only command to those who are not saved is that they believe in His Son.<p>After we are saved, this same principle holds true. God is not interested in our doing. He has one commandment for us. What He wants is that we live Christ. Yet if we think back on the number of times we have repented, we shall realize that our repentance has mostly been over our failure to be loving, or humble, or honest. Do we repent for our failure to live Christ? For all too many of us, this is not in our concept. We are ethics-centered, not Christ-centered. As Christians, we should be &#8220;Christ-men,&#8221; but from our way of living perhaps we could more accurately be called &#8220;moral men&#8221;!<h2 class=head1>HINDRANCES TO LIVING BY CHRIST</h2><p>You may feel that for years you have heard of living by Christ. You may have a heart to do so. In fact, you may have tried and tried again to live Him. Yet your efforts have been unsuccessful and you have given up. Why is it that you have not succeeded?<p>It is because we are buried in a seven-layered tomb! The first layer is the fall of man. The second layer is our natural life. After man was created, he fell; because of the fall, he has his natural life, with its own inclinations and intentions. The third layer, and the thickest, is human culture. To live by the culture into which we were born comes naturally; but to live Christ seems like a strange notion to us. The fourth layer is religion, which also affects all mankind. Whether we are very set in our religion, like the Moslems, or consider ourselves atheists, we nonetheless are religious. The fifth layer is ethics or morality. The concept of morality is imbedded deep in our being. To be pleasant and considerate of others is needed in human society, but in order to live Christ we must be above ethical considerations. The sixth layer of our tomb is our virtues, closely related to ethics. What we esteem as virtues others may not agree with. We may appreciate patience, but others may regard quickness as a virtue. We may like humility, but others may think ambition is desirable. Whatever our virtues, they are a layer of the tomb in which we are buried. The last layer of the tomb is spiritual seeking. To seek holiness, victory, and spirituality can be a layer of the tomb that buries us from the living Christ.<h2 class=head1>PRAYER AND VISION</h2><p>To get from under these seven layers of the tomb requires prayer. Yet how shall we pray? We may resolve to live Christ and then begin our day by praying, &#8220;Lord, help me to love my wife today.&#8221; To have such an attitude is a help to human society, but it is altogether a frustration to our living Christ. Even if we pray, &#8220;Lord, we want to have the best church life,&#8221; this praying too is a frustration. To make up our minds to love our wives, or to improve the church life, or to achieve anything, prevents us from living by Christ.<p>Do not pray for this and that. Simply pray that you may be infused with Christ and by Him. Pray by contacting Him. Then, as each day goes by, without your intending to do or be anything, you will live and move and have your being in the Spirit. Spontaneously you will fulfill His commandment, &#8220;Walk by the Spirit&#8221; (Gal. 5:16). Christ will be lived out of you. Your whole being will be set upon your spirit (Rom. 8:6). With your mind set upon your spirit, there will be the living by Christ. This is what God wants.<p>To live by Christ is the crucial focus of God&#8217;s economy. The New Testament centers on the fact that the all-inclusive Christ as the processed God is now dwelling in our spirit. We are one spirit with Him. All He wants us to do is to live Him. We may try to have an impressive church life, but if we are devoid of this living by Christ, the recovery is still empty. The content of the recovery is this very living by Christ, this Christ who is the all-inclusive Spirit and the mystery of God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE CHURCH, THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:15a, 16a; 2:20a; 4:19; Col. 1:27; 3:4a, 11; Phil. 1:20b-21a; Eph. 3:17a, 19b; 1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:8-11, 6, 4</h1><p>Without God there is no explanation for the universe. Where did the heavens come from? Where did the earth come from? How did man get here? The answer to all such questions is God.<p>The mystery of the universe is God. The mystery of God, the Scripture tells us, is Christ (Col. 2:2). The mystery of Christ, we are further told, is the church (Eph. 3:4, 6). Actually these are simply three stages of one mystery. God is to be found in Christ. Christ is to be found in the church. The church, then, is the mystery of Christ, who in turn is the mystery of God, who Himself is the mystery of the universe.<h2 class=head1>EXPERIENCING THE MYSTERY</h2><p>The Apostle Paul, of all the New Testament writers, speaks most clearly about this mystery. His words are bold yet honest. He speaks from experience. Notice how the Scriptures we have listed above deal with experience rather than doctrine. &#8220;It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me....Christ lives in me....Christ is formed in you....Christ in you, the hope of glory...Christ our life...Christ shall be magnified in my body....For to me to live is Christ....Christ may make His home in your hearts...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God....He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&#8221;<p>All these words are clear, yet when you consider them carefully, you will realize that they convey a mystery. Are you really one spirit with the Lord Jesus, for example? Can you declare, as Paul did, &#8220;To me to live is Christ&#8221;? How could even Paul say this? He was Saul of Tarsus. For him to make such a statement there must have been some fact, some experience, backing his word. Furthermore, how could Christ be magnified, that is, expressed and enlarged, in your body? How could your inner being become a home for Christ? We are speaking of a mystery.<p>When Christ came, He told people He was God (John 5:17-18; 10:30, 33). God had always been a mystery. Now a little Nazarene stood before His fellow men and said He was God. No wonder the Jews could not believe. Was He truly God? He surely was! He was the reality of God, God expressed and embodied.<p>After entering into death, resurrection, and ascension, He descended to reach His believers and make them one with Himself. That is why one of His believers could declare, &#8220;To me to live is Christ.&#8221; One day a man from Nazareth had declared that He was God. Now here was a man by the name of Saul of Tarsus, declaring that to him to live was Christ.<p>It is no wonder that the Jews told Christ that He was blaspheming to say that He was God. We too have been accused of blaspheming for saying that to us to live is Christ. In ancient times it was the religious Jews who condemned the Lord Jesus for blasphemy. In our day it is also the religious ones who condemn us. In both cases it is because they do not see the mystery.<p>You may be told that you are a saint like Theresa, or that you are an angel. People will not protest if they hear that. But if you say, &#8220;To me to live is Christ,&#8221; they will object that you are going too far, that you are saying something blasphemous, or that you are asking to be worshipped.<p>It is no blasphemy to say that we are one spirit with the Lord Jesus. It is a fact! It is a shame if for us to live is a &#8220;saint,&#8221; or for us to live is an angel. God wants us to live Christ! He has enough &#8220;holy&#8221; people and enough angels.<p>He has enough Texans and enough Chinese! He wants His chosen people, wherever they are from, to live Christ, not their culture or their virtues.<h2 class=head1>THE FOCUS OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>What God wants is a Person, not some thing. This Person is beyond our understanding. He is the infinite, eternal God. He is the Creator. Yet He became flesh. He lived on this earth. He passed through death, subdued it, and entered into resurrection. Then He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). As such, He has entered into us and now lives in our spirit. Once He has entered us, He will never leave. He not only stays, but wants to settle down. He wants to make His home in all the inner chambers of our heart-our mind, our emotion, and our will.<p>This is the heart of the Bible. You may forget the story of Enoch, for example, but do not forget this focal point. If I lose an ear, I can still live; but if my heart is removed, I am through. Too many Christians today are dealing with the little finger, or even a fingernail of the little finger! They argue about whether the nail is square or triangular. They write books to prove that it is half round and half square! But the heart they disregard. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is to bring us back to the heart. Do not argue about the ten toes! Come back to the heart: God, the mystery of the universe; Christ, the mystery of God; the church, the mystery of Christ; and we His people, living Him.<h2 class=head1>THE KEY TO SEEING THE VISION</h2><p>Do you want this vision to be clear to you? Pray! But do not focus your prayer on things, persons, or situations. Give yourself to pray over these verses. You may pray, &#8220;Lord, it pleased You to reveal Christ in me. This was a pleasure to God. God was pleased. God was pleased not to teach me, but to reveal. Reveal! Reveal His Son, not Theresa, not an angel, but His Son! In me, not in my mind, but in me!&#8221; If you will pray-read in this way, you will become excited. You will realize you are no ordinary person. You will want to declare to the universe that you have Christ in you. You will become Christ-conscious and Christ-centered. Your pride in being an American, or a Texan, or a Scot will fade away. It pleased God to reveal His Son in you! His Son!<p>By pray-reading all the verses we have listed at the beginning of the message, your mind and even your whole being will be set upon the spirit. You will be saturated with a view of Christ as the mystery of God. You will realize that Christ is in you as your life. Do not wonder how you can be rid of the seven layers that keep you in the tomb! As you read and pray, they will all drop off with no further effort on your part.<p>While you are praying, the understanding will come. As you digest and assimilate these verses, you will enjoy their riches. Though their words are clear, they convey a mystery. How could Christ make His home in your heart? How could you be filled unto all the fullness of God? As you pray, you will realize that &#8220;unto all the fullness of God&#8221; means &#8220;resulting in the proper church life.&#8221; All the fullness of God is the Body of Christ, the church, the fullness of Him that fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). When Christ makes His home in your heart, then, the result will be the proper church life.<p>Take Colossians 3:11 for another example. Here it says that in the new man &#8220;there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&#8221; As you pray over this verse, your view of the church will become clear. The church is the new man, not an organization but the Body of Christ, an organism. In this new man Christ is all and in all. The church is Christ, being all-that is, being you, me, and every other believer-and being in all, that is, being in every one of us.<p>Pray yourself into these verses and pray them into you. Then you will see that what God wants is Christ, not the Christ of knowledge and doctrine, but the Christ of experience. This Christ must be mingled with you. He must saturate you with all He is. Once you have this view, it kills ethics, religion, human culture, natural virtues, and even your spiritual seeking. In this vision only Christ survives.<p>Even though nearly two thousand years have gone by, the Lord Jesus still does not have what He is after. There may be millions of Christians, but few pay attention to this focus of the biblical revelation. Will you bestir yourself to get into this focus? Will you lay other things aside and deal with the Lord about these verses? &#8220;Lord, reveal this matter in Galatians 1:15a and 16a to me. I know this is serious, but I don&#8217;t fully grasp it. Infuse me with what it means.&#8221; Pray this way over all these verses until they are a part of your being. Then you will realize how pitiful the situation among Christians is. You will see that they are off, caring for minor matters and neglecting the heart. May we be those who see the focus of the Bible.<h2 class=head1>THE TRINITY AND MAN</h2><p>Notice these verses in Romans 8: &#8220;And those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you.&#8221;<p>The names used for God in these verses deserve our attention. First it says that those in the flesh cannot please God. God is the term used in verse 8. In verse 9, however, it says that the Spirit of God dwells in you and that one must have the Spirit of Christ to be of Him. God is God the Father, and the Spirit of God is God the Spirit. Spirit of Christ is interchangeable with Spirit of God. Verse 10 says that Christ is in you. The Spirit of Christ is therefore Christ Himself. Whether He is called God, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, or Christ, all these terms used here clearly indicate that God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into man is related to His being triune.<p>In verse 11 the Trinity is referred to again. &#8220;Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead&#8221; is God, whose Spirit dwells in you. Christ Jesus, who was raised from among the dead, is the Son. &#8220;He Who raised Christ&#8221; is another reference to God, who will also &#8220;give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&#8221;<p>The Trinity-God, Christ, and the Spirit-is for giving life to you. Firstly He gives life to your spirit (v. 10) and eventually life to your body (v. 11). In the middle is the mind, which, if set on the spirit, is life and peace (v. 6). The spirit is life, the mind is life, and even the body is life. The Triune God dispenses Himself as life into tripartite man.<p>Can you see the need for the Trinity? God must be Father, Son, and Spirit for the dispensing of Himself into man. He firstly comes into the center, our spirit; then spreads into our mind; and eventually saturates our body, the circumference.<h2 class=head1>ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2><p>Romans 8:4 tells us, &#8220;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.&#8221; The spirit here is our regenerated spirit, now indwelt by Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit. Here in our spirit we are one spirit with Him, mingled with Him.<p>Stop your preoccupation with loving your wife, or submitting to your husband, or being kind and patient. Simplify your Christian life by walking according to spirit. Pray and trust and wait on the Lord. Tell Him, &#8220;Lord, I am tired of making up my mind to do things. I want to stop all my doing. I trust in You. I wait on You. I want to live, and move, and have my being according to the spirit.&#8221; Do not try to walk according to some verse in the Bible, attempting to obey what it says without walking according to spirit.<p>The result of walking according to spirit will be that Christ is expressed. You will find it true that to you to live is Christ. Whether your circumstances are peaceful or troublesome, do not be disturbed. Let it suffice that any circumstances are good for you to live Christ and for Him to be magnified in your body.<p>This is the Christian life according to the universal mystery.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><p>The mystery of Christ is the church. We as members of the church must live according to spirit. This living is not individualistic. The more we live Christ, the more we are aware that we are in the Body. As Colossians 3:11 tells us, in this new man there is no room for the natural man with his national characteristics. What is the church life? It is Christ being all of us and being in all of us. Living by Christ spontaneously issues in the church life.<p>Paul&#8217;s prayer in Ephesians 3:19 is that &#8220;you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.&#8221; The result of your being filled will be the fullness of God, that is, the proper and living church life.<p>The key point is to walk according to spirit. Yet to do this you need a clear view concerning Christ and the church. This vision will come to you only through prayer. Pray-read these verses. Forget about praying for your personal concerns and your anxieties. God will take care of all these other matters. Pray regarding this one matter. Pray-read these verses till you see that Christ is the mystery of God and that the church is the mystery of Christ. Then you will realize that Christ is the all-inclusive One-the infinite, eternal God, the Creator, the incarnated One, the crucified One, the resurrected One who has become the life-giving Spirit, the One in ascension who has entered into your being and is now indwelling your spirit and making you one spirit with Him. All things have been accomplished by Him.<p>If we have our being according to this one spirit, we shall live out Christ. The church life will be the outcome. There will be the church as the new man, with Christ as the content. Then the church will indeed be the fullness of God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST IN THE FOUR FOCAL BOOKS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:13-16a; 2:20a; 4:19; Col. 2:2, 6-9; 3:4, 11; Phil. 1:19-21a; 3:7-8; Eph. 3:8-11, 17a, 19b</h1><p>These four books that are arranged together in our New Testament-Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians-are the heart of God&#8217;s revelation. They tell us that Christ and the church are the focal point of the divine revelation. The Apostle Paul, through whom this mystery has been revealed, tells us that until the New Testament economy this mystery was hidden in God (Eph. 1:9).<p>What is it that hinders our seeing this mystery, even though it has been fully revealed?<h2 class=head1>GALATIANS</h2><p>The first hindrance is religion, which is what Paul deals with in Galatians. When the Lord Jesus came, there was among the Jewish people a religion, not pagan, but one formed and established according to God&#8217;s word. The basic element of the Jewish religion was the law, which was given by God. In addition, there were the traditions made by man. This religion, with its God-given law and its man-made traditions, was the strongest opponent to the Lord Jesus and His ministry.<p>Later, when the apostles went forth to preach the gospel, most of their opposition came from these same Jewish religionists, not from the heathen. It was in order to preserve the traditions inherited from their fathers and the law given by God that these Judaizers tried their hardest to resist the evangelists and the gospel they preached.<h2 class=head2>Snatched out of Religion</h2><p>One of their number, an aggressive, offensive young man named Saul of Tarsus, was heading one day for Damascus, intending to bring back the disciples of Jesus who were there, to Jerusalem to be punished. Such was his intention, and he was proceeding on his way to carry it out. Yes, he did have the freedom to make up his mind to do this; but to bring it about was not up to him. His mission was interrupted by a heavenly Visitor! Falling to the earth, Saul addressed this One from the heavens as Lord: &#8220;Who art thou, Lord?&#8221; (Acts 9:5). The answer was, &#8220;I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.&#8221; Saul thought he was persecuting the disciples of Jesus; now he found out that he had been persecuting Jesus Himself.<p>On that day something happened to Saul not only outwardly, but also inwardly. Outwardly he was knocked down and blinded by the brightness of the light. But from Galatians 1 we can see that something happened inwardly as well. He tells us, &#8220;I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it; and I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers&#8221; (Gal. 1:13-14). He was doing well in his religious zeal, when God came in. &#8220;It pleased God,&#8221; he tells us, &#8220;to reveal His Son in me&#8221; (vv. 15-16). Inwardly a vision was imparted to him.<h2 class=head2>Christ versus Religion</h2><p>What was the vision? It was Christ versus religion. Religion is the highest invention of human culture. Yet Christ stands in opposition to it. Christ is against the law and against tradition. He has nothing to do with religion. Through all these centuries since then, this battle between Christ and religion has been going on. Religion hates Christ. If you hold on to your religion, you miss Christ. If you cherish Christ, religion hates you.<p>Saul of Tarsus was snatched out of religion by Christ. While he was surpassing his contemporaries in religious zeal, Christ not only laid hold of him but also imparted His life to him.<h2 class=head2>Revealed, Living, Formed</h2><p>In his letter to the Galatians, Paul speaks of his experience of having the Son revealed to him. Then in 2:20 he tells how he has experienced Christ living in him: &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&#8221; Christ was revealed to him and then was living in him. A further development is indicated in 4:19, where he says, &#8220;My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you.&#8221; Christ was already formed in him, but not in the Galatians. It is not adequate, then, to have Christ revealed in us and living in us. He must also be formed in us.<p>Romans 9 tells us that we are vessels God has made (vv. 20-23). We human beings were made to be containers of Christ. We are like a glove, designed to contain a hand. For a hand to be formed in the glove, the thumb and the fingers must be fitted into the glove exactly. Two fingers of the glove must not dangle empty! Has the Christ who has come into us been formed in us?<h2 class=head2>Our Own Commandments</h2><p>Perhaps some of you have not yet been snatched out of religion. I am sure that you are not trying to keep the law of Moses, but you may well have your own laws. You may have made up more than ten commandments that you are trying to keep. You try to be a gentleman. You try to suppress your bad temper. You try to love your wife. Are you still expecting to keep these laws? Do you think you have a way to do this? You pray for God&#8217;s help that He would so enable you, yet He does not seem to come in. Still you hold on to your laws.<p>What about the more recent commandments you have been trying to keep? You have been getting up early to spend time in the Word and in prayer. You have been reading three chapters in the Old Testament and one in the New. You have been setting time aside several times a day to pray. Do you think it is good to keep these laws? Well, you may say that I was the one who proposed these to you. Whether it is good to keep these laws I shall not venture to say, but if you are to experience Christ revealed in you, living in you, and formed in you, you must be snatched out of whatever laws you are trying to keep.<p>To say this may make the elders anxious lest the young people become loose and will no longer rise early for morning watch! After the law, however, comes Christ. Now we come to Christ!<p>The messages of Galatians, the first of these four books, is that we must be out of religion in order to have Christ revealed, living, and formed in us. He is apart from religion, law, and tradition.<h2 class=head1>COLOSSIANS</h2><p>Let us take the last of the four books next. Paul gives this warning to the Colossians: &#8220;Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ&#8221; (Col. 2:8). Not too long after the churches were established, various isms put in their appearance. When Paul refers to philosophy and the elements of the world, he means especially Gnosticism, mysticism, and asceticism. Gnosticism was a compilation of Jewish and heathen (Egyptian, Babylonian, and Greek) philosophical thought. Mysticism was also a philosophical belief with some mysterious elements in it. Asceticism was the severe treatment of the body. All these isms invaded the church and subtly began to replace Christ.<h2 class=head2>Christ versus Philosophy</h2><p>Paul wrote to declare that Christ stood in opposition to the Jewish religion, to Gnosticism, to mysticism, and to asceticism. He told the Colossians that Christ had nothing in common with philosophy; that He could not be compared to mysticism; and that asceticism had nothing to do with Him.<h2 class=head2>The Peerless Christ</h2><p>Christ is incomparable, Paul said. He is in a class apart. Who is Christ? He is the mystery of God. He is the embodiment of all the fullness of the Godhead. Who or what can be ranked with Him? This peerless One is our life. He is within us a mystery, the hope of glory. He is the component of the new man, the church. In the church there is no room for anyone but Him. In this new creation all others are excluded, both &#8220;Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman&#8221; (Col. 3:11). In this new man Christ is all and in all; that is, He is every member and He is in every member. Can anything or anyone be compared with such a Christ?<p>To value any other thing above Him is to be buried in a seven-layered tomb! These seven layers are implied in the religion, law, tradition, and philosophy which Paul condemns so strongly. The fall, the natural life, culture, religion, ethics, morality, virtues, and spiritual seeking-we need to be snatched out of all of these. They are burying us, even those of us who are Christians. We must be freed from these layers in which we are wrapped.<h2 class=head2>Frustrations to Experiencing Christ</h2><p>From Galatians we know that to live Christ has nothing to do with religion. From Colossians we know that to live Christ is entirely apart from philosophy. These two matters, religion and philosophy, are highly esteemed in society and are closely related to each other. Both are enemies of Christ. Both are frustrations to our experiencing Christ.<p>Do you realize that you must be out of religion, out of philosophy, and out of culture? This is not a doctrine for you to understand, but a reality for you to experience. If you still consider yourself as an American, you are still in your culture. The Bible says there is no room in the new man for any nationality, whether American, Chinese, or German. All the national and cultural distinctions have been buried. Now your status is Christ! He is all.<p>I trust that we have all gotten the message of these two books. We, as those who are living Christ, have nothing to do with religion, the law, its traditions, and regulations; nor have we anything to do with philosophy and culture.<h2 class=head1>PHILIPPIANS</h2><p>Philippians again brings up the matter of religion. Paul describes himself as &#8220;circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless&#8221; (Phil. 3:5-6). The word translated persecute here is the same as the word pursue. Before Paul was snatched out of religion, he was pursuing Christ in a negative way. After he got saved, his pursuit of Christ was positive.<p>Because Paul, in his pursuit of Christ, rejected religion, this book tells of sufferings, afflictions, and trials that came to him (1:12-13). Are troubles desirable? In nature they are not, but in function they are. The difficulties became golden opportunities for Paul not only to live Christ, but also to magnify Him. Whether he lived or died mattered little. What concerned this follower of Christ was to live Him and to magnify Him in his body. He wanted Christ to be expressed through him.<p>In speaking of his suffering, Paul says, &#8220;For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&#8221; (1:19, Gk.). The all-inclusive Spirit renders us the bountiful supply, while the suffering turns out to be a salvation for us. By this bountiful supply, Paul magnified Christ and lived Him out (1:20-21).<h2 class=head1>EPHESIANS</h2><p>Ephesians deals with the issue of a life which lives Christ.<h2 class=head2>God Dispensed</h2><p>This book tells us that the church is the Body of Christ and that it is the fullness of Him who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22-23). How could the church possibly be His fullness? It is by the unsearchable riches of Christ dispensed into all the members who live Christ out. The more we live Christ out, the more His riches will be dispensed into our being. In the very next verse after the unsearchable riches of Christ are mentioned, is the dispensation of the mystery (3:8-9). The mystery, therefore, is the dispensation of the Triune God: the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow.<h2 class=head2>The Outcome</h2><p>The outcome of this dispensation of the Triune God into His chosen people is the church (3:10), which is to display God&#8217;s wisdom &#8220;according to the purpose of the ages&#8221; (3:11).<p>Have you noticed the sequence in these four verses (3:8-11)? The unsearchable riches of Christ in verse 8 are the dispensation of the mystery in verse 9. The issue is the church in verse 10, which is according to God&#8217;s eternal purpose in verse 11.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Eternal Purpose Realized</h2><p>Practically speaking, God&#8217;s eternal purpose is realized by our participating in Christ&#8217;s riches. This we do by taking Christ as our life and as our person. If He is our life and our person, we can say that He lives in us and makes His home in us (3:17). We have nothing in common with religion, law, and isms. Our only concern is to take Christ as our life and our person. As we do this day after day, we enjoy all His riches. This enjoyment is the dispensation of the mystery.<h2 class=head2>Organic Relatedness</h2><p>This way of living issues in the church. The church is not a group of people with the Christian faith who come together to sing hymns. The church is a Body. My body is not just a few bones stuck together and covered with skin, then dressed in some clothing. To claim that that is my body is an insult. My body is made up of organs, which are organically interrelated. A group of Christians singing hymns together do not necessarily have any organic relatedness. Some Christians could perhaps be likened to a set of dentures, placed in the body but not part of it.<p>Is our relationship to the Body of Christ like that of a set of dentures? No! We are growing together organically, not placed together by organization. When those of different nationalities are put together, the relationship is not easy. In the church we have many different nationalities and backgrounds. Nonetheless, we can all grow together!<h2 class=head2>Nourishment for Growth</h2><p>What makes us grow? It is by getting the proper nourishment. If a little piece of flesh is taken from one part of our body and grafted onto another, within a few days the graft will become part of the flesh in the new location. Yet without nourishment that little piece could not grow together with the body. Both are organic, but they need nourishment.<p>Our nourishment is the unsearchable riches of Christ. As we live by Him and He is magnified in our body, we shall all grow together as His Body. Thus, we must learn to participate in Christ. If all we have is in the realm of knowledge, the result will be dissension. If, on the other hand, we enjoy Christ as our food and drink, His unsearchable riches will make us grow and the church will be the result.<h2 class=head2>The Church Life</h2><p>It was for this that Paul prayed in Ephesians 3. He bowed his knees unto the Father, &#8220;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&#8221; (vv. 14-19). The Father strengthens us through the Spirit that the Son may make His home in our hearts, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. This is the church.<p>If we look around us at Christians today, we can see how much attention is focused on knowledge and how little on the experiential enjoyment of the riches of Christ. This is why there is so little church life, in spite of the multitudes of Christians.<p>Some of us have been Christians for years. With whom have we been growing together? If we live Christ, the issue is the church life. If we find that we are still individualistic, it is an indication that our experience of Christ is not genuine. The experience of Christ is not for individuals, but for the corporate Body. Our enjoyment of Christ must result in the corporate church life.<h2 class=head2>Only Christ</h2><p>May we all be so clear that Christ stands against religion, philosophy, and culture. We must care only for Him. When the thought comes to us that we must be loving or pleasant, we must reject it. We must say no to all such considerations and have regard only for Christ, this all-inclusive Spirit who is in our spirit.<p>&#8220;Lord, thank You that I have been crucified with You. You are against religion, philosophy, and culture. I have nothing to do with them either, because I have been crucified with You. Now I am one spirit with You. I want to care only for You. I would keep contacting You and walking in You. I want to converse with You and be one with You all the time.&#8221;<p>If we keep praying and practicing this, our mind will be set on the spirit. The life supply will be infused into our being and become our nourishment. We shall grow and even grow together. We shall be able to say, &#8220;To me to live is Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&#8221;<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE GOOD LAND AND THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gal. 3:14; 4:6; 5:16-18, 25; 6:18; Eph. 1:13, 17; 2:18-22; 3:5, 16-17a; 4:4, 23, 30; 5:18; 6:17-18a; Phil. 1:19-20; 2:1; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 5:7; 10:4; Col. 1:12; 2:6; 3:11; Eph. 3:8</h1><p>There may be a bountiful spread on the dining table, a sampling of the riches of America. It is another matter, however, for those riches to be realized by us in our being. The same is true with regard to our enjoyment of Christ as the good land. The key to experiencing Him is to be found in the two spirits, which are mentioned in most of the verses given above.<h2 class=head1>THE BLESSING OF ABRAHAM</h2><p>Galatians 3:14 tells us, &#8220;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&#8221; The promise that God gave to Abraham, in the New Testament economy has come to us through Jesus Christ. What is this blessing that was promised to Abraham? It is the Spirit, as this verse clearly tells us.<p>But, you may ask, was it not the good land which was promised to Abraham? Yes, Abraham was surely promised the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15, 17; 15:18; 17:8). This promise was repeated to his son Isaac (Gen. 26:3) and to his grandson Jacob (28:13; 35:12). However, in Galatians 3 Paul interprets the good land as the blessing of the Spirit. The Old Testament promise was of the good land, but in the New Testament fulfillment the promise becomes the Spirit. Have you ever realized that the Spirit whom you have received is the good land?<p>&#8220;And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&#8221; (Gal. 4:6). The Spirit sent by God is the blessing promised to Abraham for his descendants. We today in Jesus Christ are by faith the descendants of Abraham and the heirs of God&#8217;s promise (3:29). We may say, then, that the good land has been sent to us! What need is there for us to go to the Holy Land for a sight-seeing tour; the good land is within us! This is where we are walking and living.<p>There is a further inference of the Spirit as the good land in Galatians 5:25: &#8220;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&#8221; The good land was the type of the all-inclusive Christ, and Christ in His resurrection became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This Spirit has been dispensed into our spirit. Here we receive life by Him, and we are to walk by Him. (See also Galatians 6:18, where we find that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with our spirit.)<h2 class=head1>THE TWO SPIRITS IN EPHESIANS 1</h2><p>Ephesians speaks further of the Spirit and our spirit. In 1:13 we are told, &#8220;You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.&#8221; Earlier in chapter one it says that God has blessed us, or spoken well of us. The Spirit&#8217;s sealing of us is the reaching stage of God&#8217;s well-speaking of us. When a paper, for example, has a seal stamped upon it, this indicates that the paper has been reached by the seal. The Triune God is rich, but God did not reach us as the Father. Nor did He ultimately reach us as the Son. Yes, the Son came to us, but He did not come into us. It was the Spirit who entered into us. The Triune God reaches us as the Spirit. The Father, Son, and Spirit all reach us in the sealing with the Spirit.<p>A seal is fixed and lasting. Now that God has reached you, He remains with you and will never leave. When a seal has been affixed to a paper, the two cannot be separated; they become one. Do you realize that the Triune God has reached you in the Spirit and made Himself one with you?<p>The seal of the Spirit is also the good land. Corporations use a seal, which may vary in size, to authenticate their documents. What is the size of our seal? It is the size of the good land. No one can take the good land away from us, because it seals us, making us one with God and Him one with us.<p>In Ephesians 1:17 Paul prays &#8220;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.&#8221; Spirit in this verse refers to the human spirit. On the one hand, the Spirit is within us, yet, on the other hand, our spirit needs to be enlightened. We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we may realize this sealing Spirit, who is the good land.<p>That you are saved I have no doubt. But, sorry to say, I do not have the confidence that you realize what you have received with your salvation. You have received the blessing promised to Abraham! This blessing is the good land; it is Christ as the Spirit, who has sealed you. For this to be real to you, you need the spirit of wisdom and revelation for which Paul prayed. Are you living in the good land? If you are, you are living in your spirit, enjoying the Spirit as the good land.<h2 class=head1>THE TWO SPIRITS IN EPHESIANS 2</h2><p>&#8220;For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father&#8221; (Eph. 2:18). Even this short verse has the Trinity. &#8220;Through Him&#8221; means through the Son; but until we add &#8220;in one Spirit,&#8221; our access is somewhat theoretical. When we are in the Spirit, we are in the presence of the Father to enjoy all the riches.<p>Verses 21 and 22 go on to tell us that in Christ &#8220;all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&#8221; How big is our spirit? It must be big enough to contain God&#8217;s habitation! When we build a meeting hall, we need to have a good-sized lot. The lot where God&#8217;s habitation is, our spirit, is universally spacious. All of us together are one lot, for God has only one habitation; we are not separate small lots.<h2 class=head1>THE TWO SPIRITS IN EPHESIANS 3</h2><p>The mystery &#8220;has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit&#8221; (3:5). The revelation came to them not in their mentality but in their spirit.<p>Paul prays that the Father &#8220;would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man&#8221; (3:16). When we listen to a message, it has the effect of strengthening our whole being into the inner man. The inner man is the regenerated spirit, where the Spirit of God dwells. During the day we may find it easy to gossip or feel discouraged, but after a meeting we have no use for gossip and the discouragement is gone. This is because our being has been brought into the inner man, where the good land, with the riches of Christ, is.<p>The result of our being thus strengthened is that Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith (3:17). When the Spirit works and our spirit, the inner man, responds, Christ settles down in our heart, becoming our enjoyment. By enjoying this settled Christ as the riches of the good land, we are &#8220;filled unto all the fullness of God&#8221; (3:19).<h2 class=head1>THE TWO SPIRITS IN EPHESIANS 4</h2><p>Ephesians 4 also refers to both the Holy Spirit and the human spirit.<p>In verse 4, where it says, &#8220;One Body and one Spirit,&#8221; the reference is to the Holy Spirit. One Body implies one habitation; one Spirit means the one Spirit in all our spirits.<p>Verse 23, &#8220;And are renewed in the spirit of your mind,&#8221; indicates that our mind is now occupied and saturated by the Spirit. The nations walk &#8220;in the vanity of their mind&#8221; (v. 17), preoccupied with worldly entertainment. Our mind, in contrast, is being renewed from the old creation to the new, so that our mind is a mind of the spirit.<p>In Ephesians 4:30 we are exhorted not to &#8220;grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in Whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.&#8221; This sealing Spirit, who is the good land to you, will not leave you, but do not grieve Him.<h2 class=head1>THE FILLED SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS 5</h2><p>&#8220;And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit&#8221; (Eph. 5:18). To be drunk is to have our body filled with wine. Rather than this, we are to have our spirit filled with God, with the riches of Christ. Our spirit must be filled!<h2 class=head1>THE TWO SPIRITS IN EPHESIANS 6</h2><p>&#8220;And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God&#8221; (Eph. 6:17). According to the Greek grammar, the word &#8220;which&#8221; in this verse refers to Spirit, not to sword. The Spirit, then, is the word of God. This corresponds with the Lord&#8217;s word in John 6:63, &#8220;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit.&#8221; There is a sense, then, in which the Word is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Word.<p>You may feel that much of what we have covered in this message about the Spirit is too abstract. When we speak of the Word, however, you have something down-to-earth which you can grasp. The Lord today is the Spirit; He is also embodied in His Word. The Lord, the Spirit, and the Word are all one. We need all three, because it is through the Word and the Spirit that the Lord is realized by us.<p>If the Lord Jesus were not the Spirit, we could not realize Him. Nor could we realize Him if we did not have a spirit. As the Spirit, He indwells and mingles with our spirit, making us both one. Yet the matter of the Spirit is mysterious.<p>It is the Word which makes these abstractions real to us. Whenever we come to the Bible with a proper spirit, reading, praying, and receiving it, this Word getting into us becomes the Spirit. What we read and receive is the Word; what comes into us is the Spirit. As long as we receive the Word into our spirit, it becomes spirit and life. If we take the Word only into our mind, however, it is merely a thought or some knowledge.<p>How can we be sure that we are receiving the Word into our spirit? The next verse, Ephesians 6:18, gives us the way: &#8220;By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit.&#8221; We must pray, but not for our affairs. Pray to receive the Word as the Spirit. Day by day, unceasingly, use the Word to pray for the Spirit. Such prayer will make the mystery real to you in your life.<h2 class=head1>THE TWO SPIRITS IN PHILIPPIANS</h2><h2 class=head2>The Spirit of Jesus Christ</h2><p>Paul told the Philippians that whatever sufferings or persecutions he underwent, &#8220;I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:19, Gk.). Notice the term that is used for the Spirit here. Paul said his afflictions would become a salvation to him by the bountiful supply of the Spirit, but not the Spirit of God, or the Spirit of Jesus, or the Spirit of Christ. It was by the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<p>Who is Jesus Christ? He is the processed God. He passed through creation, incarnation, human life, and death. He has entered into resurrection and ascension. The processed God as a term is not found in the Bible; nor is the word Trinity. But the facts are clearly stated in the Bible.<p>What is the bountiful supply of this Spirit? It is the realization of the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8). The riches are objective, but they are experienced subjectively as this supply. It was because of this Spirit&#8217;s supplying, supporting, and sustaining him that Paul could say, &#8220;Christ shall be magnified in my body&#8221; (Phil. 1:20).<h2 class=head2>Fellowship in Spirit</h2><p>Besides the bountiful supply of the Spirit, there is also the need for the fellowship in spirit (Phil. 2:1, Gk.). Our spirit is necessary for taking in the supply God has made available. The Spirit supplies the food, and our spirit supplies the mouth and the stomach! Day by day we exercise our spirit to fellowship with Him and with one another. Such vertical and horizontal fellowship is the eating. In my speaking I am eating; in your listening you are eating. When the meeting is over, we all feel full. This is the fellowship, the enjoyment of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE WORD IN COLOSSIANS</h2><p>In Colossians the stress is not on the Spirit but on the Word. Colossians 3:16 says, &#8220;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&#8221; The parallel verse in Ephesians 5:18 says, &#8220;Be filled in spirit.&#8221; One says the word; the other, the spirit. The result of both is the same: singing, speaking, and praising the Lord. The word of Christ in Colossians 3:16 is the Spirit. Letting the Word dwell in us richly equals letting the Spirit fill us.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICAL ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p>How are we to experience this Christ, the One who as the Spirit is the rich land to us? How does He bountifully supply us? The key is found in the two spirits, which are one (1 Cor. 6:17). In our spirit is this very One who Himself has become the Spirit.<p>Stay in this mingled spirit. Return whenever you find you are away.<p>How can you remain in, or return to, this mingled spirit? It is by praying and by reading the Word. Do not allow yourself to be distracted by your circumstances. All other things are contrary to Christ. Christ is contrary to all other things. Pray to contact Him. Pray by reading the Word. These two things will keep you in the spirit. Then you will taste and experience Christ. He will be whatever you need, whether it is light, strength, wisdom, or victory. Do not seek these things themselves. Seek the living Person.<p>This will give the Lord the opportunity to fulfill His word, &#8220;I will build My church&#8221; (Matt. 16:18). This building is accomplished by the believers remaining in the mingled spirit. Then the Body of Christ can be built up. In the mingled spirit is the mystery of God and of Christ. Here are His riches and the Spirit&#8217;s bountiful supply. Here is the good land where we should walk.<h2 class=head1>THE CORINTHIAN ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p>There are two passages in 1 Corinthians that indicate that the church in Corinth was only in the initial stage of the enjoyment of Christ. &#8220;Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us....And did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ&#8221; (5:7; 10:4).<p>The children of Israel were in Egypt when they enjoyed the Passover lamb, and in the wilderness when their thirst was quenched by the living water that flowed out of the rock that followed them. To enjoy Christ as the Passover pertains to salvation and the exodus from the world. Christ as the rock supplying living water is for the beginning period of the Christian life.<p>The church in Corinth was in this elementary stage. It was characterized by worldliness and wanderings in the soul. Thus their enjoyment of Christ was not mature.<h2 class=head1>THE MATURE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</h2><p>When we come to the writings of Paul to the Colossians and Ephesians, however, we find that their enjoyment of Christ was as the good land. This is the mature stage.<p>Colossians 1:12 says, &#8220;Giving thanks to the Father, Who qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.&#8221; What the Apostle Paul had in mind here was the good land, which was allotted to the twelve tribes of Israel when they entered it. Our portion means the part of the good land allotted to us.<p>Christ in Colossians is no longer merely the Passover or the manna, but rather the final portion of God&#8217;s chosen people, that is, the good land. Colossians 2:6 bears this out: &#8220;As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&#8221; We could not walk in the Passover lamb or in the manna, but Christ as the good land is spacious and rich. Our lot is a rich land that produces many Passover lambs and many grains, as well as oil and wine.<p>Christ in this book is &#8220;all and in all&#8221; (3:11). Such a description does not fit the Passover lamb nor the manna; only the good land can be described in such an inclusive way.<p>The same is true of &#8220;the unsearchable riches of Christ,&#8221; a term found in the book of Ephesians (3:8). The Passover lamb and the manna cannot be considered as unsearchably rich. Christ&#8217;s unsearchable riches are surely the rich produce of the good land.<h2 class=head1>PRESSING ON</h2><p>Would you say that the churches today are in Corinthians? Are we enjoying Christ as the Passover, yet still in Egypt? Or we may have made our exodus from Egypt and are now in the wilderness, receiving revelation, building the tabernacle, and feasting on manna. Surely it is good to have the tabernacle as God&#8217;s building, yet the tabernacle lacked solidity; it was portable with no foundation. There was no stone, only wood, in its construction. The wilderness had no supply for building the temple. Neither manna nor the living water could be used for building material. Only in the good land were there materials suitable for the temple&#8217;s construction. Are we wandering in the wilderness of the soul, enjoying manna from heaven and water from the rock, and carrying a floating church life with no solid foundation?<p>Or, are the churches today in Colossians and Ephesians? Are we walking about in a spacious land, full of unsearchable riches? Is the church life built up, as solid as the temple?<p>We hesitate to evaluate the churches from this standpoint, but at least we may say that we are on the way to the good land and are not satisfied to remain in the tabernacle church life. Within us there is a hunger and thirst for something higher in the church life than we have yet experienced. The dissatisfaction which we sense is really not ours but the Lord&#8217;s. He within us is aspiring to have the temple church life in the good land. He would have us out of Corinth and into Ephesus! out of the wilderness and into the good land! out of the soul and into the spirit!<p>During this interim stage, let us go on. We are well able to enter the good land and possess it! Our way is by means of the ark with the tabernacle. Without the ark and the tabernacle the children of Israel could not have succeeded in entering the good land. You remember that before they crossed the Jordan River, the ark preceded them and stayed in the river bed until all of them had crossed over (Josh. 3:14-17). By virtue of the ark and the tabernacle, they entered the good land.<p>In one way we are happy to be in the church life; in another, we long for something richer. We must go on by virtue of what we have. We do have the ark in the tabernacle church life. By this we can enter a higher level, the good land, where the temple can be built up. May we together press on toward this.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>TWO LIVES GRAFTED INTO ONE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 6:5, 8; 7:4; 9:21, 23-24; 11:17, 24; 12:5</h1><h2 class=head1>THE CREATOR AND THE CREATURE</h2><p>The relationship between God and man is a mystery. The common concept is that God is the Creator and man is the creature. God is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. He has created all things. Therefore, man as a small, finite being must worship, revere, and fear Him. Since He is all-powerful and human beings are weak and frail, man must trust and depend on Him. Whenever man is in trials and sufferings, he calls on the heavens for help. This reaching after God is inherent in man. This view of man&#8217;s relation to God may be scriptural, but it is superficial.<h2 class=head1>A DEEPER RELATIONSHIP</h2><p>What the Bible reveals as the ultimate relationship between God and us is far deeper than that of Creator and creature. The nature of this relationship is beyond human concept. It is that God and we may have a union in life. The divine life and the human life join together to become one life.<p>There is a picture of this in nature. I believe we are all aware that the physical things in the world are signs of spiritual realities. The Lord Jesus again and again used common things as illustrations of spiritual matters.<p>In the plant kingdom a branch which is not doing very well may be cut off the parent tree and attached to a healthier, more productive tree. This procedure, known as grafting, illustrates the union between God and us. A. B. Simpson&#8217;s hymn, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ,&#8221; refers to this in the third stanza:<p class=hbody>This the secret nature hideth,<br>Harvest grows from buried grain;<br>A poor tree with better grafted,<br>Richer, sweeter life doth gain.</p><p class=hbody>Hymns, #482</p><h2 class=head1>ILLUSTRATIONS FROM ROMANS</h2><h2 class=head2>Grafting</h2><p>The thought expressed in this verse comes from Romans 11. &#8220;You, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in...and became a fellow-partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree....You were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree...&#8221; (vv. 17, 24). We were the poor, small, wild olive branches, grafted into the cultivated, superior olive tree, and are now enjoying the rich nourishment from the root.<p>The branch that is grafted is not identical to the tree to which it is attached. If they were identical, there would be no need of grafting. It is a branch from a problem tree which is grafted to a tree having some superior quality. The consequence is that the good tree subdues the inferior branch.<p>Such is the real nature of the Christian life. The Lord Jesus as the true vine is the superior tree. One day by faith through grace you were grafted into Him. Do not despise this grafting. It means that you no longer have just one life. Your life is now from two lives that have been grafted into one. As you enjoy the root of the fatness of this cultivated olive tree, your poorer life is subdued, and you begin to flourish.<p>This is the relationship the Bible reveals between God and us. It must extend beyond that of Creator and creature until it reaches a union in life.<h2 class=head2>Marriage</h2><p>Grafting is one picture of this union between God and us. Another illustration is given in Romans 7, where we are considered a wife and the Lord Jesus the husband. &#8220;So that, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you might marry another, even Him Who has been raised from among the dead, that we might bear fruit to God&#8221; (v. 4). As the wife, we had a former husband, our old man. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, our old husband was crucified with Him, thus making us a widow. Shortly thereafter, however, we remarried, this time to the Lord Jesus!<p>Let us consider further the matter of marriage as an example of our relationship with Christ. The first marriage was between Adam and Eve. Adam, you will remember, was created by God from the dust of the ground. Then God breathed into him the breath of life, and he became a living soul (see Gen. 2:7). Eve, however, came into existence differently. God caused Adam to fall asleep, then took a rib out of his side and built a woman (Gen. 2:21-22). Adam and this woman became one. Their union was a union in life. Eve came out of Adam, and so did her life. Both of them shared one life.<p>The New Testament applies this example to Christ and the church (Eph. 5:31-32). We came out of Christ; His life becomes our life, and we and He become one. This again is a union in life.<h2 class=head2>Container and Content</h2><p>In Romans 9 Paul likens us to vessels formed by God (vv. 21, 23). These vessels are to have God Himself as their content, thus making them vessels to honor, full of riches and glory. God is our inward content; we are His outward expression. The content and the container are one; here again is a union.<h2 class=head2>Head and Body</h2><p>A further illustration is given in Romans 12, where we are depicted as the Body of Christ (v. 5). We are united to Him, just as the body and the head are one entity.<h2 class=head1>THE GRAFTED BRANCH RETAINING ITS OWN LIFE</h2><p>Notice that this grafted life, pictured for us in these different ways, is not an exchanged life. The inferior branch has not given up its poor life in order to get the richer life of the tree to which it is grafted. No! The branch still retains its same essential characteristics, but its life is uplifted and transformed by being grafted to the better life.<p>What are the results of the grafting? When the fatness of the better tree supplies the grafted branch, all the negative things are taken away. Then the original function of that branch is restored and strengthened. The fruit is still what it was before the grafting, but the problem factors have been overcome. We are the problem branches that God has grafted to Christ. The fatness of His life comes into us, carrying away all the poor elements in us. He uplifts the original function God had for us, strengthening and enriching it. Then naturally and spontaneously our whole being is saturated and transformed, and a marvelous fruit comes forth.<p>I have been concerned to share with the saints this matter of the grafted life, because it has been of great help to me. For many years I groped and searched for the way to experience what the Bible tells us. We followed others to teach that we must exchange our poor life for the good life of the Lord Jesus. We also tried to practice reckoning as the way to be free from sinning. We taught that since we are prone to sin, we have to see that we are already dead and then reckon on that fact. The result of reckoning was discouragement. Before we tried to reckon, we were dormant. But once we started to reckon, not only did we find that we were not dead; we were more alive than before.<p>Only gradually did we come to see that Romans is not talking about an exchanged life or a reckoning method. This grafted life means that whatever lack we have, as long as we are grafted into the precious tree of the Lord Jesus, His excellent life will come into us.<h2 class=head1>THE TIME OF THE GRAFTING</h2><p>When did this grafting occur? It was at the time we believed and were baptized. Romans 6:3 says, &#8220;Or are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?&#8221; When we were baptized, we were baptized into the Lord Jesus in spirit and were identified with Him. The life within Him came into us.<h2 class=head1>GROWING TOGETHER WITH HIM</h2><p>Romans 6:5 goes on to say, &#8220;For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.&#8221;<p>The words &#8220;have grown together with Him&#8221; in the Greek imply an organic union. The meaning is quite rich. It can be likened to a skin graft. The surgeon may cut a piece of flesh from a patient&#8217;s leg and attach it to his arm. After a few days the skin taken from the leg will grow together with the flesh of the arm; they will be organically joined to each other. Life growth will occur.<p>This is the very kind of union meant in Romans 6:5. We have been grafted to the Lord Jesus and are now supplied by His life and His riches. A growth is taking place as we are enjoying Him. This union is not like two dead pieces of wood put together; however closely they may be placed to each other, there is no growing together. There must be a living branch grafted into a living tree for there to be not only a joining but also an organic growing together, with the branch enjoying the riches of the life of the better tree.<p>The Chinese version translates &#8220;grown together with Him&#8221; as &#8220;identified with Him.&#8221; This is quite good, but we do need to include the thought of being joined and growing together with Him. Both the joining and the growth are essential for a successful graft. If the two pieces of flesh do not grow together after a graft, within a few days the grafted skin will decay. The joining together must bring the growth; then the two lives become one.<h2 class=head1>THE CUTTING</h2><p>When a branch is grafted, both it and the tree must be cut. Just binding them together will not join them organically. Both must be cut and then grafted together at the site of the cut. When the two wounds kiss each other, the graft can take and there will be the growth.<p>When was the Lord Jesus cut? It was on the cross. The wound of the Lord Jesus is waiting for sinners. His side has been pierced, the blood shed.<p>When is the sinner cut? He too has been cut on the cross. He experiences this cutting when he repents and receives the Lord.<p>We had a co-worker from the northeast of China who, before his conversion, was arrogantly opposed to Christianity. One day he went into a temple and noticed an open Bible on the table in front of the idols. His curiosity was aroused, and he began to read Psalm 1. Its words quite impressed him, and he decided to take the Bible home and read it. He did so. The more he read, the more the light shined. Convicted of his sins, he wept, beat his breast, and rolled on the floor in repentance.<p>Was this repentance not a cutting? He was a branch being cut. Then when he called on the Lord to save him, he was grafted to this One who had already been cut. At the site where the wound of the sinner met the wound of the Lord Jesus, they were grafted together. The Lord began to live and grow in this newly grafted branch to supply him.<h2 class=head1>GRAFTING AND GROWING</h2><p>When Paul says, &#8220;We have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death,&#8221; he is saying that in the place where we were cut, we were grafted into the Lord. This grafting is the growing. We are not first grafted and then begin to grow. Rather, we have been grafted into Him in the likeness of His death and have grown together with Him all at the same time.<h2 class=head1>IN DEATH AND IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>Notice the two aspects of grafting and growing together in Romans 6:5: &#8220;For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.&#8221; The first aspect is in the likeness of His death and refers to our being grafted into Him. The second is in the likeness of His resurrection and refers to His coming into us to grow in us. This second aspect is resurrection.<p>The initial grafting is related to the Lord&#8217;s death. He is the true vine. When He was crucified, He was thoroughly cut. Now His cut wound is waiting for the repentant sinners, and He as the life-giving Spirit moves in us, searching our inner being, enlightening us so that we repent. Our grief and tears are the cut we receive. We have no choice but to believe in the Lord and ask Him to save us. &#8220;O Lord, thank You that You died for me. Thank You for shedding Your blood for me. Thank You, Lord, for saving me.&#8221; This is the time when we are grafted into Him and grow together with Him in the likeness of His death.<p>Once we are thus grafted into Him, His resurrection life comes into us and removes all the negative elements within. His life becomes ours in resurrection. He uplifts the original functions given us at creation, and enriches, strengthens, and even saturates our whole being. This new life is a life of two lives grafted into one. In this union are victory, life, light, power, and all the other divine attributes. All these are ours, not by an exchange, not by reckoning, but by being grafted into Him.<p>This concept of the divine life and the human life being grafted into one is foreign to human thought. Because of this, when we come to read the Bible, we miss it. I trust that now we have all been deeply impressed that as saved ones, the life we live is that of two lives grafted into one. By the Lord&#8217;s grace we have repented, and through repentance and believing we have been grafted into the divine life. In this grafting we grow together with Him. Then in resurrection His life grows in us. The divine life is in us, supplying us. This is the Christian life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>TWO SPIRITS JOINED AS ONE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26a; 2:7; Zech. 12:1b; John 3:6; 7:39; 14:17; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22a; Rom. 8:2, 16, 4; 1 Thes. 5:17,19; Eph. 6:18</h1><h2 class=head1>LIMITED BY OUR NATURAL CONCEPTS</h2><p>When we read the Bible, it is easy for us to understand and even experience those things which fit our natural concept. If, for example, we read about how our environment perfects us, how tribulations make us patient, we can easily accept such a thought and apply it in our living.<p>It is another matter, however, when we come to the matter of God and man being organically mingled, as in grafting. We may feel we understand that we need to live such a grafted life, but when it actually comes down to our everyday experience, the truth is that we have not touched even the border of such a life.<p>In a recent meeting when the saints were sharing their experiences, I noticed that one after another testified that tribulation pressed them to experience the Lord. Some felt persecuted at home; others, at work. As I listened, I thought how easy it is to know tribulation, but how hard to know life. Yes, tribulation forces us to contact the Lord, but what is the result of contacting the Lord?<p>You may protest that it was I who taught you to accept your circumstances as the arrangement of the Lord. It is true that I preached a good number of messages telling you that all things work together for good, according to Romans 8:28. However, since 1961 I have been preaching mainly about the Spirit. How much of this have you taken in? The persecution of the environment we can easily comprehend, but the matter of the Spirit eludes us.<p>Consider our previous message on the grafted life. You may have been impressed while you were reading it, but before too long, you began to consider in your mind. You remembered learning that in grafting the better branch is grafted to an inferior tree. Why did the message say that the poorer branch is grafted to a good tree? All your inspiration about the Lord and you being grafted into one life fades away, and your mind continues its thoughts: Romans 11 is talking about the nations being grafted to the nation of Israel; it is not about our being grafted to the Lord Jesus. By all this activity in your mind, the message is made void.<p>What Romans 11 says is that the wild olive branch has been grafted to the good olive tree, and that its root is supporting the wild branch. The Bible is contrary to your thought. The good branch is not the Lord Jesus grafted into the inferior tree. In that case, we would be upholding Him, instead of His upholding us. The thought is that we as the inferior branches are grafted into Him. He is the true vine, but we as the branches have not grown naturally on His vine. We have been grafted into it.<p>Romans 11 primarily refers to the natural Israel. However, Christ is joined to Israel, and He is the true Israel (see Isa. 49:1-4). All Israelites can become the real Israel by being grafted into Him. Hence, this olive tree in Romans 11 may also refer to Christ. All true believers among both Jews and Gentiles are grafted to this olive tree, so that it includes Christ and all His believers.<h2 class=head1>&#8220;INTO...&#8221;</h2><p>In John 3:36 we are told: &#8220;He who believes in the Son has eternal life.&#8221; The word &#8220;in&#8221; here is literally &#8220;into.&#8221; We believe into the Son. The same Greek preposition is used in Romans 6:3: &#8220;...Baptized into Christ Jesus.&#8221; We were put into the Lord Jesus, just as we were put into the water at baptism. The step of being baptized into Him takes the one foot of believing and the other foot of being baptized. We believe into Him and are baptized into Him.<p>What does baptism mean? It does not refer to life, but rather death. &#8220;As many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death&#8221; (Rom. 6:3). The death of the Lord Jesus left Him with a wound. At the site of this wound we are baptized into Him, are grafted into Him, and grow together with Him. By being baptized into His death, we are grafted into Him. This grafting is a union and a growth. The joining activates the growth process. The life juice of the tree gets into the grafted branch, and it begins to grow in resurrection.<h2 class=head1>THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN GOD AND MAN</h2><p>For two trees to be grafted, there must be a close similarity between them. A banana tree cannot be grafted to a grape vine. The same is true with a skin graft. If the skin to be used in a graft is foreign to the body, the body will reject it.<p>How then can our human life be grafted to God&#8217;s life? It is because the two lives are to some extent similar. Man was made in God&#8217;s image and according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26). But, you may ask, how can God have an image when He does not have any form? Idols are images because they have a form, but what is God&#8217;s image?<p>Some explain image as meaning the inner attributes, with the term likeness denoting the outward form. However, I would explain image as referring to one&#8217;s expression, while likeness refers to one&#8217;s stance. If I stand with my hand raised in a salute, my image is my expression, but my likeness is that of a soldier! If I jump and leap on the platform, my image is still my expression, but my likeness is that of a hart!<p>When God created man in the beginning, He created man with His image, or expression, or face. Then He also made man according to His likeness, that is, according to His stature; for this He used the dust of the ground.<p>You may ask how God could have a physical form. This is a difficult question. There is, however, an instance of God&#8217;s appearing in the form of a body before the Lord&#8217;s coming to earth in the incarnation. In Genesis 18 Abraham was sitting at the door of his tent one hot summer day, when three men approached. Two were apparently angels (cf. Gen. 18:22), but one was clearly Jehovah the Lord (18:13). He came as a real person. He ate the meal Abraham prepared for Him, after having His feet washed. He talked with Abraham in an ordinary way, not like the Creator issuing decrees from a heavenly throne. As He was going on His way, Abraham accompanied Him a little distance. This closeness constrained God to open to him and reveal what He would do, as one would share with a friend. Is this God in Genesis 18 a man? Who is this Jehovah? He is surely the same as the Lord Jesus in the New Testament. This is beyond theology&#8217;s ability to explain, but we can see from this passage that man has a body after God&#8217;s likeness.<p>At the time of creation, God breathed into man&#8217;s nostrils the breath of life (Gen. 2:7). The Hebrew word translated breath in this verse is translated spirit in Proverbs 20:27: &#8220;The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all the inward parts of the belly&#8221; (Heb.). The breath of life in Genesis 2 becomes the spirit of man in Proverbs 20. The human spirit is the breath of life from God that enters into man and becomes his spirit.<p>The spirit may well be what Confucius was referring to when he said that there is a bright virtue within man. His thought was that this bright virtue needed to be developed and further brightened. The Bible, however, shows us that this spirit needs to be regenerated. In our spirit, which was formed from God&#8217;s breathing into man the breath of life, there is not the Spirit of God. Therefore, the spirit must receive another life by being &#8220;born of the Spirit&#8221; of God (John 3:6).<p>The spirit of man is his most precious part. It is what distinguishes him from animals. Once this breath of life got into man&#8217;s nostrils, he became a living soul, with a personality that in reality is in the image of God. Man&#8217;s emotions, desires, and intelligence correspond with God&#8217;s. God has such feelings as love; He has desires; and He has thoughts, wisdom, and intelligence. In a sense we are like a photograph of God. The photograph is not God Himself, but it is His image.<p>It is foolish to accept Darwin&#8217;s theory that man evolved from lower animals. All the plant and animal life created by God in Genesis 1 were designed to reproduce after their kind (vv. 11, 12, 21, 24, 25). But when it came to the creation of man, instead of saying &#8220;after his kind,&#8221; it says &#8220;after our likeness&#8221; (v. 26). Man is not in the category of animals. He is a picture of God. God created man like Himself.<p>We are not God, anymore than a picture of the President is the President. But we must not demean ourselves. If we see that we are God&#8217;s image, we shall realize that we are vessels of honor prepared unto glory.<h2 class=head1>MAN CREATED TO BE JOINED TO GOD</h2><p>Why did God make us so similar to Himself? It was so that one day man might be grafted into God.<p>In Zechariah 12:1 the Lord is described as the One who &#8220;stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.&#8221; Notice how the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man are put together as the three important things in the universe. The heavens are for the earth: without sunshine, water, and air, all of which come from the heavens, the living things on the earth could not exist. The earth is for man: without the provisions that come from the earth, man could not exist. What is man for? Man is for God. When Zechariah refers here to the creation of man, he does not mention the body, but rather the spirit. To have man, God first stretched forth the heavens, then laid the foundation of the earth; then He formed &#8220;the spirit of man within him.&#8221; When all the physical things in the universe were ready and could provide man with a suitable environment, God put man on the scene. He formed the spirit of man to be a container for Himself. Our spirit is the organ by which we contact God.<p>Notice this series: the heavens, the earth, the spirit of man. In the whole universe these are the three most important matters. Treasure your spirit! It is as significant as the heavens and the earth. Zechariah could have enumerated countless other items created by God, but only these three are listed together, because these are directly related to God. All these were created so that God might obtain a group of people to express Him.<p>We are vessels of honor and glory because we contain God. A diamond ring is usually kept in an attractive velvet box. Because the ring is so precious, it needs a beautiful container. The box is honorable and glorious because of the diamond ring it contains. We in ourselves may be only a box, but within us is God Himself. Do you realize what a treasure you have in this earthen vessel? Does it not excite you to have such a precious diamond in your possession? The value of this diamond cannot be measured in carats. No scale can weigh it. It is limitless and immeasurable. God Himself is your marvelous, glorious content!<p>Within this man, who was created in the image of God, is a receiver, like a radio; this is his spirit. Once this receiver is turned on, God comes in. Man is not only close to God, but similar to Him as well.<h2 class=head1>GOD PROCESSED TO BE JOINED TO MAN</h2><p>Although man from his creation was designed to receive God, God at that time was not ready to be received into man. Not until some four thousand years later did God initiate the process by which He could be joined to man. Do not think that four thousand years is a long time. In God&#8217;s eyes it is like four days (cf. Psa. 90:4).<p>God came in human form, not in a majestic way but in a humble way. He passed through the womb of Mary and through the manger. He escaped to Egypt. Then He went to Galilee, where He grew up in a carpenter&#8217;s home in the village of Nazareth. He spent thirty years there, working as a carpenter, known to those around Him as Jesus. Yet this One, the Child born to us, also has as His name &#8220;The mighty God&#8221; (Isa. 9:6).<p>Then He came forth to minister for three and a half years. He was persecuted and rejected by His own people. Finally the time drew near, and He talked to His disciples, explaining to them that He would be going to the cross, where He would pass through death. By this means He would not only redeem them; He would also change His form. No longer would He be restricted by His physical body from entering into them. No longer would they be in one place and He in another. No longer would He be only with them; He would actually be in them. After His death and resurrection, He as the last Adam would become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b).<p>&#8220;The Spirit,&#8221; John tells us in 7:39, &#8220;was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&#8221; This term, the Spirit, is significant. The Spirit of God is mentioned numerous times in the Old Testament, yet &#8220;the Spirit was not yet.&#8221; When the Lord Jesus emerged from death and was resurrected, He was glorified. Not until this happened was there &#8220;the Spirit.&#8221;<p>The Spirit of God is like a glass of plain water. When we add various ingredients to it, like tea and honey, it becomes a refreshing drink. Before these are added, the water is there, but the drink &#8220;is not yet.&#8221; What are the ingredients added to the Spirit of God? Before the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection, there was only God in the Spirit of God. But through the incarnation the Lord Jesus put on humanity. In resurrection this humanity was brought into the Spirit. His death was also an element that was added to the Spirit of God. This death was precious and lovable, not like the death of the first Adam. It encompasses redemption; the termination of the past; the dealing with the self, with the old man, and with all the other negative things. There is salt in this drink also, added not only for improving the flavor, but also to kill germs. Besides death, in the Spirit are found also resurrection, ascension, glorification, enthronement, dominion, and power.<p>In essence the Spirit is the Triune God-Father, Son and Spirit-as the all-inclusive Spirit. This is the ultimate expression of the Triune God.<p>With this understanding of the Spirit, verses like those in Romans 8 about the Spirit should be clear to you. Whenever you come across this term, the Spirit, in your reading of the New Testament, remember that it refers to the Triune God, passing through a long process and thus becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head1>GOD AND MAN JOINED</h2><p>Man is ready, because of his having been created with a spirit, to be joined to God. God, now that He has been through the process we have described, is ready to be joined to man. Romans 10:8 tells us that He is as near as our mouth. He is like the air; we simply breathe, and the air comes into us.<p>As soon as you confess that you need Him, He will come in. You may say only, &#8220;O Lord,&#8221; very softly, and you will breathe Him in. Many can testify that something happened inside when they said &#8220;O Lord.&#8221;<p>This is how the two spirits are joined and the two lives grafted into one. &#8220;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:17).<p>This matter of the mingled spirit Christians do not grasp. In 1961 I was preaching this right here in Taipei; even some of the hymns we sang tonight were written at that time. Yet now, eighteen years later, I listen to your testimonies and hear nothing about these two spirits becoming one. Your testimonies still concern how you are pressed by your environment. What is the reason for your trying circumstances? We must be broken, you say. No! God does not want you whole or broken. He does not want you. What He is after is this Spirit. He wants the Spirit. He wants the Spirit to be lived out from you.<h2 class=head1>VIRTUES SUBSTITUTED FOR CHRIST</h2><p>Why do we neglect this clear truth in the Bible, and instead focus our attention on humility, for example? We read some passages in the Bible, and then begin to walk with our shoulders stooped over. This meekness is short-lived. If we are deprived of our sleep, that will be the end of our meekness! It is like a monkey taught to eat in the Western way. Many years ago I saw a monkey in the zoo being trained to eat a meal with a knife and fork. After the trainer finished the lesson, the monkey tossed away the knife and fork, and resumed eating in monkey fashion. So it is with our humility; the most it can last is a day or two.<p>When the sisters read Ephesians, they come across the term &#8220;in Christ&#8221; again and again. Nothing gets through to them, however, till they come to Ephesians 5, &#8220;Husbands, love your wives&#8221; (v. 25). Then they begin to consider whether their husbands love them and whether the elders really love their wives. After applying the Scriptures to others, they turn back to apply it to themselves. &#8220;Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord&#8221; (v. 22). They remember how many times they have made up their minds to submit and have failed. They repent, with tears, and confess to the Lord that they cannot make it. They reread Ephesians, then again try and fail to submit to their husbands. Finally, they have a talk with the elders and tell them that the Bible does not work.<p>We do not notice that in the very same chapter of Ephesians it says, &#8220;Be filled in spirit&#8221; (5:18). We know Romans 8:28 about all things working together for good, but Romans 8:4, about walking according to spirit, we cannot quite grasp.<p>How much of our day are we living Christ? Even in the recovery there are probably very few of us who live Christ at all. Those who do are living Him for only a small portion of their day. The rest of us live in our flesh. We may, or may not, lose our temper, but we are not living Christ. There are Chinese philosophers, like Wang Yang-Ming, whose standard of morality exceeds that of most Christians. But even if we can come up to his standard, God is not interested. God wants the Spirit, not our good conduct.<p>He has created us in His own image and likeness, not in the image of the virtues. We are not only His picture. When He comes into us, we are part of Him, grafted into Him, having His life, and being one spirit with Him. He has no need of our virtues.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST REPLACING THE SUBSTITUTES</h2><p>Do not draw a wrong conclusion when I say that God does not want our virtues. In previous messages I have said that God does not want our culture. This is not to say that we must begin to act like barbarians. The point is that our culture or our virtues are substitutes for Christ. Once we have Him, we no longer need those substitutes. But if society had no culture, how could it be maintained? How could family life hold together? Our children must be raised according to cultural standards; they have not grown sufficiently to experience Christ. Meantime they must be kept in the sheepfold of the law until Christ comes (see John 10; Gal. 3:24-25).<p>For us who are older, Christ has come. Why should we ride in a horse-drawn cart when we can take a 747 jet to our destination? There is no longer any reason for us to remain in the fold. We have no need of the substitutes. We can live directly in the Spirit. Such living is different from the law, from culture, from ethics, and from morality. Before we have the Spirit, we need culture and morality; we need the rules and regulations of society. But what God wants is that we live out the Spirit.<p>When we live out the Spirit, the result will exceed the law and the ethical virtues. It surpasses the bright virtue mentioned by Confucius. This Spirit is God Himself.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TRIUNE GOD SATURATING THE TRIPARTITE MAN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:2a, 9-10, 6b, 11</h1><h2 class=head1>SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2><p>The relationship between God and man, as we have seen in the two previous messages, is a matter of life and of the spirit. Both life and the spirit are mysterious. Actually, according to the New Testament revelation, these two are one. In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said that the words He spoke &#8220;are spirit and are life.&#8221; The spirit is life, and life is the spirit.<p>Our human life and our human spirit are closely related. When man was formed, God &#8220;breathed into his nostrils the breath of life&#8221; (Gen. 2:7). The word breath here is the same as the word for spirit. In both Hebrew and Greek, the word spirit may mean spirit, breath, or wind. In fact, in Ezekiel 37 the one Hebrew word is translated Spirit in verse 1 and wind and breath in verse 9. Spirit, breath, and wind refer to three aspects. When the wind is weakened, it is the breath, and then becomes the spirit. We do not enjoy the strong wind of a typhoon; we prefer the gentle breeze, which is the breath. It is our breath which keeps us alive; when our breathing stops, our life is over.<p>In Romans 8:2 the words spirit and life are brought together: &#8220;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&#8221; Life and spirit are one. The term, Spirit of life, indicates that the Spirit is the source, while life is the current or flow that comes from the Spirit. Life is of the Spirit and issues from the Spirit. The Spirit is the substance and the source of life. When we refer to the electric current, we are talking about the electricity. It is electricity when it is constant; it is an electric current when it is moving. Similarly, when the Spirit is activated, it becomes life; without movement it is the Spirit. Apart from an electric current, there is no electricity. The movement of the electricity is the current; the current is the very electricity itself.<p>Apart from the Spirit, there is no other life. When did the Spirit become activated and come into you as life? It was when you confessed your sins, repented, and received the Lord Jesus. It was then that you were grafted to the Lord, and His Spirit flowed into you. Within you He should be flowing all the time, as life to you.<h2 class=head1>ACTIVATING THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Electricity has been installed in this building, but if you do not turn on the switch, the function of the electricity will not be manifested. If you want the heat, or the air-conditioning, or the lights, you must activate the electricity by turning on the switch. Then it will be hot, or cold, or bright. With too many Christians today, the Spirit within is not activated.<p>Is the Spirit within you activated? It may be moving when you are in a meeting, but how about when you are at dinner with your family? How about when you are chatting with your friends? How about when you are criticizing your daughter-in-law or your mother-in-law? How about when you are gossiping? How about when you are exchanging words with your spouse?<p>How much of the day is the Spirit in you switched on? You may love the Lord and seek Him, you may pay a price to follow Him, and you may even serve Him full time. But the question still remains, How much of your time is the Spirit turned on? If we turn off the switch in the building, what is the use of talking about how dark it is in the room?<p>You have asked me to have meetings with you about how to govern the church or how to serve the Lord. Whenever I hear a question about &#8220;how to,&#8221; my head whirls! Why? If you do not turn on the switch, what is the sense of studying how to make the lights shine or how to cool the building? If you do not know how to touch the Spirit, it is a waste of time to talk about how to be an elder. The great problem throughout the whole world today is the energy source. If this problem is not solved, it is useless to work on problems in transportation or industry. Without sufficient energy, the other problems cannot be dealt with. As soon as you find the energy source, you will have light, heat, or air-conditioning.<p>When I heard that there was a young people&#8217;s meeting arranged for me to speak at, I told the brothers, &#8220;No, let old and young both come.&#8221; I have only one subject to talk about, whether to the young or the old: touch the Spirit! If you are an unbeliever, I tell you, once you touch the Spirit by repenting, confessing, and asking the Lord to save you, you are saved. If you have had fifty years of spiritual history, I tell you, touch the Spirit! If you are weary of turning on the switch and do not want to do it any more, you will be in darkness. Every day you must turn on the switch. If you stop, you are about to die.<h2 class=head1>THE SCRIPTURES VERSUS LIFE</h2><p>Your need is to turn on the switch, not study. &#8220;You search the Scriptures,&#8221; the Lord Jesus told the religious Jews, &#8220;and you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life&#8221; (John 5:39-40). They spent time studying and searching the Scriptures from Genesis to Malachi, but they would not come to the One who could give them life. You may study the books on electricity, but if you do not want to turn on the switch, what is the use?<p>I have no understanding of how electricity works, but I turn on the switch, and the lights go on at once. I enjoy the brightness so much that I do not want to turn the lights off. Let them keep shining! I can also turn on the switch and get air-conditioning in the summer and heat when the temperature is cold. Heat, cooling, and lights all depend on my using the switch.<p>If you study the Bible every day without touching the switch, what is the use? Your spirit must touch the Lord the Spirit. These two spirits must mingle as one. The Triune God has passed through a long process to become the life-giving Spirit dwelling in your spirit. Do you really believe 1 Corinthians 6:17, &#8220;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit&#8221;? I know you believe John 3:16. You must also believe 1 Corinthians 6:17! If you are one spirit with the Lord, you have the switch. Open your spirit. Do not exercise your mind. Whether you are young or old, sister or brother-whoever you are, if you turn on the switch, you enjoy the light. If the switch is off, you may be an elder or a worker and be in darkness and death.<p>The Spirit within us needs to be activated. Then it becomes life. We have already seen in the previous messages that our life is the life that results from two lives grafted into one, and that our spirit is the spirit that issues from two spirits mingled as one. In this message we want to consider how this spirit moves and acts.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD IN ROMANS 8</h2><p>The Spirit that we are referring to is the Spirit; that is, it is the Triune God who has been processed and become the life-giving Spirit. This Triune God, as our title says, saturates the tripartite man. Look at Romans 8:9, and you will see the reference to the Triune God. &#8220;But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any one has not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&#8221; Notice that God, Christ, and the Spirit are all mentioned here. Yet this verse is not making a doctrinal statement; it is dealing with our experience. Contrary to the way Christianity presents it, the Trinity is not a doctrine for us to subscribe to. We need God to be triune in order that we may experience Him. God, Christ, and the Spirit are all in our experience.<h2 class=head2>Erroneous Concepts of the Trinity</h2><p>The traditional explanation of the Trinity is grossly inadequate and borders on tritheism. When the Spirit of God is joined with us, God is not left behind, nor does Christ remain on the throne. This is the impression Christianity gives. They think of the Father as one Person, sending the Son, another Person, to accomplish redemption, after which the Son sends the Spirit, yet another Person. The Spirit, in traditional thinking, comes into the believers, while the Father and Son are left on the throne. When believers pray, they are taught to bow before the Father and pray in the name of the Son. To split the Godhead into these separate Persons is not the revelation of the Bible, but the doctrine of the Nicene Creed.<p>When I was in Rome, I saw two paintings in the Vatican. One was of an old, bearded man sitting down, with a young son standing at his side, and a dove flying overhead. This picture, we were told, represented the three Persons in the Trinity. There was another painting right next to it, similar to it, with an old man sitting, a young man standing, and a dove flying above; however, this one also had a young woman standing there. Here were four persons, with Mary included! Should we not battle against such teachings until there is no place for them?<h2 class=head2>Three in One</h2><p>John 14 clearly says that the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son (vv. 10, 11). To see the Son is to see the Father. When the Son speaks, it is the Father who is working. The Two are inseparable. The Bible goes on to say that the Son, after death and resurrection, became the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The Son, in whom is the Father, has become the Spirit. Thus, the Triune God can come into the sinner. With the Spirit comes the Son; when the Son comes, the Father comes as well.<p>The term triune means three in one. From one side there are three; but from the other side they are one, because they cannot be separated.<p>Notice the three terms Paul uses in Romans 8:9 and 10. He says the Spirit of God dwells in you; that without the Spirit of Christ you are not of Him; that Christ is in you. Why does Paul use three terms to refer to the same One? It is because this One has three aspects: the aspects of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>TRIPARTITE MAN IN ROMANS 8</h2><p>Not only is God triune; man is tripartite. We human beings are spirit, soul, and body. We were created in this way, so that we could be organically grafted to God, and so that the two spirits, His and ours, could be joined together.<p>In Romans 8:10 it says, &#8220;And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.&#8221; When the Triune God enters into you, His divine life is dispensed into you and makes your spirit life. Your spirit is life. Here is a reference to your spirit.<p>Then verse 6 says, &#8220;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&#8221; The mind is the main part of the soul. Thus the mind is sometimes used in the Bible to represent the soul. In verse 10 we saw that the spirit is life. Here in verse 6 the mind, representing the soul, is also life. When we set the mind on the spirit, the life and the spirit will be infused into our mind, making it also life.<p>Verse 11 mentions our mortal bodies. &#8220;But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you.&#8221;<p>In just these few verses, then, we have the tripartite man-spirit, soul, and body-and the Triune God. It is only in these last few years, even since we did the Life-study of Romans, that I have seen the Triune God and the tripartite man in Romans 8. For Him to become our life, He first enters our spirit, making it life. Then our soul is made life by the mind being set on the spirit. Lastly, our mortal bodies are made life. The divine life thus saturates our whole being.<h2 class=head1>SATURATED WITH GOD</h2><p class=hbody>Thy Spirit will me saturate,<br>Every part will God permeate....</p><p class=hbody>Hymns, #501</p><p>Our relationship with God should reach to this extent. Our whole being must be saturated with Him. We should not be content with outwardly worshipping Him, loving Him, fearing Him, and doing things to please Him. This mysterious God has passed through a process: creation, incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. Now He has returned as the Spirit to enter all who believe in Him. Such is our God and our Savior.<p>He does not want us to worship Him from afar. He does not want us to stand in awe of Him. Nor does He want us to perform certain duties to please Him. What He wants is that we open the deepest part of our being to Him and call on His name. Then His Spirit comes into us, making our deadened spirit life. From there He spreads out. As we set our mind on the spirit, the soul too is saturated with Him. It also becomes life. From the soul, life spreads also to our mortal body. The resurrection life saturates it. When every part of us is saturated with this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, we are in the union that God wants.<p>God has no use for the religious forms of worship. He does not want us to bow, kneel, or prostrate ourselves before Him. What He wants are those who have a contrite heart and will open themselves to Him, receiving Him as their life, light, power, and even their living. The worship He wants is this union. If we give Him the opportunity to be in union with us, this is worship. To allow Him to be joined with us is what pleases Him most.<p>This is the true nature of the Christian life. For most Christians, however, Christianity has become a religion. The talk about bearing the cross, for example, is similar to what Buddhism and Hinduism teach. The talk about living uprightly sounds like the ethics of Confucius, entirely apart from God. The way God wants us to live exceeds human ethics or morality, because it is Christ Himself lived out from us.<h2 class=head1>THE SHORTCOMING OF NATURAL VIRTUES</h2><p>Let us take the example of marriage. At the wedding ceremony, the groom promises to love his wife, and the bride vows to submit to her husband. Not too many days after the wedding, however, trouble arises between this new couple. Their personalities are not compatible. The groom may be an even-tempered person, but the slowness of his wife nonetheless provokes him beyond measure. The bride, on her part, cannot stand this speedy man she has married. It seems she has no way to keep up with him. Whatever they vowed at their wedding ceremony is gone. Loving and submitting-those promises have to be thrown away.<p>In time there is some easing of the problem. Perhaps a talk with someone helps. Perhaps they hear a message which inspires them. They resolve to work out their problems. Yes, the groom thinks, I am too fast; I should be more sympathetic toward my wife. The bride too resolves she will try harder to catch up with her husband; after all, he is her head. These renewed efforts on the part of the groom to be loving and the wife to be submissive cause a great deal of suffering.<p>Suppose they succeed. The husband does find enough love for his wife, and the wife manages to submit to her husband. God does not want that. He does not want a love nor a submission which is apart from Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE SOURCE OF OUR LIVING</h2><p>Frankly, this passage in Ephesians 5 troubled me for years. From my experience it seemed to me that this word did not work. It says to love, or to submit, but this is beyond our power. If this is what God requires of us, why does He not enable us to do so? I kept studying this passage, trying to find the answer.<p>I saw that I was taking the verses out of context. Earlier it tells us to &#8220;be filled in spirit&#8221; (Eph. 5:18). The love or the submission comes from the filled spirit. There is no sense ordering the light bulbs to give light if we do not turn on the switch. Unless the electricity goes into the light bulbs, they cannot give light. Light is not a matter of their behaving; it is the expression of the electricity.<p>Loving your wife is not a matter of your proper behavior. It should be Christ expressed, His life flowing out. Submitting to your husband is not within your capacity; there is no sense looking within to find the submission. Christ Himself is the real submission. When you are filled with Him, what will come out toward your husband is submission.<p>The same is true of other virtues, like gentleness and patience. Consider how quickly your patience is exhausted. Notice how soon your gentleness disappears. Meekness is beyond your best efforts. How are you going to measure up to all these standards?<h2 class=head1>TOUCHING HIM BY CALLING ON HIS NAME</h2><p>The answer to all your shortcomings is to live out Christ. You must cease trying to love or to submit, to be gentle or to be meek. Admit that you are unable and stop trying. Simply live out Christ. Call on His name. This is not something for just the young people to do. The older sisters need to say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; too. The brothers, whatever their position in society, must also say &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; You need Him. If your situation does not allow you to call on Him loudly, you can say His name softly over and over. You will feel different inside. Because He is the true and living God, when you call on His name, you touch the Spirit. The Spirit contains the Person of the Lord Jesus. Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the Person. Keep breathing Him in in this way. Do not think you have heard such a message before. You still need to breathe! Do not feel it is embarrassing and uncultured to call on His name. It is not by being in an impressive-looking church building and acting in a dignified, solemn way that you will touch the Lord. In such places it is hard to say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; Whoever you are and whatever your position, be assured that you need Him. You need Him. Call on His name! The effect this will have on you is not merely psychological. If it were, then whatever name you say should give the same effect. Try saying, &#8220;O Socrates,&#8221; and you will see how vain it is. It is only when you call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; that you touch the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>STUDYING VERSUS EATING</h2><p>For too many years we have exercised our mind to understand spiritual matters. We have searched the Scriptures, but we have not come to the Lord for life. The Jews had only thirty-nine books to study, but we have the additional twenty-seven in the New Testament! Then, since the time of the Reformation, countless books have been written. We have been inspired by the life of Madame Guyon and tried to be like her. We have read the writings of Zinzendorf about the Moravian brothers. We have studied the writings of the Brethren. Brother Nee&#8217;s writings are available to us. We have hundreds of Life-study Messages. What has been the result of studying all these writings? Because we have not come to the Lord for life, the result has been differing opinions. We measure the church by what we have studied and conclude that things are not the way they should be.<p>Let me tell you that you are the first one who is not the way you should be. You are not breathing freely. Your spirit is plugged up. The problem is not whether things are being done correctly. It is not a matter of knowing who is doing well and who is not. The problem is a lack of the Spirit. You will not gain any life from merely understanding the Bible. Life is Christ Himself. Life is the Spirit. You must come to the Lord. I do not mean for you not to study the Bible, not to read spiritual books, and not to read the Life-study Messages. But you must come to such reading the way you come to a meal.<p>When you read a Life-study Message, you should eat and drink it! The food may not always suit your taste. You may tire of the same cooking after many years. But whether you enjoy it or not, you need the nourishment. If you do not eat and sleep properly, you will not have any energy. Sometimes you may be given too much to eat. Overeating is not good for your health either, but this is not the problem with most of you. Most of you are undernourished. You approach things in an analytical way, trying to look into this and check out that. If you go on in this way, you will end up in a coffin. Whenever you are trying to figure out who is right and who is wrong, you are eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<p>Sometimes I do not enjoy the food I am served. But whether it tastes good or not, I eat it because I know it is nourishing. I am like a car with a long way to go. If it does not have a full tank of gasoline, how can it get to its destination?<p>If you really love the Lord and are seeking after Him, turn away from your studying and your efforts to figure out what is right and wrong. Eat and drink! Praise the Lord that the Triune God has passed through this lengthy process and is now in the realm of ascension, waiting for us to contact Him. He is the Spirit. Look away from doctrines and praise Him that you also have a spirit. Your spirit is as important as the heavens and the earth. God formed your spirit so that you could contact His Spirit. These two spirits mingle as one. Live out this spirit that comes from the two spirits joined as one. Let nothing else bother you.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT, NOT DOCTRINE</h2><p>The matters of right and wrong cannot be settled. Some day they will pass away. Nor do arguments over doctrine lead anywhere except to death. We may talk about the ground of the church, but if we do not live in the Spirit, while we are preaching about oneness, we shall not be one. When we live in the Spirit, instead of the doctrine we shall have the oneness. We know there is one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body. By living in this Spirit, we are living in the Body and standing on the ground of oneness. But we do not hold this as our doctrine. We simply live in this Spirit. I have seen too much. As soon as doctrinal matters come up, everyone is divided. Whenever we are in the realm of doctrine, there are problems.<h2 class=head1>A SUMMARY</h2><p>God is Spirit and life. He has passed through a process and is now ready for us to receive Him. Praise the Lord that we have done so! His Spirit and ours are joined as one. Every moment we live in this Spirit. His divine life makes our spirit life. Then our soul becomes life by the spreading of His life, until finally our body is also life by His saturating of us. Here is what God wants: the Spirit saturating our whole being until every part is Christ. Morality and ethics cannot compare with this. When man lives himself, even the best of his living is only copper. When we live Christ, our living is gold, shining bright.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>REGENERATION, SANCTIFICATION, TRANSFORMATION, CONFORMATION, AND GLORIFICATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:15, 16; 15:16; 12:2a; 8:29, 30; 10:12; 8:4, 14</h1><p>The matter of God&#8217;s relationship with man is deep and mysterious. The grafting of the divine life and the human life into one portrays the most intimate of relationships.<h2 class=head1>THE UNION OF GOD AND MAN</h2><p>In human society the relationship between husband and wife is the closest. But the grafting together of two lives is still closer. When a branch is grafted to a tree, these two from that point on share a common life. That such a picture could illustrate God&#8217;s relationship with man is beyond human thought. Our thought is that God is high and lofty. He is to be revered as the Creator and worshipped as the Lord of all. On our side, we feel far off, small, and low; surely God and we can have nothing in common.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S PREPARATORY WORK</h2><p>But God had the intention to become one life with us. To accomplish this, He made preparations. Man&#8217;s creation was part of this preparation. He designed man so that His life could be joined with man&#8217;s life. He created man in His image and after His likeness. He breathed the breath of life into him, thus creating a spirit in him.<p>This spirit is the organ for receiving God. It gives us a spiritual sense. &#8220;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit&#8221; (John 4:24). For us to contact anything, we must use the proper organ. We have our five sense organs by which we can know the physical, material world. For seeing we must use our eyes. If we are blind, however beautiful a scene is before us, we shall not be able to realize it. To perceive scent, we must use our nose. If we have a cold and a stuffy nose, we shall not be aware of a sweet fragrance, even though others insist they can smell it. Similarly, our spirit is the organ by which we can contact God. Those who say there is no God are not using their spirit. Because they do not use the proper organ, to them God does not exist. They are not using the spiritual sense by which they could substantiate Him.<p>Such is the wonderful way in which we were made. We have God&#8217;s image, His likeness, and a spirit with which to contact Him. Thus God prepared man to be joined to Himself.<p>God also had to prepare Himself for this union. Finally He was ready. He had passed through creation, incarnation, the thirty-three years of human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Now He descended as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head1>TUNING IN TO GOD</h2><p>Both parties are now ready. All that remains to be done is for us to turn back to Him and repent. He is waiting for us to call on Him. &#8220;O Lord, I believe in You. I want You. Without You life is vanity. Without You I am empty.&#8221; When we pray this way, this marvelous Spirit will gladly enter our spirit and make us one with Him. We are like a radio with a receiver inside. When we turn on the radio and adjust the dial, we receive the sound waves and can hear the radio program. The sound waves are in the air, but we do not hear them until we tune in to them. Our spirit is the receiver; rather than exercise our mind or our emotions, we can exercise our spirit and contact God.<p>All of us at one time or another have sensed that there must be a God. Deep within we have had an assurance that there is a Lord in this universe. We may not have expressed it in words, but we have had such a sense. The source of this sense is our spirit; to impart such a feeling is one of its functions. We may not have heeded it. We may have been busy with our plans for the future. We may have given ourselves to a career or made schemes to make money. Things about God, we may have told ourselves, are too abstract and incomprehensible; let&#8217;s be practical.<p>You may be a student, working hard on your lessons. But one day you push the books aside. Why am I studying? What is the meaning of life? What does the future hold for me? These questions come not from your mind but from the deepest part of your being. You reject them, refusing to be superstitious. You turn back to your books, resolving anew to finish your schooling, to get a degree, and then go abroad for even further study. Then you will be able to marry a well educated person. You keep your mind and your hands busy.<p>This is the story of all of us. Finally a day came when we refused to pay attention to the dictates of our mind. We had a longing to walk according to our spirit. In spirit we repented, we believed, and we called on the name of the Lord. Then this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit entered into us, making the two spirits one and the two lives one. This Spirit is life. When He moves in us, our spirit becomes life. This divine life unites with our created life, making both one.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S LONGING TO BE JOINED TO MAN</h2><p>Do not think that God wants you to bow before Him, as though He were an idol. He does not want you to think of Him as being on a lofty throne. He wants to get off His throne and be in you. Even if you live in a most humble abode, He wants to be there too, because you are there. He wants to be in you. He is tired of being in heaven.<p>Do not think I am going too far. Isaiah 66:1-2 says, &#8220;Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest? For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.&#8221;<p>In these verses the Lord indicates that He has been sitting on His throne and seems to be tired of it. He has been putting His feet on the footstool and has had enough of that. Where, He asks, is the place for Him to rest? He answers His own question by saying that He finds His home in those who are of a poor and contrite spirit. He desires to rest in man rather than remain in heaven. His rest comes when He is in those with a poor and contrite spirit.<h2 class=head1>TRADITIONAL WORSHIP VERSUS WORSHIP IN SPIRIT</h2><p>Those who worship idols do so by bowing down before them. But idols are false gods, made of clay or wood, or at best gold. They are not spirit. Our God, in contrast to them, is Spirit; He can come into us. Do not treat God like an idol, by bowing down before Him; that is not the way He wants to be worshipped. Suppose there is a delicious drink on the table, containing all the ingredients it needs to taste just right. Instead of drinking it, you bow before it and pay homage to it. The glass would say, &#8220;Foolish one! Why are you kneeling there? If you leave me on the table, we both suffer. Stand up! Pick me up and drink me! Drink me!&#8221;<p>This is the relationship God wants. I know you find this hard to believe because of the way you have been brought up. I was raised in a Christian family and taught to worship in a traditional way. I might run around and be noisy outside a church building, but once I stepped inside I would be reverent. I would walk in slowly and quietly. I would sit down, bow my head, and pray. Such is the so-called worship. I practiced that from my boyhood until I was almost twenty. But I never touched God.<p>One day, however, I heard a gospel message. While I was walking home that afternoon, that message was working in me. I was not bowing before God, but right then I took that glass and drank it!<p>Do you think I am talking wildly to say that I drank God? Consider the conversation the Lord Jesus had with the Samaritan woman in John 4. He sat by that well, waiting for that thirsty woman to come. She was the one whose thirst needed to be quenched; the Lord asked her to give Him a drink just to make her aware of this. Everyone who wants to drink of the Lord Jesus has to deal with the matter of sin. When the Samaritan woman asked Him for the water, He raised this issue by telling her to come back with her husband. The mention of a husband touched the sinful life she was leading; if she wanted to drink the living water, she had to confess her sins. Her reply was to switch the subject to the matter of worship. Then the Lord told her that the real worship to God was to worship Him as the Spirit in our spirit (4:24).<p>Do you see that the Lord Jesus was there at that well for her to drink of Him? He told her, &#8220;Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever&#8221; (4:14). This water was simply Himself. He was there before her as a drink. Why would she talk to Him about worship? He was no longer on the throne in heaven. Now He was on earth, offering Himself to her, not to be worshipped but to be taken into her as a drink. John 4:14 and 24 strongly show us that to drink of Christ as the living water is the real worship to God as the Spirit in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>ASSIMILATING GOD</h2><p>However much we &#8220;worship&#8221; God, He is still God and we are still ourselves. What He wants is that we receive Him; to drink Him is to receive Him. God is not satisfied with an outward relationship. When we drink Him, He is assimilated into us, just like our food. If we eat a stone, we shall not be able to digest it, because it is not organic. But when we take something nourishing into us, it is organically assimilated.<p>So it is with the Lord Jesus. When we receive Him, He becomes part of us in an organic way. He is Spirit and life, and we can assimilate Him. After we have eaten our food and it has been digested and assimilated, even a surgeon cannot remove it from us! After we receive the Lord, we may want to get rid of Him. We may resolve not to believe in Him any longer. But it is too late! He has been assimilated into us and is part of our very being. There is no way for us to expel Him.<p>The idea of worshipping God in silence and awe is not to be found in the Bible. His people are to shout for joy (Psa. 5:11; 132:9, 16; Isa. 12:6). They are to sing (Psa. 30:4, 12; 98:4-5; Isa. 12:5) and praise Him (2 Chron. 5:13; Psa. 135:1-3; 150:1-6). When we shout for joy and praise with singing, we are eating and drinking Him. The more we do this, the more He is assimilated into us and the more we are joined to Him in one spirit.<p>Our relationship with God, then, is organic. It is a union of spirit and of life. We are one spirit and one life with Him.<p>This life relationship between God and us has five great functions or processes. Of course, our human life has its functions too. If we are ill, for example, the doctor may perform surgery. But nothing he could do would be of any help if we were dead. It is only because we have life that the techniques the doctor applies can restore us to health. This life in our physical body carries on its functions and thus sustains us.<h2 class=head1>REGENERATION</h2><p>The first function of the divine life is to regenerate us. When this life comes into us, we are born again and receive &#8220;a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father&#8221; (Rom. 8:15). This spirit of sonship, which is the Spirit of life, enters into us and makes us sons. It then becomes quite natural to call God our Father.<p>Someone once went to Brother Nee to ask how he could be sure that he was truly a son of God. Brother Nee asked him if he was married. Yes, he was. &#8220;What did you call your father-in-law the first time you met him?&#8221; was the next question. &#8220;Well,&#8221; the brother replied, &#8220;I forced myself to call him Dad, but it felt very awkward.&#8221; Brother Nee then asked, &#8220;How do you feel at home when you call your own father Dad? Does that seem awkward to you?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;That is sweet to me.&#8221; Brother Nee then pointed out to him that the awkward feeling when he called his father-in-law Dad was evidence that he was not born of his father-in-law. The tender feeling he had in saying Dad to his own father was proof that he had indeed been born of him. &#8220;How do you feel,&#8221; Brother Nee then asked, &#8220;when you call God Father?&#8221; &#8220;That is also sweet to me,&#8221; was the brother&#8217;s response. &#8220;This is an evidence that you are saved and a son of God,&#8221; Brother Nee told him.<p>Romans 8:15 has the two terms, Abba and Father; not only Abba, but also Father. This is doubly sweet. Because we have been regenerated, it is natural to us to call God Father, Abba Father. &#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God&#8221; (v. 16). Before we were born again, we were not God&#8217;s children. We were only creatures, higher perhaps than dogs or cats, but still not His children. We were created by Him and had His image and likeness, but we nonetheless did not have His life. Now-praise Him!-we have been regenerated. The spirit of sonship has entered into us to become our life. We are no longer only His creatures, but His children, with His life in us.<h2 class=head1>SANCTIFICATION</h2><p>There have been erroneous teachings concerning sanctification. In Catholicism only special &#8220;holy&#8221; people are called saints, meaning sanctified ones. But this second step, the function which follows regeneration, means the increase of God&#8217;s element in us.<p>Consider the behavior of those who are of the world, those you see at work or at school or among your relatives. Their way of living is blind. They follow whatever others do. If it is convenient to tell a lie, they have no hesitation about doing so; if they might be caught, then they do not. There is little difference among them.<p>What characterizes those in the world should not characterize us who have the Lord&#8217;s life within. There should be a separation. This is not to say that we should wear a sign, saying that we are Christians and different from others. Nor should we try to give the impression that we are superior to others.<p>Sanctification does not refer to any such artificial distinction. It is simply the adding of God to us, as day by day we open to Him. From the time we are saved and His Spirit comes into us, there should be a continual increase of His life, making us different from those around us. This change can be observed by our parents or teachers; they will see that we are not the way we used to be. We do not need a label saying we are separated from the world. There is an inward work going on, something growing up and living out of us, that makes us different from others. We are being &#8220;sanctified in the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Rom. 15:16).<p>What we are talking about is not moral improvement but a renewing in life. We are not laboring to be better behaved. The change others see comes because we have a life and a Spirit within that produces this fruit.<p>Suppose there is a tree which seems dead. There is no foliage, and the branches are dry and brittle. The root, though, is still intact. You begin to supply fertilizer and water to it. In time signs of life appear. Some tender buds sprout. The trees around it may be withered and lifeless, but this one is showing evidence of life by its newness and freshness. There is life in this tree; that is what makes it different from the other ones.<p>Sanctification is the adding of God&#8217;s element into us, making us different from others.<h2 class=head1>TRANSFORMATION</h2><p>The third process is the metabolic change that takes place in us. As God&#8217;s element is being added into us, the old elements are flushed out and replaced. In our physical body the process of metabolism never ceases. It regulates the assimilation of our food, the discharge of the dead cells, and their replacement with healthy, new ones.<p>When the Scripture tells us, &#8220;Be transformed&#8221; (Rom. 12:2), it does not mean that we should try to make ourselves different in an outward way. If my metabolism is poor, I may look pale and ill. The answer does not lie in using artificial coloring so that I seem healthy. What I need is nourishing food, adequate rest, and proper exercise. Then, after a few months, my skin color will improve, as a result of the metabolic changes that have taken place.<p>As Christians, we do not care for outward pretension. The transformation that we experience happens metabolically, as God&#8217;s element is added to us. We are being inwardly transformed, not outwardly improved.<p>The work in a mortuary is to make dead people look well. The pallid skin is masked with rosy coloring. Some messages in Christianity in effect do the work of a mortician. The object is to make lifeless ones look healthy. What a contrast this is to the Lord&#8217;s way! He cleanses away all that is false. He puts His life into us, so that we can be changed in our very being. He provides us with nourishing food and rest. Transformation is the result.<p>On our part, we need to be sure to get the proper nourishment. Without eating, we cannot have the metabolic process operate properly. It is as we nourish the divine life in us that we are transformed.<h2 class=head1>CONFORMATION</h2><p>After we have been regenerated, the life of God works within us to make us different from those of the world. As we are thus sanctified, we are changed metabolically. This transformation can be likened to a caterpillar changing into a butterfly. The result of our being transformed is that there is a new form. It is to this that Romans 8:29 refers, when it says that we were &#8220;predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the firstborn among many brothers.&#8221;<p>By transformation we are conformed to the image of our Lord Jesus. Not only is there the life within; outwardly we have the form of the Son. Notice that He is called the firstborn here, not the only begotten. Through death and resurrection He became the firstborn, with the human nature as well as the divine in Him. We shall become like this firstborn Son of God.<p>Conformation is the work God is doing today. He is not satisfied to have us only regenerated. He wants us to be conformed to the image of His Son. To accomplish this we need life. Teachings may improve us outwardly, but they do not transform us. The grafted branch is sanctified, transformed, and conformed by the life supply it receives from the tree to which it is grafted. The fruit that results from the grafting indicates maturity.<h2 class=head1>GLORIFICATION</h2><p>The life within us spreads from our inner part to our soul and eventually to our body. Glorification is when it is manifested in our body. Some day this life will permeate our whole being, and we shall be glorified (Rom. 8:30).<h2 class=head1>LETTING THIS LIFE MOVE FREELY WITHIN</h2><p>If we want the divine life in us to accomplish God&#8217;s goal, we need to give it a free way. How can we cooperate?<h2 class=head2>Calling</h2><p>Romans 10:12 tells us that &#8220;the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.&#8221; For the Lord&#8217;s life to increase in us, we need to call on the name of the Lord. If our environment allows, we can call loudly, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; If we would be disturbing others, we can simply call His name softly.<p>Calling on the Lord corresponds to breathing. We are told that it is most healthful to exercise to the extent of having to breathe deeply. When we exercise to breathe deeply the name of the Lord, we are kept healthy.<h2 class=head2>Living according to Spirit</h2><p>We must &#8220;not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit&#8221; (Rom. 8:4). We have a spirit within us. We are to walk according to that spirit, not according to our feelings, opinions, or teachings. Choosing to walk according to spirit will save us from quarreling with our spouse, from feeling unhappy toward our parents, from losing our temper, from gossiping, and from living in our vain imaginations.<h2 class=head2>Praying Every Moment</h2><p>To walk according to spirit, you must pray continually. Do not focus your prayer on various items and on different people. Pray to contact the Lord and to breathe Him in. Pray without ceasing (1 Thes. 5:17). All the time you are at home, keep praying. You must pray as spontaneously as you breathe. Christ is our life (Col. 3:4). To be detached from life means certain death. Your relationship with the Lord cannot afford any interruption.<p>It is most frustrating to lose our temper, yet humans are prone to do this. We hate the damage it does to our relationships, yet, try as we will, we keep failing. It is only when we touch the Lord, praying without ceasing, that we are kept from losing our temper. Constant prayer will keep us walking in spirit. As the element of Christ increases through prayer, we shall no longer even discuss those matters which lead to argument.<p>Gradually in our lives there will be nothing but Christ. Victory or defeat will be gone. Losing our temper or not losing our temper will not be an issue. Only Christ will matter. For this we must keep contacting the Lord and breathing Him in. Then we shall experience His constant supply.<p>In this way the life we have received in regeneration will increase. We shall be sanctified, transformed from within, and conformed to the image of the Son. When we are finally matured, His life will saturate our bodies and break forth in glorification.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>LIVE CHRIST</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 16:9; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:21a</h1><p>The central revelation of the Bible is Christ as our life to complete God&#8217;s purpose. It is God&#8217;s eternal plan to have a body of people to manifest Him. For God to be expressed through man, He must enter into him and live within him. This God, who thus becomes our life, is Christ, who is the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>MAN CREATED TO EXPRESS AND CONTAIN GOD</h2><p>The first chapter of the Bible tells us that God created man in His own image and according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26). There are two reasons why man was created in this way. The first is that he might be able to express God. Suppose I take a picture of you, but it turns out to look like a tiger. Such a picture cannot express you, because it does not look like you. For man to be able to express God, he had to be made in God&#8217;s image and likeness. The second reason is that God might one day be able to enter into man. The container must be shaped like its content. For a glove to contain a hand, the glove must be shaped like a hand, with a thumb and four fingers. When a glove is a good fit, the hand feels comfortable in it. When God enters into man, He feels as comfortable as that hand in the glove. He feels that He is where He belongs.<p>In the creation of man God used two materials: one, visible and of the earth; the other, spiritual. Man&#8217;s body was formed of the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7); this physical part was not living. Then God &#8220;breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.&#8221; In Hebrew the word breath is the same as the word translated spirit in Proverbs 20:27. The breath of life, though it could not be seen, was living. When it came into man, man became a living soul. He then had an outward body, a soul within, and a spirit within that soul.<h2 class=head1>RECEIVING GOD BY EATING</h2><p>The spirit is the organ by which man can receive God. Man was created in God&#8217;s image, yet he did not contain God. In Genesis 1 and 2 man was an empty vessel. God placed him in a garden and called his attention to the tree of life. This tree signified God Himself as life. God wanted man to receive Him; the way for man to do this was to eat of the tree of life.<p>Right at the beginning of the Bible, then, it is plain that God is received into man like food. When we eat, the food is broken down metabolically and assimilated by all the cells of our body, thus becoming part of us. When we eat Christ, we become Christ. To speak of eating God is offensive to some Christians; to say that God becomes part of us, in their view is heretical. But it was the Lord Jesus Himself who said, &#8220;He who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (John 6:57). Paul could declare, &#8220;To me to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21). His very living was Christ.<h2 class=head1>ONLY ONE COMMANDMENT FOR UNBELIEVERS</h2><p>In the Old Testament there were ten commandments. In the New, however, there are only two. The first is that we must repent and believe in the Lord Jesus. John 16:9 says, &#8220;Concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me.&#8221; For unbelievers the one sin for which they will be judged by God is that of not believing in the Lord Jesus. Whether their behavior is good or bad is inconsequential. The kind, honest people and the thieves and liars will end up in hell together, if they do not believe in the Lord Jesus. The sin for which they will be condemned is that of rejecting Him.<h2 class=head1>ONLY ONE COMMANDMENT FOR BELIEVERS</h2><p>The second commandment is for the believers: live Christ. You may not consider that this is a serious matter. I realized many years ago that it was a sin not to live Christ, but my sense was not very strong. It was last year that this conviction came upon me. One day, while I was away for a few days of rest, I was waiting before the Lord. He seemed to say, &#8220;So often you confess your sins.&#8221; This was true. Whenever an evil thought came to me, or I had a wrong attitude, or I said something wrong, I would confess. It was as routine for me to do this as for me to wash my hands. &#8220;Let me ask you,&#8221; the Lord said further, &#8220;have you ever confessed to me the one sin, that you have not lived Christ?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. Not many times have I confessed this sin.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>INFREQUENTLY LIVING CHRIST</h2><p>From that day on, I discovered that there is no end to confessing this sin. How much I lacked living by Christ! In a twenty-four hour day, how much of the time was I living Christ? Taking out eight hours for sleep, I figured that perhaps not more than two hours a day did I live Christ. The remaining fourteen hours I was not doing wrong, but neither was I living Christ.<p>How did I live Christ in those two hours? It was mainly when I was in prayer. At the beginning I would not be living Christ. I would be in my mind. But by praying I would come into my spirit and live Christ. The more I prayed, the more I would live Him. Afterwards I might be talking with my wife. I would be in spirit, but after we talked for maybe five minutes, she would ask me a question. I would reply not unpleasantly, but that question caused me to be in my mind. All the time I was answering it, I was not living Christ. I was not blaming her or even feeling angry, but I was not living Christ.<p>As the day went on, I would sense that I was off. Though I had not done anything wrong, I had not lived Christ. I confessed, &#8220;Lord, I have not lived You. I have not been in spirit. I have been living myself. O Lord, forgive this sin of mine. I am untrustworthy. Do keep reminding me that I am one spirit with You. I do not want to have anything outside the spirit.&#8221; I would be restored and again be living Him. But a telephone call might come, and again I might be drawn out of the spirit. Even without a telephone call, I might simply drift away and find I was not living Him.<p>There may be nothing wrong with the way you are living, but you may still be living apart from Christ. You may be living your morality. You may be living your own reasoning. You may be living the doctrines in the Bible. A couple may not argue, but their love may still not be in the spirit. For this they do not condemn themselves; in their eyes there is nothing sinful. A brother may feel that what he is doing is quite all right; another brother even told him he was right. He goes ahead doing it according to his reasoning. These are just examples to show you how little you live Christ. I doubt that even the best of you live Christ more than five percent of the time. The rest of the time you may not have been arguing, but neither were you living Christ.<h2 class=head1>TWO TREES</h2><p>God offered Himself to man as the tree of life, but man was deceived. He chose to eat of another tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 3:6). Everything that is not God belongs to that other tree. It is not just evil which pertains to that tree; it is also the good. Your doctrine belongs to that tree; so do your reasoning, your humility, your pride, and your morality. Both stealing and giving away all your money have their source in this tree. You may argue with your wife, or you may love her so much that you never argue with her; both are from the same tree.<h2 class=head1>CONFORMING TO AN OUTWARD STANDARD</h2><p>Yes, you have changed since you came into the church life. You used to be coarse and vulgar. Your wife had a fiery temper. But as you observed the more refined ways of the rest of those in the church, you gradually changed. I am sorry to say that you were conformed to the image of the church, not to the image of His Son. Your change was not the result of partaking of the tree of life. You may seem less rough now and look neater in your appearance. Your wife has her temper under control. Your in-laws tell others how much you both have changed since you came into the church life. Others may be impressed with your milder ways, but both your coarseness and your gentleness are from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They are not Christ.<p>When I look at your faces, I can see that you do not look like the unbelievers. Before you came into the church life, you may have painted your face like the women in the world. But when you noticed that the sisters did not wear makeup, you stopped wearing it too. Now your appearance conforms to what the others look like.<p>I used to be pleased when I saw how new ones changed after they came into the church. The long hair would be cut, the beard shaved off. I thought it was the result of life. But I came to see that it was only the outward appearance which changed; the disposition remained the same. If these new ones had truly been transformed, their whole disposition would have been different. They were not transformed; only their customs changed. They were being conformed to the local church. The length of their hair was still being determined by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<h2 class=head1>PLEASING GOD</h2><p>God is not interested in your changing outwardly. He does not ask you to wear your hair long, or short. He is not trying to make you loving instead of hateful, or humble instead of proud. God&#8217;s eternal purpose is to have Christ in you. The only thing that pleases Him is that you live Christ.<p>There is only one tree of life. All the things we do that do not come from life are from that other tree. To the tree of the knowledge of good and evil belong religion, doctrine, evil, and goodness. Whatever is not of life is of that other tree. According to man&#8217;s thinking, you should be honest, moral, and humble. God&#8217;s concern, however, is not with your behavior. It is His intention that moment by moment you live out the Christ within. Do not live according to the thoughts in your mind, your knowledge, your doctrine, or your outward circumstances. Live in your spirit, in fellowship with Christ, and according to the Spirit. This is what satisfies God.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>The church today lacks this living by Christ. Our way is right. The ground of the church is correct. On this proper ground, however, we must have the content of the Spirit. We must be filled with God. We must not be satisfied to be on the right track and to have the proper ground. There must be a practical, real testimony of living out the Spirit. We must be constantly in fellowship with Him, praying all the time, so that we have the boldness to say, &#8220;To me to live is Christ.&#8221;<h2 class=head1>THE APPLICATION</h2><p>You have learned that you must live by Christ. However, are you in this reality? Are you living Christ every day?<p>For this to be your experience, you must pray. Moreover, your prayers must not be for things or for people. If you pray only for things, you cannot pray unceasingly; you will run out of things to pray for! Your prayer must be a contacting of the Lord. To fellowship with Him in unceasing prayer is our spiritual breath, the means by which we breathe Him in.<p>It is not enough to love the Lord. To love the Lord is one thing; to live out Christ is another. I believe most of you love the Lord; otherwise, you would not be here. However, the question is whether you live Christ. God is not satisfied with your merely loving Him. Because you love Him, you must not live by yourself.<p>Over the years, young people have often come to me for help with their problems. I used to be full of answers for them. When someone wanted advice, I would give him point-by-point instructions. If a brother asked how he should handle his wife, I would give him some commandments to follow. Whatever the problem, I would have an answer. This kind of advice, I came to realize, is of no real help.<p>Now, if you come to me with a problem, I have no suggestions. I have no solutions to propose. All I can tell you is that moment by moment you must fellowship with Christ. How you should talk with your wife I cannot say. All I know is that you must be constantly breathing Christ in. While you are with your wife, you must keep communing with the Lord. &#8220;Lord, You are my life. I am one spirit with You. You are in my spirit.&#8221; Breathe Him in in this way.<p>You do not need a method. Simply fellowship with the Lord. Keep telling Him that you are one with Him, that He is within you as your life, and that He is one with you. Wherever you are and whatever you are doing, pray unceasingly to contact Him within. When this becomes your way of living, you will be out of the realm of religion and doctrine. You will be in spirit living Christ. This is what God wants.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>LIVE CHRIST ONLY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Col. 2:6, 8; Gal. 5:4; John 5:39-40</h1><h2 class=head1>THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p>God&#8217;s purpose is to work Christ into us. Christ is God&#8217;s very embodiment. To have Christ within is to have God as life within us. As the first two chapters of Genesis reveal, man was created to be God&#8217;s vessel, containing God Himself as life. Man, however, fell by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Had man partaken of the tree of life, he would have received life in its simplicity and purity.<h2 class=head1>THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</h2><p>The tree of knowledge, in contrast, is complicated. Knowledge, good, and evil all pertain to this tree. Knowledge and the good are commendable, even necessary, in the eyes of society. Of course, evil is to be rejected.<p>From childhood we have lived by knowledge. We have pursued it since kindergarten, right through elementary school, high school, and college. Even a university degree is not sufficient; we must go on for an advanced degree. Perhaps even a doctor&#8217;s degree will not satisfy us; we still continue our study and research. Knowledge, we are assured, is our future. Without knowledge, we would be of a lower class of people. Human society lives by knowledge.<p>The good is also prized by society. We appreciate high ethical standards. The Oriental peoples especially esteem humility. We take pride in giving in to others and consider that this is the highest virtue of humanity. We are pleased to offer others our seat while we stand. We greet each other by bowing low. The Westerners seem to us less civilized. They sit down without a thought as to where others will sit. They stand straight and look directly at each other when they meet. They keep whatever is theirs; it would not occur to them to offer it to someone else. The Oriental culture is surely superior to the Western!<p>The Oriental peoples are more deeply into the knowledge of good and evil. This can be seen by their more highly developed culture.<h2 class=head1>THE BASIS OF SOCIETY</h2><p>Human society is formed of these three elements: knowledge, good, and evil. These three are in the same category, though society condemns only the evil. In essence, culture is the development of knowledge and of the good. Its constituents are science, philosophy, religion, and law.<p>The universities may offer a great number of courses, but all of them are promoting one of these four constituents of culture. Any country which is strong in science, philosophy, religion, and law is strong. Imagine a country where these are lacking. Science and philosophy lead to advances in knowledge. Religion defines what is good and sets up a moral code. Law restrains man from his evil, wild desires. A country without these four would be full of robbers; its people would be like beasts.<h2 class=head1>THE PRINCIPLES WHICH GOVERN US</h2><p>Science, philosophy, religion, and law are all substitutes for Christ. Are you living by Christ day by day? You have been saved. Christ is within you. Yet very little of the time do you live Him. You may touch Him occasionally when you pray, and you may live Him part of the time when you are in the meetings. Most of the time you are in the meetings, however, you are thinking about how poor the elders are, how the brothers do not measure up to the standard, and how the sisters are disappointing. You disagree with this, and you condemn that. Instead of living Christ, you sit there criticizing and judging. You are in the realm of knowledge.<p>We may pride ourselves on our culture. What can compare with our Chinese ethics! We will forebear even if we are stabbed in the heart. We graciously give in in every situation. In addition to this national heritage, we have been raised in a Christian family and brought up in a local church. We have a knowledge of the Bible and its teachings. Why do we act the way we do? We are governed by our knowledge or scientific understanding. Why do we refrain from certain actions? It is against our ethical philosophy, or against the code we have observed in the local church. Why do we humbly give way to others? Firstly, it is because we are Chinese; secondly, it is because we are members of a local church. There are certain things we do and do not do, in order to keep our qualifications and be proper.<p>Why do you not go to the movies? You may tell me none of them are any good. You are an educated person. Movies do not appeal to you. Only uneducated, country people could enjoy that kind of entertainment. Perhaps you say that after you got saved, you felt uneasy when you went to the movies, and for that reason you stopped attending. It may well be that Christ within was restricting you at the beginning. How about now? Do you stay away from the movies because of the tradition of the local church? Do you feel condemned if you violate a local church custom? Are you trying to live up to your reputation of being a good brother? Can any of you say that what you do or do not do is because of Christ living in you? that you are not living philosophy, religion, or ethics? that you are only living Christ?<p>Sometimes a sister would like to argue with her husband. But she considers and realizes it is better not to argue. Perhaps the children are present, and she does not want them to listen to an argument; or, there may be some young people around, and she would not want to set a poor example for them. Even if no one else is present, she may refrain from arguing because she is considered a good sister in the church. Occasionally, she may not argue because of Christ within her, but this is her least frequent reason. Most of the time, instead of living Christ, she is living her children, or the young people, or her reputation in the church. The brothers are no different.<p>The elders sometimes get themselves into trouble by making decisions too quickly. You have observed that going too fast leads to problems. Some more experienced ones also advise you that, as an elder, you must learn to be cautious. They tell you that if you give quick answers, you will offend people. When others come for help, it is best to tell them you cannot answer right away; you will have to pray over the matter first. Is this living Christ? It is living by wisdom, not by Christ.<h2 class=head1>REPLACEMENTS FOR CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>The Bible</h2><p>Many Christians use the Bible as a substitute for Christ. The Lord Jesus told the Jewish religionists that they searched the Scriptures but would not come to Him for life (John 5:39-40). The Bible is a testimony to Him, but apart from Him there is no life in the letter of the Word. Because they would not go to Him for life, their search of the Scriptures was only in the dead letter.<p>In our day many are like those Jews of old. Students of theology read and study the Scriptures, yet many fail to touch the Christ who is in the Spirit and in the Word. Many ordinary Christians, too, faithfully read the Bible, yet they will not come to the One of whom it speaks. They are using the Bible as a replacement for Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Law</h2><p>The law of Moses was given by God. When Christ came, the Jews quoted from the law and would not receive Him; it was their substitute for Him. The believers in Galatia received Christ but then went back to embrace the law. Paul wrote the book of Galatians to rescue them from its snare. He reminded them that they were in Christ and had all His riches and grace as their portion. With such abundant blessing, how could they go back to Judaism? To do that was to cut themselves off from Christ. They were like a branch grafted into Christ, receiving the riches of the life of the tree. To turn back to the law was to disqualify themselves from their position in Christ and to be brought to nothing. It meant that they had fallen from grace (Gal. 5:4). Yes, the law was God-given; but its use was only temporary. Once Christ came, the law was to be put aside. They must remain in Christ and not turn back to the law.<p>You may feel that you are not trying to keep the law, so that what I am saying does not apply to you. Do you not, however, have your own laws? Especially those with a strong will have a set of laws they determine to keep. You have certain things you do and will not do. You behave properly. You consider yourself normal with a strong will, a clear mind, and proper emotions. Your life consists of your self-made regulations. These laws, as well as the law in the Bible, become a substitute for Christ.<h2 class=head2>The Gifts</h2><p>Rather than living by Christ, some people cherish tongues-speaking, or the gift of healing, or some other gift. These gifts become a replacement of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Culture</h2><p>Every nation has its culture. The book of Colossians deals with the problems that arose in the church at Colosse over the matter of culture. The believers there in Asia Minor were part Jews and part Greeks. Instead of living by Christ, they were living according to their religious ordinances or their Greek philosophy. Paul admonished them, &#8220;As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him&#8221; (Col. 2:6). Walk in Him. Do not follow the elements of the world and the tradition of men (v. 8). Do not have regard for philosophy; that is simply part of the elements of the world. Philosophy does not deserve your admiration; it is small and rudimentary. These intrusions of philosophy and tradition into the church at Colosse even in the early days caused damage to the church because such aspects of culture were replacing Christ.<p>We have a wide assortment of people in the church. There are Chinese, Japanese, Indonesians, Filipinos, and Malaysians. We also have some here from Singapore and Thailand. I would ask you, do you live by Christ or by the culture in which you have been raised? Many of you are overseas Chinese. Do you live by the Chinese culture, or by the culture of the country where you are? You may be a Chinese living by the Filipino culture, or by the Indonesian, Malaysian, or Thai cultures. Your overseas Chinese culture has been influenced by the native cultures. What you live by is this mixed culture, not by Christ.<p>Yes, occasionally Christ within directs you, but most hours of the day you are governed by something else. You are saved and have Christ within, but in actuality you are a Filipino Chinese, or a Japanese, or an Indonesian. You live according to science, philosophy, local church custom, and the ethics of your culture. You may protest that you love the Lord and are living the church life; why do I use the term local church custom? If you consider quietly, however, you will realize that you are not living by Christ. You are living something else, whether you call it the church life or local church custom. Unconsciously, you are living your culture.<p>The culture you live, moreover, is partly of your own creation. You have developed your own outlook on life. You have your own religion and philosophy. All these are distinct from everyone else&#8217;s. When you come to a crisis, you depend on this &#8220;superior&#8221; culture to carry you through. You Japanese brothers, for example, are all saved. You have the same Christ and the same Bible. You sing the same hymns and shout the same slogans. Yet not more than one hour of the day do you live Christ, forgetting yourself, forgetting Japanese culture, and forgetting each other. This may happen when you are praying or exercising your spirit in the meetings. The rest of the time you are living your self-imposed standards.<p>The same is true of those from the island of Mindanao or from Indonesia. Their life is ordered and controlled by the principles they have set up. They are critical of others who do not live up to their standard. They are pleased with how well they themselves abide by those standards.<p>The young sisters may have a high goal before them. They act properly and are grateful to the Lord for saving them and placing them in the church. But they feel they must do this and take care of that. This means they are setting up their own culture, instead of living Christ.<p>Some people are bothered by sin. To us sin may not be an issue. But the knowledge of science and philosophy, the practice of religion, and the influence of culture are still with us. It is by these that we live. We are not living Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE MEANING OF WALKING IN CHRIST</h2><p>&#8220;As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him.&#8221; We are not to live in the self, or in religion, or in the law. We are in Christ, and we are to walk in Him. We must not let the traditions of men take us away from Him. Let religion go. Let the law go. Let culture go. Stay in Christ. He is above culture, philosophy, and religion. Live Him!<p>Who is this One? He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. Do not think of Him as far off on the throne above. As the Spirit He mingles with your spirit, making you one with Him. Stay in the Spirit. Let the Spirit be in control. When you are in spirit, you live Christ. Let Him be in charge, rather than your culture.<p>You have heard messages like this before, but have quickly forgotten. Before you know it, you will once again be back in your culture, living according to local church custom. You will be considering how to get along with others. You will try to think up pleasant words to say to smooth over a situation. Remember that whenever you are not in your spirit, you are not living Christ but something else.<p>Christ is the Spirit, giving life. Outside of Him there are countless things we take as substitutes. All such substitutes are other than He. Even the study of the Bible is not Christ. Only the Spirit is Christ. We must be in that Spirit, mingled with Him. To live Christ is to live in the Spirit. Care only for this one matter: be in spirit, live in spirit, walk in spirit, pray in spirit, and fellowship in spirit. Let other things go. Simply live Christ.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4, 6b, 14; Gal. 5:25; Rev. 22:14, 17; Eph. 6:18; Rev. 1:10a; 1 Thes. 5:17, 19</h1><h2 class=head1>THE ULTIMATE REVELATION OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>After incarnation, God Himself lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years. He then went to the cross and passed through death. He was resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God. Today the Spirit as the Lord is on the throne and is also moving on earth, waiting for man to receive Him. Whoever repents, calls upon the Lord, and believes in Him will receive this wonderful Spirit and be mingled with Him as one. This mingling of man with the Triune God is the mystery of mysteries in the universe.<h2 class=head1>QUALIFIED</h2><p>In resurrection this One is complete and qualified in every way. He is the Creator. He is the Redeemer. He is both God and man; thus He has both divinity and humanity. By virtue of His having passed through death and entered into resurrection, He has within Him both the power of death and of resurrection. He has the ascension glory, the authority, and the power. He is on the throne, with both the kingdom and the glory belonging to Him. All the power of the universe is embodied in Him. We rightly call Him all-inclusive!<p>When you receive Him, this very Spirit comes into you, making you one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This One, with the power of resurrection, is in your spirit. What a joyous fact it is that we are one with this all-inclusive Christ! In Him are all the riches-humanity, divinity, power, life, holiness, and glory. They are for us now, not sometime in the future.<p>What is our part? It is simply to walk according to this Spirit. To do this is other than religion, ethics, morality, or culture. What a glorious salvation! To walk according to this all-inclusive Spirit is the essence of the whole Bible. All sixty-six books, whatever they seemingly cover, have this as their ultimate direction; they were written for this end result.<p>If you are invited to someone&#8217;s home for a meal, the kitchen will be a very busy place. The vegetables have to be washed and cut. The meat has to be sliced and seasoned. There may be water boiling on the stove. The oil must be heated for the things that are fried. If you look into the kitchen, you will see how much activity is going on and how messy everything appears. There may be smoke and steam in the air from the cooking. Eventually, however, a meal of delicious food will be placed before you for your enjoyment.<p>This kitchen activity may be likened to the process that God went through in order to be a delicious meal for us. He created the world. He became incarnate. He passed through human living. Then He entered and passed through death. Bidding death farewell, He entered into resurrection. At this point the meal was ready! When we repent and believe in the Lord Jesus, this delicious dish becomes our portion. All He would have us do is enjoy this Spirit as our portion.<p>This Spirit is both the breath of life and the tree of life in Genesis 2. The tree of life is simply the processed Triune God, who has become the Spirit and is now before you to eat and enjoy. After you receive Him, you are to eat of Him and enjoy Him.<h2 class=head1>THE DEMANDS OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</h2><p>Religion, culture, and morality all make demands. They tell you what to do. To ask &#8220;What should I do?&#8221; is to partake of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. To partake of the tree of life is to eat and drink without asking any questions. The marriage vows are a case in point. The bridegroom promises to love his wife unto death. The bride, in turn, vows to obey her husband, never turning back. The pastor exhorts them to be true to their vows, as the Scripture teaches. Do these exhortations and vows belong to the tree of life or to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil?<p>Demands that are put upon you are from the tree of knowledge. Those who instruct you in how to behave are eating from that tree. When you are invited to a feast, you go there to eat, not to keep regulations! God&#8217;s only desire is that you eat of the tree of life, not do this or that. The Bible ends with one call and one promise. &#8220;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! Let him who hears also say, Come! Let him who is thirsty also come; he who wills, let him take the water of life freely&#8221; (Rev. 22:17). The call is to come and drink of the water of life. The promise is in verse 14: &#8220;Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.&#8221; Those whose robes are washed in the blood of the Lamb may come to eat of the tree of life.<p>After I was saved, I came to love the Lord. I began to pursue Him. I wanted to be an overcomer. What I had to work on the hardest was my temper. Nothing bothered me so much as my quick temper. Though I dearly loved my mother, when my temper got the upper hand I would say things to her that I would afterwards deeply regret. Because of my longing to overcome my temper, I bought a good number of books on the subject of how to overcome or the way to be holy. When I first read them, they seemed to make sense. When I tried to put them into practice, however, I found they did not give much real help. Only later did I come to realize that books of that type only teach their readers to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<h2 class=head1>THE SUPPLY OF THE TREE OF LIFE</h2><p>What does the Bible teach? The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly....I am the bread of life....He who eats Me shall also live because of Me&#8221; (John 10:10; 6:48, 57). He did not come as a teacher. He did not come as a pastor, to give you scriptural advice about how to get along with your spouse. He came as bread for you to eat! Eat Him! Do not ask Him what you should do.<p>But this is a hard word. You cannot take in the matter of eating Him. You want to learn how to deal with your wife. What method should you use? What would be the proper psychology? To use your mind to work out your problems is to eat of the tree of knowledge. The tree of life does not need to be analyzed and understood; it is simply to be eaten.<p>Many Christians admire the eloquence of their pastor. They enjoy his weekly sermon. Sometimes he talks of heaven; other times, of earth. He talks about the future and about the past. His audience finds his words stimulating, inspiring, and challenging. They think they are receiving sound guidance for their daily path.<p>Alas! They are feasting on the tree of knowledge. The Lord wants to be eaten, but we refuse. When we read the Bible or hear a preacher, we pay attention and try to learn. The tree of life, however, is for eating, not for understanding. In John 6 the Lord calls Himself the true bread out of heaven (v. 32); the bread of God who gives life to the world (v. 33); the bread of life (v. 35); and the living bread (v. 51). He is to be eaten!<p>We long to have advice. Formerly, I would easily give suggestions when various ones came to me with problems. What I was really doing was teaching them to eat of the tree of knowledge. Now, if you check with any young people who have come to me for help, they will all tell you I had no advice to give them except to eat the Lord. Nonetheless, you still want to know what to do, what course you should follow, what method you should use. You are probably thinking, &#8220;Yes, it is all very well to eat the Lord. But when my husband loses his temper with me next time, how shall I handle the situation? What method will alleviate matters? How shall I react?&#8221; When you ask questions like that, you turn back to the tree of knowledge.<h2 class=head1>A WALK ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2><p>Rather than imagining what might happen later, stay in fellowship with the Lord. &#8220;Lord, You are the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. You are living in my spirit. You and I have become one spirit. I would just abide here in my spirit with You.&#8221; Go home in peace. Do not wonder what you will do if such-and-such happens. Simply follow the Spirit. There is no reason to ask anyone what you should do. Praise the Lord that He is within you and that you are one spirit with Him. Keep talking to Him in this way. When you get home, if your husband confronts you at the door and asks, &#8220;Where have you been? How come you don&#8217;t want to take care of the house?&#8221; still do not react. Keep saying, &#8220;Lord, I am one spirit with You. You are the life-giving Spirit.&#8221; He may say, &#8220;Oh, you are so spiritual! Is the Lord in your spirit and not in mine?&#8221; Just keep thanking the Lord that He is within you, giving life to you. If your husband then proposes, &#8220;How about fixing something for us to eat?&#8221; keep walking according to the Spirit. I believe the Spirit will constrain you to go into the kitchen and cook for him. As you are working there, say, &#8220;Lord, You are the life-giving Spirit within my spirit. Hallelujah!&#8221;<p>If you will live in this way, you will be walking according to Spirit. You do not need to know what the standard is for a good husband or wife. You do not need to think about honoring your parents. You do not need to consider how to love people or how not to lose your temper. All your being is toward this One who is the life-giving Spirit indwelling your spirit.<p>This is a glorious way to live. Practice it! You will be out of the realm of religion, morality, and the law. There will be only Christ. You will be in the good of God&#8217;s intention. It is His heart&#8217;s desire to live in you as your life and your person. What I am proposing is not superstition or empty doctrine. Surely you have already had some experience of this. Think back to a time when you prayed yourself into the spirit. It made you forget heaven and earth. You and the Lord were one, and it seemed there was nothing else. &#8220;O Lord! O Lord! It&#8217;s so good to be here with You!&#8221;<h2 class=head1>LIVING IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF PRAYER</h2><p>This spirit of prayer must be the realm in which we live. Bring this atmosphere into your daily life. Pray without ceasing. This does not mean to keep praying for all different matters all the time. To pray without ceasing means to breathe in the Lord and enjoy Him constantly. It means to stay in the realm of the Spirit where the Lord is with you and you are with Him. Do not quench this Spirit.<p>If you are willing to practice this, the element of the Lord will increase in you from day to day. A sanctifying process will take place. Things that others do will no longer appeal to you. What you formerly enjoyed you will no longer have any interest in doing. Your smart remarks will not be forthcoming. Your taste in clothing will be different. These changes will be the result of the Lord&#8217;s increase in you, not of an effort at outward conformity. Because you are one spirit with the Lord and walk according to this spirit, the result will be that you are transformed and made holy. Without any intention, you will be an overcomer.<p>Pray daily. &#8220;Lord, I love You. Attract me, that I may love You more. Rekindle my love for You this very day. Every day I want my love for You to be fresh and sweet. Come and make Your home in my heart. You are the One I desire.&#8221;<p>To thus declare your love for the Lord and to invite Him to make His home in your heart is not an insignificant matter. Suppose you expressed your love to someone of your acquaintance and your longing that that one come and live with you. How deeply moved that person would be! This One whom you are inviting is the Lord of heaven, the Creator, the incarnated, crucified One who is now the Spirit. In Him are the power of the resurrection and the riches of the ascension.<p>He is pleased to come when you invite Him! He Himself said, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&#8221; (John 14:23). The Father and Son will live in you!<p>Is this mere fanciful talk? Is the Lord Jesus real? Is it true that He now is the all-inclusive Spirit? Praise the Lord, it is real! When you say, &#8220;Lord, I am here. Come and live in me,&#8221; He will come. You will enjoy His presence, sweetness, comfort, and supply from within. This will be your experience, even though you cannot describe it precisely. Unbelievers will wonder what kind of person you are and what makes you that way.<h2 class=head1>IN SPIRIT</h2><p>In the last book of the Bible there was one who said, &#8220;I was in spirit on the Lord&#8217;s day&#8221; (Rev. 1:10). May this be true of all of us. &#8220;Lord, make me one who is in spirit. May all my days on earth be the Lord&#8217;s day. I want to be one who is in spirit.&#8221; With all of us so exercised to be in spirit, enjoying God and man mingled together, we have the church life today. Tomorrow we shall have the New Jerusalem. This is the eternal purpose of God, His heart&#8217;s desire, and His greatest pleasure.<p>Nothing pleases Him more than your being one spirit with Him and walking according to that spirit. Do you love the Lord? Then enjoy this mingling with Him! Do not worry about the criticisms of others. Do not have rules to follow. Do not have secondary considerations. Simply love Him, walk in spirit, be mingled with Him, and fellowship with Him in spirit. &#8220;Lord, I love You. You and I have become one spirit. I am living in You. You are living in me. I want my walk to be in You and according to spirit.&#8221; Here is overcoming life, light, power, riches, spirituality, holiness-the church life!<p>Do you see how different it is to walk in spirit than to be in religion? The Triune God has become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. He is now living in your spirit, so that He and you are one mingled spirit. In this one spirit pray, fellowship with Him, and be joined with Him. Walk according to this one spirit!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD&#8217;S MYSTERY AND GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Col. 2:2b, 9; Heb. 1:3a; John 1:1, 14, 18; Col. 1:25-27; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6</h1><h2 class=head1>GOD EXPLAINED AND EXPRESSED</h2><p>The Bible says that Christ is the mystery of God (Col. 2:2). If we want to know God, then, we must know Christ. God is true and living, but He is mysterious. Christ explains Him. This He does, not only by His words, but mostly by His very Person. &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#8221; (John 1:18). Man cannot see God, but there is One who declares Him. He is God&#8217;s expression.<p>In Hebrews 1:3 He is called the effulgence of God&#8217;s glory and the express image of His substance. Electricity cannot be seen, but when the lights shine we can see its glory. God is like the invisible electricity; Christ is His shining forth, the effulgence of His glory. God has an eternal essence, which is not material but spiritual. It is because the Lord Jesus expresses this essence, God&#8217;s very substance, that He is the mystery of God. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him (Col. 2:9). Where He is, there God is, for He Himself is God.<p>The first chapter of the Gospel of John goes into this matter also. The Word was in the beginning, the Word was with God, and the Word was God (v. 1). How could the Word be God? How could the Word become flesh (v. 14)? In our mentality the Word is one thing, God is something else, and the flesh is another thing. John tells us that these three are one. &#8220;Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh&#8221; (1 Tim. 3:16). When the Word became flesh, God was manifested in the flesh. This is the Lord Jesus, the mystery of God.<p>We all need to be brought &#8220;unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ&#8221; (Col. 2:2). Have you seen God? Your answer should be, &#8220;I have seen Christ!&#8221; God is in Christ, and Christ is God. Apart from Christ, you cannot find God. To have Christ is to have God. To belong to God is to belong to Christ. With God there is a mystery, but with Christ the mystery is revealed.<p>God has been revealed. We can contact Him. We can fellowship with Him. We can walk with Him. We are even one spirit with Him, because we are one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). We have God because we have Christ, who is the mystery of God.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h2><p>The word economy means an arrangement for getting things done. Young people make studying their economy. Cooking is the economy of a cook. Businessmen operate under an economy; that is, they have a way of doing things in order to accomplish their ends. Only those who are idle have no economy. Since our God neither slumbers nor sleeps (Psa. 121:4), surely He has an economy.<p>What is God&#8217;s economy? Christ! Laboring in the kitchen may be the cook&#8217;s economy. She may be hard at work, preparing meat, vegetables, fish, and bean curd. What is God doing in His kitchen? He is preparing Christ. Every dish that He turns out for our enjoyment is simply Christ! I am not speaking nonsense! The Lord Jesus told us that He is the bread of life (John 6:48). When we break the bread, we are touching His body. Colossians 2:16-17 says that eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are all &#8220;a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.&#8221; Bean curd is a shadow; the body of the bean curd is Christ. He is the most nutritious food, much better than bean curd! When you are thirsty, you like to have a refreshing drink. Have you not had the experience of calling on the Lord when you feel dry within, and finding yourself refreshed? The material drink is only a shadow of Christ as the real drink.<p>For more than thirty years I have been speaking on the tree of life, on the enjoyment of God through eating and drinking Him, and on Christ as God&#8217;s economy. It seems that we still do not have a thorough understanding, and therefore our experience is limited. My own experience also seems inadequate. God&#8217;s economy is mysterious, rich, and profound. It is the focus of the whole Bible. Even at the end of the Bible there is the promise of the tree of life to those who wash their robes (Rev. 22:14) and a call to the thirsty to come and drink of the water of life (v. 17). In this final chapter of the Word, eating of the tree of life and drinking of the water of life are again brought into view.<h2 class=head1>COMPLETING THE WORD OF GOD</h2><p>Paul tells us that his ministry was to complete the word of God (Col. 1:25). Without his Epistles God&#8217;s word is not complete. There were the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, the four Gospels, and the Acts. The Old Testament foretold the coming of Christ, the Gospels presented Him to us, and the Acts spoke further of Him. But Christ is so great there was much more to be said of Him. The stewardship given to Paul concerned &#8220;the mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations, but now has been manifested to His saints; to whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221; (vv. 26-27). The hidden mystery is Christ in you; without Christ in us, God&#8217;s revelation would not be complete. It would be like making a shirt and having it all finished except for the collar; when Paul came, he added the collar!<p>We cannot exhaust who Christ is. In the Old Testament, in the Gospels, and in the Acts we find that He is God, the Word of God, man, flesh, the Lamb of God, the Redeemer, the rock, the Shepherd, the Savior, the Physician, the Prophet, the King, the High Priest, the door, the way, the green pasture, righteousness, light, power, life, and peace. He is far more than these, as these parts of the Bible indicate. Not until we come to the writings of Paul, however, are we made clear that this all-inclusive Christ is in us.<h2 class=head1>THE INCOMPLETENESS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p>The Old Testament does not cover this. Genesis 3 says that the seed of the woman will bruise the serpent&#8217;s head (v. 15). Christ is that seed. Christ is also the seed of Abraham, in whom all the nations of the earth shall be blessed (Gen. 22:18). In Isaiah 9:6 He is the child born to us, and the son given. The government is on His shoulder. He is called Wonderful, Counselor, mighty God, everlasting Father, and Prince of peace. In Haggai 2:7 He is referred to as the Desire of all nations. Malachi 4:2 calls Him the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings; that is, there is healing in His rays.<p>This is a sampling of many references to Christ in the Old Testament, but none says Christ is within us.<h2 class=head1>THE INCOMPLETENESS OF THE GOSPELS</h2><p>The light in the Gospels is more specific, telling us of this dear Christ who has come. He is the Son of Abraham and the Son of David, born of the virgin Mary. He was the Word from the beginning. This Word was God and became flesh. We cannot see clearly, however, that this Christ who has come will come into us and be our person. John hints at this, but the Lord&#8217;s words seemed to bewilder the disciples. &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter...the Spirit of reality....He abides with you and shall be in you&#8221; (John 14:16-17). When the Lord Jesus was with them, He could not be in them. But on the day of resurrection they would experience the Spirit of reality and know that they were in Him and He in them.<p>This is apparently all He could say to them. Had He spoken further, they would only have been confused. They had to wait for that day; then they would know. &#8220;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&#8221; (John 14:20). It was unto this end that He prayed in John 17. &#8220;As You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us&#8221; (v. 21). Do you think Peter and the other disciples understood these words that the Lord prayed? What does it mean to be one in the Father and in the Son?<p>The explanation came with Paul. Again and again in his writings the term &#8220;in Christ&#8221; appears; again and again he told the believers that Christ was in them. It was his commission to complete the word of God by making the saints clear that Christ was in them.<h2 class=head1>&#8220;CHRIST IN YOU&#8221;</h2><p>In my early Christian years I loved the Lord, but I was not taught about Christ being in me. Instead, I was given considerable instruction in prophecy. I learned the meaning of Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream in Daniel 2 and of the four beasts in Daniel 7. With all my studying and instruction, however, I was never taught &#8220;this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221; (Col. 1:27). Words cannot express what a revelation it was to me when I realized this mystery. Christ in me!<p>Even today some Christians oppose this. During my recent visit to Taipei, I was preaching from Romans that we are vessels having God Himself as our content (9:23). I later heard that a traveling evangelist who was listening protested, asking how such a big God could possibly fit into such a small container as man. How pitiful that a preacher could be so ignorant! Does the Bible from which he preaches not say that Christ is in us? Is the Lord Jesus not bigger than we? The Bible clearly states that this big Christ is contained in us small human beings.<p>Of course, we cannot explain how this could be. It is a mystery. Even in the natural realm there are many things for which we have no explanation. We know the facts, but not the whys. We can utilize electricity, for example, but why it works as it does we do not know. How the great God can fit into His small creature is a puzzle, but we know that this is the case because the Bible tells us so. I have spent many years mining the Bible to dig out its riches, seeking to find the answers.<p>A young, married sister once interrupted my speaking in a meeting to ask how we could abide in the Lord and the Lord abide in us. I told her to hold her question, that I would come to it later. I then continued my speaking on this matter of Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit. The word spirit in Greek, I said, is the same as the word for air. To say that the Lord is the Spirit of life is to say that He is the breath of life. I then addressed myself to her. &#8220;Sister, you are now abiding in the air, and the air is abiding in you. Otherwise, you would not be alive. Because the Lord Jesus is the breath of life, we are in Him just as we are in the fresh air. The air that is in us is like the Lord Himself in us.&#8221;<p>The Lord Jesus can be in us because in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Were He not the Spirit, He could not abide in us. &#8220;Now the Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17)!<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT IN REVELATION</h2><p>There are some mysterious verses in Revelation about the Spirit. In 1:4 John greets the seven churches which are in Asia: &#8220;Grace to you and peace from Him Who is, and Who was, and Who is coming, and from the seven Spirits Who are before His throne.&#8221; Who or what are these seven Spirits? They are the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne (4:5). They are the seven eyes of the Lamb (5:6).<p>These seven Spirits are surely the one Spirit, the Holy Spirit. How then can there be seven? When the book of Revelation was written, the churches were degraded and in darkness. With the churches in such a low condition, the Spirit needed to be intensified sevenfold. The lampstand in the tabernacle had seven lamps (Exo. 25:37). The amount of light we need from a lamp depends on how dark it is. We may have a lamp at home with a three-way bulb. If we are reading, we may turn it on all the way so as to get the most light. On the other hand, if it is early evening, we may get enough light turning it only once. In Revelation the churches were too weak and too dark; the light was not enough. It needed to be intensified. This intensified light is the seven Spirits.<p>The traditional view of the Trinity breaks down when confronted with seven Spirits and the seven eyes of the Lamb. If the Godhead is categorized into three separate and distinct Persons, what can we do with this description of the Spirit of God in Revelation? Christ, the second Person, is the Lamb, but His seven eyes are the seven Spirits, the third Person. The Holy Spirit here is the eyes of Christ. Can we think of a person&#8217;s eyes as other than himself? If we are hit in the eye, have we ourselves not been hit? Are we one person and our eyes another? Theology&#8217;s explanation of the Trinity comes from mental exercise; it cannot stand the test of practical experience. In our experience the Holy Spirit is indeed the eyes of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE SEVEN SPIRITS FOR TODAY</h2><p>Is the age today not dark? Is it not degraded? What we need is the seven Spirits. Christ today is not only the Spirit, but the seven Spirits. These seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ, walking among the churches.<p>The Christ in you has seven eyes! He is watching and shining in you. However troublesome the doctrine sounds, in your experience you are surely aware of His eyes upon you. The more you love the Lord, the more you sense His searching of you and the clearer the vision is. From whatever angle you try to avoid His searching gaze, those seven eyes do not miss anything. A light word, some impulsive greediness, or some covetousness-all bring the seven eyes to focus on you. Wherever you go you cannot escape.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST DISPENSED INTO US</h2><p>The Christ God has dispensed into us is salvation and life. He is not a doctrine or a religion. He is the living, life-giving One with seven eyes, watching and penetrating our being. The result is that we become transparent. This indicates that Christ has been worked into us.<p>To God Christ is His mystery; to us Christ is God&#8217;s economy. God&#8217;s dispensing is still going on. Whether we are praying at home, attending morning watch, pray-reading, or fellowshipping with each other, God is dispensing Himself into us. Even when we deal with our sins, repenting and confessing, God is dispensing. The Christ He dispenses is not just the Spirit, but the seven Spirits.<p>Praise the Lord that we are in His economy! Christ, the mystery of God and the economy of God, is being dispensed into us.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>HOW THE LORD BECAME THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:14; 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17a; Rom. 8:16; Phil. 1:19b; Exo. 30:22-26</h1><h2 class=head1>MISTRANSLATION DUE TO MISUNDERSTANDING</h2><p>In the New Testament there is a term which has been largely overlooked by biblical scholars and ordinary readers as well. That term is the Spirit. A number of times in the original Greek the definite article is used with the word Spirit. Sometimes the is translated literally, but other times it is blurred over. In the Chinese version 2 Corinthians 3:17, for example, is correctly rendered, &#8220;Now the Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; However, quite often instead of translating the Spirit literally, the word Holy is added, along with three dots to indicate that the word was not in the original. This was done with Romans 8:16, for example; &#8220;The Spirit Himself&#8221; is rendered &#8220;Holy Spirit&#8221; in the Chinese.<p>...<p>This same verse has another inaccurately rendered word in the Chinese version. Rather than saying &#8220;with our spirit,&#8221; as it is in Greek, the rendering is &#8220;with our heart.&#8221; The scholars who did the Chinese translations were well versed in Greek and Hebrew. There were seven translators, most of them British and American, assisted by well qualified Chinese scholars. Generally speaking, the translation is an excellent one. The literary style and the sentence structure leave little to be desired. What the translators lacked, however, was an accurate knowledge of spiritual things. It would be a serious error, physiologically speaking, if we used heart when we were referring to the lungs. In referring to our psychological makeup, it is no less important to differentiate between our spirit and our heart.<p>This distinction between spirit and heart is clear in the Old Testament. Ezekiel 36:26 says, &#8220;A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.&#8221; Heart and spirit are clearly two different entities. We should not use the two terms interchangeably.<p>In John 4:24 the Chinese translation again shows the lack of spiritual understanding on the part of the translators. Instead of going along with the Greek and saying that God is to be worshipped in spirit, the Chinese version has heart-spirit. The Greek word for spirit is pneuma; for heart, it is cardia. We need to maintain the scriptural distinction in their usage.<p>Over thirty years ago, one day in Shanghai I sat down with Brother Nee and asked, &#8220;Brother Nee, what is heart-spirit?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Heart-spirit! There is no such thing, anymore than there can be a heart-lung. Heart is heart, spirit is spirit, and lung is lung. These are all separate organs. They cannot be mixed up.&#8221;<p>Please be assured that the New Testament books we have translated are not an effort to alter the meaning of the original. Our object is to make the translation as accurate as possible. It takes a great deal of research and consideration to select the right words. We have in hand over forty different English translations of the Bible. Before we decide how to translate a certain word, we check the different ways it has been translated already. Many differing opinions are revealed by the various translations! We also have numerous reference books, such as lexicons, concordances, and word studies, that help us arrive at our translation. We further study the usage of the word in question. How was the word used in ancient times? What is its modern usage? How is it used elsewhere in the New Testament? To all these considerations we add our understanding of spiritual matters. Then we make our decision as to how the word will be translated.<h2 class=head1>EXPERIENCED WORKERS VERSUS LANGUAGE THEORISTS</h2><p>Accurate translation requires more than a knowledge of the two languages in question. There must be an understanding as well. Suppose, for example, you have a doctorate in language. You are asked to translate a manual for a computer you have never seen before. You read the manual and understand all the words, but you still have no idea how to make the computer work. The technical terms mean nothing to you. You need the help of the one who is experienced in operating the machine. He may not be very familiar with the manual, but he knows the machine. If you and he work together, you can come up with quite an accurate translation of the manual.<p>Those seven Western scholars are like the one asked to translate the manual. Their educational background, both in the biblical languages and in Chinese, was superior. Their Chinese assistants were also scholars in their own right. In spite of such rich literary knowledge, however, they did not know the machine they were working with!<p>We are the simple workers. Though lacking their background, we have been operating this machine for more than fifty years! When we looked at the manual they put out, even while appreciating their scholarship, we laughed at some of their renderings. From our experience we knew that Romans 8:16, for example, must refer to the spirit, not the heart. We were forced to track down the meaning of the original. This meant learning a little Greek. We began to check the reference works too and found out that the Greek word in Romans 8:16 was pneuma. Then we looked up the word heart, as in 2 Corinthians 3:16, &#8220;The veil is upon their heart.&#8221; We found out that this word is cardia. It is inadmissible to translate these two different words as though they meant the same thing. In scholarly background and literary style we cannot match those who did the Chinese version; but by the Lord&#8217;s grace, as far as experience is concerned, we have been touching this machine for many years and are more or less familiar with how it works!<h2 class=head1>JOHN 7:39</h2><p>Another example of a problem verse is John 7:39: &#8220;But this He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&#8221; The Chinese translation of this verse again adds &#8220;Holy&#8221; before the word Spirit and, like the King James Version, has &#8220;was not yet given.&#8221;<p>At the time of the incarnation, the angel told Mary that the Holy Spirit would come upon her (Luke 1:35; cf. also Matt. 1:20). If the Holy Spirit came upon Mary, why thirty-three years later was the Holy Spirit &#8220;not yet given&#8221;? Again, the translators of the Chinese Bible betrayed their inadequate understanding of the Spirit; because of their unfamiliarity with the machine, they misunderstood the manual and therefore mistranslated some of the terms. Christ was speaking of the Spirit; it was the Spirit who was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been resurrected.<p>To some of you these words may sound strange. Are not the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit three in one? What does the term &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; mean? Am I adding a fourth one to the Trinity? Or, am I saying there were only two in the Trinity until the resurrection? By no means! Thirty years ago we saw this light concerning the Spirit. We saw that when the Lord Jesus arose from the dead, He became the Spirit. The Scripture clearly tells us that the last Adam, who is the Lord Jesus, became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Surely this Spirit cannot be one thing and the Holy Spirit another!<p>For many years I was groping to come to an understanding of this matter of the Spirit and particularly of John 7:39. To change the translation of the Bible because we do not understand it is inexcusable. Even with the correct translation, however, I still was not clear. The Bible is God&#8217;s revelation; it is to be expected that we would find some parts hard to grasp. To know the Bible only from a literary or linguistic point of view is to remain in ignorance of its true content. For many things in the Bible, we need God&#8217;s enlightening. Rather than lean to our own understanding, we must seek to experience what the Word says. Year after year I would keep asking the Lord, What is this matter of the Spirit? Why does the Word say, &#8220;The Spirit was not yet&#8221;?<h2 class=head1>THE ANOINTING OINTMENT</h2><p>Finally I realized that we have a clear picture of this distinction between the Spirit and the Spirit of God in the Old Testament. To comprehend an abstract term like the Spirit is not easy; but by means of this picture I was greatly helped.<h2 class=head2>Spices Added to the Oil</h2><p>I came in my reading to Exodus 30, where Moses was commanded to make an oil of holy ointment (Exo. 30:22-26). The ointment, I read, was made of a hin of olive oil with four spices added to it. Oil, as I had known for many years, is a type of the Holy Spirit (see Psa. 45:7; Isa. 61:1). When the four spices were mingled with the oil, it became a compound ointment, no longer plain oil. We could say that before the spices were blended in, the ointment &#8220;was not yet&#8221;! There was only the olive oil. It dawned on me that here was a picture of how the Spirit of God became the Spirit. How excited I was to see this! Before the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection, the oil of the Spirit of God lacked the myrrh of Christ&#8217;s death and the cinnamon of its sweetness; it lacked the calamus of His resurrection and the cassia of its sweet flavor. When the Lord in resurrection became the Spirit, to the Spirit of God were added these elements of death and resurrection. Do you see how much richer this ointment is than the plain olive oil?<p>Believers throughout the generations have been deprived of an adequate understanding of the Lord as the Spirit, and of the Holy Spirit, and of the Spirit of God. The Father and the Son, it was generally believed, were Persons. Until over a century ago, however, the Spirit was commonly regarded as only a power, or an instrument, or an influence, rather than a Person. In Romans 8:16 and 26 the King James Version has &#8220;the Spirit itself&#8221; rather than &#8220;the Spirit Himself.&#8221; To translate this pronoun as neuter is an indication that the translators did not regard the Spirit as a Person.<p>After the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit. Besides being referred to as the Holy Spirit, new terms are used from this point on: a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45); the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7, Gk.); the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9); and the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). The Spirit of God, or the Holy Spirit, today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the One who was incarnate, who died, and who was resurrected.<h2 class=head2>A Bountiful Supply</h2><p>This enriched Spirit, Philippians 1:19 tells us, has a supply. The word supply in Greek is difficult to translate; it is more accurate to render it &#8220;bountiful supply.&#8221; In ancient times the Greeks had singing groups, whose leader was required to furnish the singers with whatever they might need, whether food, drink, clothing, or musical instruments. From him came &#8220;the bountiful supply&#8221;! When Paul wrote this word, he was in a Roman prison. He said that he would be saved through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Whatever he needed, this Spirit would supply.<p>Let us go back to the anointing ointment. One of its spices is myrrh, which denotes the death of Christ. Cinnamon, another of the spices, refers to the fragrance of that death. Calamus, the third spice, is a reed that grows out of muddy places. It typifies the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. Cassia, the last spice, belongs to the same family as cinnamon and speaks of the fragrance of the resurrection. In ancient times it was used as repellant, especially for snakes. In the resurrection there is no place for Satan, the old serpent; he and his demons are repelled.<p>This ointment, with all its spices, is to be your bountiful supply in daily life. In it are found patience, humility, love, wisdom, and holiness. The sweetness of the spices will chase away all the demons.<h2 class=head2>The Measure of the Spices</h2><p>Notice the amounts and proportions of the spices: myrrh, 500 shekels; cinnamon, 250 shekels; calamus, 250 shekels; and cassia, 500 shekels.<p>If we combine the middle two measures, we have three units of 500 shekels. This is a picture of the Trinity, with the second One split on the cross. Four, the number of the spices, is the number of man. The three of the Trinity and the four of man are mingled together, making the number seven, an addition of God and man in time (as, for example, the seven churches in Revelation). In eternity the mingling of God and man is represented by the number twelve, the multiplication of three and four. This is the number repeatedly used for the New Jerusalem (twelve gates, twelve foundations, twelve fruits).<h2 class=head1>THE LORD BECOMING THE SPIRIT</h2><p>In the Old Testament there was only the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah. The Holy Spirit as a divine title is not used until the Lord Jesus became flesh (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:20). In Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10, 11, the three places in the Old Testament where the King James Version has &#8220;Holy Spirit,&#8221; the translation should be &#8220;the Spirit of Thy holiness&#8221; and &#8220;the Spirit of His holiness.&#8221;<p>God was alone in eternity. Then &#8220;in the beginning&#8221; He created. In the fullness of time He became incarnate. After His thirty-three and a half years of human living, He was crucified and buried. Three days later He was raised from the dead and ascended to the heavens, where He was crowned with glory and honor, made Lord and Christ, and became the Head. After all this came the day of Pentecost, when He descended and entered into man. Those who were thus regenerated formed a corporate entity, the church.<p>God was no longer alone. He was now one with man. The lengthy process that God went through paved the way for Him and man to be one. Every step was needed. Without creation, man would not have existed. Without the incarnation, man could not have been saved and brought back to God. Without the years of human living, God in Jesus of Nazareth would not have tasted the common lot of man. Without the cross, He would not have solved the problem of sin and terminated the old creation. Without the resurrection, He would not have become Head of the new creation and the life-giving Spirit. Without the ascension, He would not have received the glory, lordship, and headship. All these were the necessary steps for Him and man to be one.<p>When He descended as the Spirit, in Him were God, man, human living, death, the sweetness of that death, resurrection with its fragrance and its power, ascension, glorification, enthronement, lordship, and headship. This enriched Spirit is called the Spirit of Jesus mainly referring to Him in His humanity (Acts 16:7, Gk.) and the Spirit of Christ mainly referring to Him in resurrection (Rom. 8:9-11), and then the Spirit of Jesus Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit (Phil. 1:19).<p>The Spirit is no longer only olive oil, but a compound Spirit, a compound ointment, anointing us (1 John 2:27). The anointing is the moving of the ointment. This rich Spirit, incorporating both divinity and an uplifted humanity as well as all the experiences of Christ, is now our portion. This is the Spirit who is with our spirit. The two spirits become one! The outcome is a corporate man, the new man, the church, enjoying this bountiful supply.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE LIFE SUPPLY OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:2, 9-11; Phil. 1:19b; 2 Cor. 3:6b</h1><p>What kind of relationship does God want us to have with Him? Some people reject the idea of God, or at least choose to ignore Him; they want nothing to do with Him. Others, perhaps out of fear, want to know what they should do to please Him and how they should worship Him. Our human concept tells us that we must do good if we want to please Him. In a superficial way the Bible seems to lend support to such concepts. It tells us that we should worship and fear God, that we should do His will, and that we should do our best to please Him.<p>Such a relationship to God fits our natural concept. For the most part, the religious instruction we have received, even in Christianity, reinforces this innate desire we have to fear, love, and serve the Supreme Being.<p>The true intent of God as revealed in the Bible, however, far exceeds what man has conceived. It is so profound that without light from God we cannot grasp it. God wants to be in man, to work Himself into man, and to be man&#8217;s life to such an extent that He becomes man and man becomes one with Him.<p>Although at times we may see a little glimmer of light regarding God&#8217;s desire, our daily living remains unaffected. We go on trying to love God, to fear Him, and to please Him. We give little consideration as to how we can let God be our life and how we can be one with Him.<h2 class=head1>THE INCARNATION</h2><p>When God partook of human form (Phil. 2:7), that is, when &#8220;the Word became flesh&#8221; (John 1:14), His name was called Jesus. He lived as a simple carpenter in a humble home. There was no majesty about Him. He had &#8220;no form nor comeliness&#8221; (Isa. 53:2). Think of it! The infinite God became a finite being, living and working on this earth for thirty years. Jesus of Nazareth was the one man who was in union with God. Within was God; without was man. God lived in man, and man lived out God.<p>When the Bible describes the life of this One, there is little mention of His keeping outward forms of worship. Rather, His life is described as being intertwined with the Father&#8217;s. &#8220;The living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father....I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me. The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works&#8221; (John 6:57; 14:10). The Father and the Son were one. The Father was in the Son as the Son&#8217;s life, and the Son lived out the Father. They were two Persons with one life, that of the Father, and one living, that of the Son.<p>Such a relationship with God is not in man&#8217;s concept. But this union of God and man is not only for Jesus of Nazareth. In Jesus there was God. God wants you also to have Him within. God was the life of Jesus Christ. God wants to be your life also. Jesus lived out God. You are also to live Him out.<p>Can you say that when you live, God lives? that God is your life? that you are God&#8217;s living? that God lives in you? that for you to live is God? Paul had the boldness to say, &#8220;To me to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21). Surely it is true to say that Christ lives in you and that He is your life! This is the plain word of the Bible.<h2 class=head1>OUR NATURAL THOUGHT</h2><p>When we study the Bible, however, instead of seeing this plain word, we see only verses like this: &#8220;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might&#8221; (Deut. 6:5). We see that God is to be worshipped and feared. We see that we must labor for Him and that we must pay the price to live for Him. Words like these stand out to us when we find them in the Scripture, because we already have such concepts within us naturally. We take from the Bible what is already in our thought, rather than open to take the Word itself into us.<p>When a wife reads Ephesians, for example, she does not learn much about the church, or Christ, or the Spirit, or life. The only verse she takes note of is Ephesians 5:25. Because she is already preoccupied with the thought that her husband has to love her, she thinks the Bible is a wonderful book because of this one verse it contains! The husband, on his part, finds Ephesians 5:22, &#8220;Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.&#8221; This is the only verse that stands out to him!<p>The important things in the Bible pass us by, because they are not in our natural thought. &#8220;To me to live is Christ&#8221; does not attract much attention. Matters concerning the spirit, though we may have heard many messages on the topic, simply go in one ear and out the other. They mean very little to us. We go on in our natural way, trying to behave properly and please God, figuring that this was what the message was about anyway.<h2 class=head1>MAN&#8217;S SPIRIT</h2><p>I beg you to notice how important the human spirit is! The eternal God one day created man. Zechariah 12:1 says of Him that He &#8220;stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.&#8221; The spirit within man is small, but the Bible ranks it with the heavens and the earth. The three most significant things in God&#8217;s creation are the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man. This man has a spirit in order that he may receive God. Without the spirit, the heavens and the earth are meaningless. Have you ever praised God that you have a spirit, a spirit which is as significant as the heavens and the earth?<h2 class=head1>TWO SPIRITS JOINED</h2><p>At the time of the creation, however, God could not enter into man&#8217;s spirit. God first had to become flesh, live as a man on this earth, and then go to the cross. In His death He redeemed us from our sins and terminated the old creation. He died, was buried, and arose from the dead. In incarnation He had become flesh; now in resurrection He, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). As such, He can be joined with our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). When we turned to Him in repentance, sought His forgiveness, and opened to receive Him, He came into our spirit. We were regenerated. &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221; (John 3:6). We have a spirit which has been born of this Spirit, who is also called &#8220;the Spirit of life&#8221; (Rom. 8:2).<p>When He enters into us, He imparts life. This life is God&#8217;s own life, eternal and uncreated, a life of death and resurrection. Let us focus all our attention on this life. We must turn away from the fringes and come back to the center, to this all-inclusive Spirit, who supplies life to us. We are off center when our concern is how to worship God, how to love or submit to our spouse, how to be an overcomer, or how to live a spiritual life.<h2 class=head1>RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</h2><p>How is this life supplied to us? To help our understanding, the Bible uses physical things to symbolize what is spiritual. Eating and drinking symbolize our receiving the Spirit. The Lord said, &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&#8221; (John 7:37-38). The next verse explains that He was speaking about the Spirit, &#8220;Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive.&#8221; To receive the Spirit is like drinking water.<p>To enjoy the Spirit is like eating food. When we eat properly, our body is nourished and we have the energy to carry on. Even without understanding how it happens, we know that the food we eat somehow is digested and assimilated and supplies us with strength. The spiritual nourishment that we take in does the same thing for our spirit (John 6:57, 63).<h2 class=head1>THE RICHES IN THE SPIRIT</h2><p>How rich is this Spirit we have received! There is both the element of God and the element of man. When Jesus lived on this earth, His humanity was of the highest quality. His character was without flaw. This humanity, in passing through death and resurrection, became yet more uplifted. Now in the Spirit there is this uplifted human nature as well as the divine nature. There is also the power of endurance. All His earthly life the Lord suffered persecution, yet He endured. Now this endurance is in the Spirit. Here also is the power of crucifixion. The death of Jesus Christ terminated sin and Satan. It bruised the Devil&#8217;s head. It overcame the gates of Hades. It meant the end of the world and the end of Satan&#8217;s kingdom. Everything of the old creation was terminated in that death, which is now in the Spirit. Resurrection is also included in the Spirit, along with the power of resurrection, its life, its fragrance, and its riches. Here also are ascension, glorification, enthronement, dominion, lordship, and headship.<p>What we think of as life is poor. Consider how rich is this life spoken of in the Bible. The Spirit of life gives us life (2 Cor. 3:6b), a life which includes all we have mentioned and more. As we fellowship with the Lord, the Spirit operates in us spontaneously and causes us to experience all these elements. We can sense the element of God within us. When we are at prayer and in fellowship with the Lord, we feel that there is something within us that exceeds man&#8217;s measure. We sense that somehow we surpass others, including the angels!<h2 class=head2>An Uplifted Humanity</h2><p>Every saved one has experienced this sense at one time or other. If you think back, you will remember some occasion when you prayed and prayed until you reached holy ground. You felt you were greater than the president, higher than any earthly king. You were experiencing the divine nature, God in you. Such prayer affects your thinking. It clarifies your mind. Beforehand, you were foolish and confused, unable to differentiate between up and down. You could not figure out where you were headed. But that time when you prayed through, your thinking became clear. Your will and your emotions also came into line. Your stubborn insistence gave way, yet you did not become a jellyfish with no backbone. Your will was firm, but the willfulness was gone. Your emotions, usually so varying and unreliable, became steady. There was no more the irrational love toward what should not be loved, nor the groundless dislike of what should be appealing. Your whole character was uplifted with your mind clear, your will firm, and your emotions proper. Can you not recall having had such an experience?<p>Teenage girls spend much of their time daydreaming. They often have a hard time concentrating. Sometimes they are stubborn, but other times they are easily swayed. They can cry with little or no provocation. When they spend time to pray adequately, however, they are filled with the Spirit. Then the humanity they exhibit is of the highest caliber. They are able to give their attention to what needs to be done, their will becomes resolute, and their emotions are stable. If they have not had such an experience, their praying has not been thorough enough. When they succeed in praying through, they will find that in them there is not only God but also the proper humanity.<p>Consider the kind of person you were before you were saved. You lived in your imaginations, letting your thoughts wander at will. When something favorable happened to you, you were so happy you could not sleep. When a hardship came your way, you were so miserable you wanted to die. When you got mad, your rage knew no bounds. You were like someone playing the piano, but playing only the high notes!<p>Now that you are saved, you are not the same. When you pray earnestly and thoroughly until you touch God, you find an uplifted humanity within you. Your thoughts no longer zoom from the heights of the heavens to the depths of the seas. When you are happy, there is moderation in your joy. Even when you weep, there is a limit which you do not exceed. You may still lose your temper, but there is a restraint which keeps you from going too far. As you remain in fellowship with the Lord, your piano playing produces lovely music. When the notes should be high, they are high. When they should be low and soft, you play accordingly. The wildness and the imbalance are no longer heard.<p>The humanity of Jesus has stabilized you. Jesus of Nazareth had the highest humanity. After He passed through death and resurrection, the element of His humanity entered into the Spirit. This is the very Spirit that came into you when you received the Lord. His character is now your character. In the indwelling Spirit there is humanity as well as divinity. By Him you become a proper man.<p>One who is filled with the Spirit can be firm and strong, even to the point of martyrdom. The threat of death does not terrify him. His will can be more steadfast than the mountains. However much stress he encounters, his inner supply is not exhausted. This is the humanity of Jesus Christ, experienced and expressed when one is filled with the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>Death with Christ</h2><p>When I was a young Christian, I loved the Lord. I tried hard to overcome my shortcomings. From reading certain spiritual books, I learned that I had been crucified with Christ, and that this was the key to my being victorious over my weaknesses. My little mind, however, could not figure out how I could have been crucified with Him, when He died in Israel and I was in China thousands of miles away! And how could I have died with Him when I was not born until two thousand years later?! How could there be a relationship of any kind between His death and mine?<p>In my reading I eventually came across a book saying that we must reckon ourselves dead, as Romans 6 teaches. This seemed logical to me. Since two and two are four, I reckon on that fact when I do calculations. A message I heard also encouraged me to reckon. The Chinese are all supposedly the descendants of Huang Ti. If someone had killed him before he had any sons, the Chinese would all have died in him. By the same principle, the preacher said, we could reckon that when Christ died, we died.<p>Impressed with this logic, I began to reckon. I also taught others to reckon. What I discovered was that before I started reckoning, my evil self was dormant. Whenever I reckoned, it became active. The more I reckoned it dead, the more alive it was. No doubt many of you have also gone through this experience of trying to reckon yourself dead and finding it does not work.<p>Before 1937 Brother Nee also preached this message of reckoning to us. He had A. B. Simpson&#8217;s hymn, &#8220;Let us reckon, reckon, reckon&#8221; (Hymns, #692), included in our Chinese hymnal. After 1937, however, Brother Nee saw something further regarding Romans 6. He told us that this chapter declares the fact, but that it cannot be the experience. Only when we go on to Romans 8, he said, could we experience what it is to die with Christ. Death with Christ can only be experienced in the Spirit. I surely said amen when I heard that.<p>When we are filled with the Spirit, the effectiveness of the death of Christ is our experience. If we keep praying until we are in the Spirit, we shall find the killing. There is no need to reckon. We have all experienced that when we are filled with the Spirit, our bad temper, our wrong attitude, our feeling of jealousy, and our opinions are all killed.<p>This effective praying is the way to take nourishment into us. Just as eating the proper food helps destroy the germs in our body that make us ill, so when we are filled with the Spirit, the effectiveness of the death of Christ kills all the negative things in us.<h2 class=head2>Resurrection</h2><p>In the Spirit is also the power of resurrection. When you pray until you are filled by the Spirit, you will sense that you are free and in the ascendancy. Oppression will be gone. Life and the power of life will comfort and heal you, bringing you into peace and quietness. Sometimes you will even feel that you are soaring in the heavens, far above all. Others may quarrel and be dissenting, but you are in resurrection. As you further pray, you will find that Satan and all the demons are under your feet.<h2 class=head2>Other Riches</h2><p>As you pray and are filled with the Spirit, you will sense that all authority is yours. You will be reigning in life. Then there will be the kingdom. Simultaneously, overcoming, sanctification, and spirituality are also yours.<h2 class=head1>OURS THROUGH PRAYER</h2><p>To enjoy all these riches in the Spirit, spend time before the Lord. Pray with your spirit, opening your whole being to Him. Praise Him, behold Him, fellowship with Him, and let Him fill you. Pray whatever He leads you to pray; do not exert your mind. If He leads you to confess, confess. If He leads you to repent, repent. If He leads you to weep, weep. If He leads you to be joyful, be joyful. Simply pray according to His leading. Then you will be filled with the Spirit, and He will be your constant supply. Practice this all the time, every day.<p>Confucius taught that there is a bright virtue within us. He no doubt meant the conscience. His teaching was that through great learning we could develop this virtue and thus attain the ultimate goodness. In man&#8217;s concept this may be a noble idea. This is not, however, what we are doing. The conscience is only a third of our spirit. We want to have our entire spirit filled with the Spirit. Rather than developing the bright virtue, we are having the Spirit added into our spirit. How marvelous this is! Our spirit and the Spirit become one. How much higher it is to have this rich Spirit within our spirit! How much more this does for us than the great learning to develop the bright virtue! We are in graduate school! The great learning is only kindergarten!<p>How blessed we are! The bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit is our portion. May we all keep turning to our spirit and let our natural concepts go. Then the Spirit will supply us day by day. As we taste His riches, we shall enjoy Christ as our life and we shall be His living. Then we can say, &#8220;Christ lives in me! For me to live is Christ!&#8221;<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD&#8217;S LAMPSTAND AND HIS LAMPS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:31a, 37a; Zech. 4:2; Rev. 1:12b, 20b; Prov. 20:27; Rev. 4:5b; 1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:4, 6; Eph. 6:18; 1 Thes. 5:17, 19</h1><h2 class=head1>A SYMBOL OF GOD&#8217;S TESTIMONY</h2><p>The testimony of God is that He enters into man to be man&#8217;s life and even his disposition. God in us is our life, while we outwardly are God&#8217;s living.<p>Because spiritual matters like this are abstract, the Bible uses symbols to portray them. The lampstand in the tabernacle symbolizes the testimony of God. Exodus 25:31-37 gives us a description of how it was to be made. Only one lampstand was to be made, and it was to be entirely of gold. This one lampstand, however, was to have seven lamps. Looked at from the bottom, the lampstand is one. From the top, however, it appears to be seven because of the seven lamps.<p>The meaning of this lampstand is rich and profound. It symbolizes the very Triune God.<h2 class=head1>GOLDEN IN NATURE</h2><p>Gold typifies the divine nature. The substance of this lampstand remains constant and unchanged, for gold does not rust or tarnish. The pure gold of the lampstand, then, typifies God&#8217;s nature, which is simply God Himself.<h2 class=head1>A LAMPSTAND IN FORM</h2><p>This pure gold is not shapeless. It has a form, which denotes its function. A table, for example, has a form which speaks of its use; we can use it to write on or to eat from. If it had a different shape, it would not serve the same purpose. In what form is this lampstand? This form is the second Person of the Godhead, the Son. &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#8221; (John 1:18). The Son is the form or manifestation of the Father.<p>How can this lampstand represent the form of God, who is invisible and has no form? Second Corinthians 4:4 tells us clearly that Christ is the image of God. God created man in His own image (Gen. 1:27). Colossians 1:15 describes Christ as &#8220;the image of the invisible God.&#8221; It is certainly true to say, then, that God has His image.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT IN EXPRESSION</h2><p>The seven lamps of the lampstand signify the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 4:5). This is a reference to the Third of the Trinity, for the seven Spirits are simply the Spirit of God. The shining of the Spirit is God expressed.<p>The lampstand, then, portrays God in His substance (the Father), embodiment (the Son), and expression (the Spirit).<p>This lampstand, representing the Triune God, is His testimony. Because the church is His testimony, it also is the golden lampstand (Rev. 1:20). It is common to think of the church as a religious gathering, but this is a most inadequate way to regard it. To consider the church as a group of sinners, saved and cleansed by the blood, and then meeting together, is also too low a concept. Yes, we are an assembly in the sense that we do come together for meetings. But in reality the church is a lampstand.<h2 class=head1>THE SHAPING OF THE LAMPSTAND</h2><h2 class=head2>Gold Added to Us</h2><p>How did this lampstand come about? We have not only been cleansed by the precious blood; we have also been regenerated. This new birth implies that there is another life and therefore a father is involved. Because we have been born again, we have a life which has its source in the Father. Outwardly we have been cleansed; inwardly we have been regenerated. Now God is our Father. It follows naturally that we have His nature, just as every son bears his father&#8217;s nature. John 1:11-12 says that those who receive Christ are born of God. We are called &#8220;partakers of the divine nature&#8221; in 2 Peter 1:4. Pure gold has come into us!<h2 class=head2>From Clay to Gold</h2><p>By our first birth we are men of clay, formed of the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7). &#8220;The first man is of the earth, earthy&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:47). When we die, we return to the dust. &#8220;Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return&#8221; (Gen. 3:19).<p>Before we were regenerated, we were men of clay. One day, however, we got saved, and God came into us. Now, instead of being men of clay, we are men of gold!<p>Look at yourself. There is gold in you! Because God is your Father, you have His substance and nature. But do you have the form of the Son? To have the shape of the Son means that there has been some transformation in you. &#8220;But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:18, Gk.). How much of the Lord&#8217;s image do you have? This depends on the amount of transformation you have experienced. Yes, you have gold within, but it is surrounded by the clay and has not yet taken shape. In your living, does the clay come out or the gold?<h2 class=head2>The Need for Christ to Be Formed in Us</h2><p>We are in the church. The church, however, is a golden lampstand. It is not made of clay. Since we are part gold and part clay, we are partly the church and partly not the church. We are in the process. The golden lampstand is buried in the clay! Christ is yet to be formed in us (Gal. 4:19). He has been revealed in us (1:16) and lives in us (2:20). Now the gold within needs to take shape. We know there is something shiny and weighty inside us; this substance must be formed into the lampstand. Because of this gold, we hesitate to say that we are not the lampstand. Yet there is so much clay still clinging to us that we wonder if we can be considered the lampstand. When we are in this mixed condition, can we call ourselves the church?<p>The church is the practical expression of the Triune God. The Father enters into man to be his nature. The Son is in man transforming him to be the form. Then the Spirit in man expresses God. Thus the church is depicted as a golden lampstand (Rev. 1:20b).<h2 class=head1>THE LAMPSTAND IN EXODUS, ZECHARIAH, AND REVELATION</h2><p>There are three phases to the golden lampstand. The first is in Exodus in the tabernacle, where it represents the Triune God (Exo. 25:31-37). The second is in Zechariah, where it represents the children of Israel who are in the position of receiving grace (Zech. 4:2). Those who thus receive grace, before God are His testimony. The last is in the New Testament, where the golden lampstand is the church (Rev. 1:12, 20). This testimony declares that the substance of the Father has been wrought into the believers; the shape of the Son has also been constituted into them; and the expression of the Spirit is realized through them.<h2 class=head1>THE SEARCHING LAMP</h2><p>How will the gold in us take shape? There is no question regarding our having the gold within us. Our question concerns transformation, not regeneration. How can we be transformed into His image from glory to glory?<p>The answer lies with the Spirit. The church as the lampstand has seven lamps, which are God&#8217;s seven Spirits. God is Spirit (John 4:24). More than this, we are told in Proverbs 20:27, &#8220;The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord&#8221; (Heb.). Within us, then, we have two lamps, the Spirit of God and our human spirit. Inside our little lamp is a stronger lamp. Before we were saved, our spirit was a broken lamp. After we repented, the lamp was restored and began to give forth light. Day by day as we prayed, the shining increased. With regeneration this lamp also had another lamp come into it. This was the Spirit of God. It is because of these two lamps that there is so much shining within us. The two become one, for &#8220;he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:17).<p>Man&#8217;s spirit, Proverbs 20:27 goes on to say, searches all his inward parts, or, as Darby&#8217;s footnote says, &#8220;all the chambers of the soul.&#8221; In your soul are various chambers, or rooms. The spirit is searching the chamber of your emotions, and of your mind, and of your will.<p>Though we all have the pure gold in us, the inward parts of our soul may not be open. When we pray, we are afraid to open our emotion, for example, to the Lord. After we reach a certain point in our praying, we close up because we are unwilling to open some inner chamber to Him. We may faithfully attend all the meetings, read the Word, and spend time in prayer. Yet there is a door within that is locked. We are aware of this, yet we tell the Lord that there is no way to open that door, even though we love Him and have paid a price in other ways.<p>The sisters&#8217; way of getting around such a problem is to shed tears. Because they have learned to win out by crying, they try this same tactic on the Lord. The brothers, on their part, react with stubbornness. &#8220;No, Lord. I cannot open that part to You. You just have to forgive me.&#8221; Whatever way we try, we cannot subdue the Lord. He will not force us, however. He will wait. Meantime, in that chamber of our soul we are not being transformed to His image.<h2 class=head1>OPENING THE INNER CHAMBERS</h2><p>To have our spirit regenerated is simple. We confess our sins and receive the Lord. Then we have the Spirit of God within. To be transformed in our soul, however, is not easy. It needs the lamp of the Lord to search all the inner chambers. There are very few who have opened all their inner chambers to Him.<p>You may love the Lord, and you may pray regularly for your children and your grandchildren. Yet in your soul are two chambers that you reserve for yourself. You keep the Lord locked out of there.<p>Many Christians are unaware that they have a spirit. They live in the soul. Without the spirit, however, the soul is dark. It needs the lamp of the Lord. A lamp is for use in darkness. Because man has fallen, he is in darkness. Thus he is corrupt. Because the spirit has lost its function, he has no light. He must repent, that is, turn his being to his spirit.<p>Before you heard the gospel, you did all kinds of evil things. You utterly neglected your spirit, and fully gave yourself to satisfy your soul. You lived according to your emotion, mind, and will. When you heeded the call to repent, however, you turned and experienced the light shining in the spirit. You were saved and regenerated.<p>Now that you are saved, how are you living? Do you pay attention to your spirit or still live according to the soul? The only way to have light is to walk according to spirit (Rom. 8:4). That light searches the inward parts of your soul. If you are not in your spirit, you cannot see your true condition. You quarrel with others, certain that you are in the right and unaware that you are in darkness.<h2 class=head1>LIGHT AND LIFE</h2><p>It is through prayer that you can be turned to your spirit. When you pray, you pray yourself into the spirit. Your quarreling leaves you in darkness, but after some time you calm down and begin to pray a little. Then comes the shining. You see how wrong your arguing was. You realize that your thought was wrong, that you had a poor attitude, and that what you said should not have been said. The more you pray, the more you are in your spirit, where the light shines.<p>Both the spirit of man and the Spirit of God are lamps, shining and enlightening our inward parts. As our spirit shines, the Spirit of God intensifies the shining sevenfold, till we find we have no place to hide.<p>Where this light shines, there the life supply goes. Little by little, chamber by chamber, we are transformed into the Lord&#8217;s image. The gold in us takes shape. Christ is formed in us. For us to live is Christ. In all of us this shining, supplying, and transforming is going on, making us the golden lampstand. Then we are truly the church, the practical expression of God, and His testimony. The Father is in us, the Son has taken form, and the Spirit expresses this reality.<h2 class=head1>BY MEANS OF ALL PRAYER</h2><p>We can liken this golden lampstand to a complicated piece of machinery. Without a certain small screw, the machinery will not operate. The screw for this golden lampstand is that we must be in our spirit! Prayer is the key to our being able to stay in spirit. &#8220;By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition&#8221; (Eph. 6:18). &#8220;Pray without ceasing&#8221; (1 Thes. 5:17), because as soon as we stop praying, we leave our spirit. All around are things to distract us. We must keep our eyes shut and be in prayer!<p>Sometimes we have to go shopping. If we really have a need to buy something, when we go into the department store, we must pay no attention to all the alluring things on display. It takes an effort, but we must stay in prayer so that we buy only what we came for. God keeps calling us back to our spirit.<p>I remember in 1933 when I lived in Shanghai, I had to go from one end of town to the other for a meeting. In those days it was an hour&#8217;s ride by electric car. The streets were bustling with activity, and gaudy signs tried to catch the eye. Before I left, I spent time praying for the meeting that night. However, by the time I reached the meeting hall after that car ride, the spirit was gone. It was shaken off because of all the distracting things to be seen. I learned a lesson from that experience. Afterwards, whenever I took the electric car, I would sit there with my eyes closed, praying, refusing to be enticed by the scenes outside. Then when my ride was over, I would still be conscious of the spirit with me. When I went into the meetings, the spirit would come forth.<p>With so much to turn you away, it is not easy to remain in spirit. That is why you must heed this exhortation to pray at every time in spirit. Pray with all prayer and petition! Watch unto this in all perseverance! &#8220;Quench not the Spirit&#8221; (1 Thes. 5:19)! Walk according to spirit! Set your mind on the spirit (Rom. 8:6)!<p>Then you will be kept in life. The two lamps inside you will be shining brightly. All your inner chambers will be transformed into the image of the Lord. Not only will you have the pure gold; it will take shape, and there will be the expression. The crucial point is that you must remain in, or turn back to your spirit. Then there will be a golden lampstand, the church, the practical expression of the Triune God.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE CHURCH BECOMING THE LAMPSTAND OF GOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:31a, 37a; Zech. 4:2; Rev. 1:12b, 20b; Prov. 20:27; Rev. 4:5b</h1><h2 class=head1>THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF GOD</h2><p>The main revelation of the Bible is the relationship between God and man. What this relationship should be also occupies very much of human thought. When man thinks of God, he thinks in terms of worshipping, fearing, and perhaps loving Him. God, in man&#8217;s concept, is far off in the heavens, dwelling in unapproachable majesty; the best mere man can do is to offer Him worship and try to please Him.<p>This natural concept is that man&#8217;s relationship with God is objective. Religion also promotes such a concept, whether that religion is Judaism, Christianity, or Islam. Verses from the Bible can be used to support this idea of a God to be worshipped and revered from afar.<p>If we penetrate the heart of the Bible, however, we shall see that man&#8217;s relationship with God is to be a subjective one. God wants to come into us and become our life and nature. Then He wants us to become His living. Colossians 3:4 says &#8220;Christ our life.&#8221; Galatians 2:20 says, &#8220;Christ lives in me.&#8221; Philippians 1:21 says, &#8220;To me to live is Christ.&#8221; Since Christ is God, Paul was saying that for him to live was God.<p>God is our life. We are the living of God. God lives within us. To us to live is God. These four sentences are the center of the New Testament. If they are not our daily experience, we are not up to the standard.<p>When we speak of the subjective experience of God, we are touching something hard to grasp. How can it possibly be that God becomes our life? that we become His living? that He lives within us? that for us to live is God?<h2 class=head1>A SYMBOL</h2><p>To help our understanding, the Bible uses pictures. Words alone are not so clear. It is hard to visualize a person&#8217;s looks, for example, by reading a description of him; a photograph, on the other hand, shows what the person looks like even if no words are used.<p>What Old Testament picture prefigures how the Lord Jesus shed His blood for us that God might pass over us in His judgment, and that He might become our life and be taken into us as food? As you probably all know, it is the Passover lamb in Exodus 12. What Old Testament type shows us that to be in the Lord Jesus is to be saved even through the waters of God&#8217;s judgment? Even those in the children&#8217;s meeting know that the answer is Noah&#8217;s ark.<p>Can you think of a picture that shows us that God is our life, that we are the living of God, that He lives within us, and that for us to live is God? There is such a picture! For over fifty years, however, I did not realize that such was the meaning of this picture.<p>There is the illustration in John 15, where the Lord Jesus told us that He is the vine and we are the branches. We are to abide in Him, and He will abide in us. To some extent this picture does show us that He lives in us, and that for us to live is He. However, this picture is more like a sketch than a photograph.<p>A most comprehensive picture is the golden lampstand, which is first mentioned in Exodus 25. There it stood in the tabernacle as a testimony for God. Zechariah 4 is the second mention. There the lampstand represented the true Israelites, who were also God&#8217;s testimony. The final mention, in Revelation 1, pictures the church as the golden lampstand and as the testimony of God.<p>You may have too shallow an understanding of what God&#8217;s testimony is. Do not think that standing up to speak for God makes you His testimony; that your good works, done to glorify Him, make you His testimony; that honoring your parents, or not arguing with others, means that you have a testimony of Him. These outward things are far beneath what His testimony is.<p>God&#8217;s testimony is a golden lampstand. It means that God comes into us to be our life and to cause us to become His living. He lives within us, and we live Him out.<h2 class=head1>THE MEANING OF THE LAMPSTAND</h2><p>The design of the lampstand is most meaningful. Though the lampstand is but one, there are six branches with seven lamps. In all man&#8217;s six days (or six thousand years) of history, this design has never been improved. In the thirty-five hundred years since Moses described this pattern, no one has been able to produce a better design. The Jews often make use of drawings of this lampstand; they make minor variations in the style of it, but no one has been able to improve it. Architects vary the designs they make of buildings. Clothing fashions go back and forth from one style to another. This lampstand, however, was designed by God. What He fashions cannot be improved. Who can alter the pattern of man&#8217;s face or improve the form of his body?<p>The lampstand signifies the Triune God. In typology gold represents the divine nature. Like gold, God&#8217;s nature does not change or decay. That this lampstand was made of gold tells us that it represents God&#8217;s nature.<p>This gold was not in a formless lump. It was structured into a form that bespoke its function. The shape of the gold, a lampstand, symbolizes the image of God. Who is God&#8217;s image? Christ is called &#8220;the image of God&#8221; in 2 Corinthians 4:4. As the Son of God&#8217;s love, He is &#8220;the image of the invisible God&#8221; (Col. 1:15). The image or form of the lampstand, then, signifies Christ. &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#8221; (John 1:18).<p>What are the seven lamps? About this we cannot be clear until we come to Revelation. There we are plainly told that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 4:5). The seven Spirits are simply the Holy Spirit of God. These lamps are the expression or manifestation of God.<p>The Father, then, is signified by the gold, the element of which the lamp was made. The Son is signified by the form of the lampstand. The Spirit is the expression, as indicated by the seven lamps. Now do you agree that the golden lampstand pictures the Triune God?<p>By the time we come to Revelation, the church has become the lampstand. This means that the church is the expression of the Triune God. Each local church is a golden lampstand. What firstly signified the Triune God now depicts the church!<p>By nature, however, we are not made of gold. God formed man of the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7). When our physical body is chemically analyzed, it is found to have the same constituents as the soil. At death man returns to the dust from which he was taken (Gen. 3:19).<p>How can we, who are men of dust or clay, become a golden lampstand? When we were regenerated, we were born of God. Not only were our sins cleansed by the precious blood; there was also within us the element of the Father, just as a new baby has the life and nature of his father. Now there is gold, the element of God, in us!<h2 class=head1>THE SHAPING OF THE GOLD</h2><p>Nonetheless, this gold needs to be formed. Paul travailed for the Galatians &#8220;until Christ is formed in you&#8221; (Gal. 4:19). It was not enough for Christ to be revealed in them (Gal. 1:16) or even to be living in them (Gal. 2:20). The gold had to take shape.<p>Before the gold within us takes shape, can we say that we are the church? According to locality we are surely the church. How else could we describe ourselves? Yet according to what we are, we may not look like the church.<p>Even this morning you may have been quarreling at home. When you recall that, you find it hard to declare that you are the church. Nevertheless, in the midst of this quarreling by the man of clay, there was still gold within you.<p>We are truly the church. In spite of our appearance of clay outside, inside is the element of gold.<h2 class=head1>TRANSFORMED BY THE SHINING OF THE LAMPS</h2><p>Our need now is transformation. &#8220;But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:18, Gk.). To be transformed into the Lord&#8217;s image is from the Lord Spirit. The final expression of the golden lampstand is the seven lamps, which are the seven Spirits of God.<p>Our own spirit is also the lamp of God (Prov. 20:27). These two spirits, ours and God&#8217;s, have been mingled. Within our little lamp there is now also another lamp of greater intensity.<p>The function of a lamp is to shine. According to J. N. Darby&#8217;s footnote, Proverbs 20:27 can be rendered, &#8220;Man&#8217;s spirit is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all the chambers of the soul.&#8221; Before we were saved, our spirit was dead; the light of the lamp was extinguished. All our movements were under the direction of the soul. Our thinking and our doing were according to our whims. One day, however, the light of the gospel shined into us, and the lamp of greater intensity was placed in us. The spirit&#8217;s function revived. We repented and confessed our sins, enlightened by the conscience within our spirit. With our spirit enlivened, and the lamp of God&#8217;s Spirit added to our spirit, it became very bright within.<p>The light now searches all the inward parts of the soul. Under its twofold shining, we can see that the thoughts we were so sure of are wrong; that we loved what we should hate, and hated what we should love; that our joys and sorrows were for the wrong things; and that our intentions and decisions were wrong. Under the intensity of this light, we confess and repent to the Lord.<h2 class=head1>RESISTING THE LIGHT</h2><p>Usually, however, there are some areas within us that resist the penetration of the light. When the Lord shines on some aspect of our emotions, the sisters may weep before Him, but they will not open this door to His searching gaze. When the Lord shines on our dislike for a certain brother, the brothers may argue and protest, but they stubbornly shut the door of their will to the Lord&#8217;s reproach. We may admit to the Lord our shortcomings, but we tell Him that He must forgive us, that our weakness is to blame, that such is the way He made us, or that others are at fault. Why does He not change the others? Why does He always pick on us?<p>When you close the door to the Lord in this way, you cannot be transformed. Year after year you read the Bible, pray, and go to the meetings. But you refuse to change your old ways. You will not allow the Lord to touch your feelings, your thoughts, or your possessions. You may pray, but what matters is what you say, not what God says. You may shed tears before the Lord, but you will not open the door of your emotions to Him.<p>If you allow this blockage to continue, the enlightenment will cease. You may still faithfully read your Bible. You may find it easy to pray. You may keep attending the meetings regularly. The tendency to cry may be gone. Outwardly you seem to be at peace. Inwardly, however, your growth has been arrested. God&#8217;s way of transforming is through enlightening. Wherever the light shines, life is supplied to that place. By rejecting the light, you are rejecting the supply of life.<h2 class=head1>OPENING TO THE LORD</h2><p>Who experiences the greatest amount of transformation? It is the one who is absolutely open to the Lord.<p>&#8220;Lord, I am fully open to You. I want to keep opening to You. My whole being is open-my heart, my mind, my will, and my emotions. Keep shining. Search me thoroughly. Enlighten and enliven me. I will accept it fully.&#8221; In this way, the light will penetrate into every area, and life simultaneously will be supplied to you. The man of clay will be transformed into the image of Christ. As the gold is thus formed in you, there will be the seven Spirits shining forth and manifesting God.<p>Such is the church in reality. The golden lampstand is not only the Triune God; it also is the church, His manifestation. That the church may express the Triune God is what He is working to accomplish on earth.<p>May we all be open to Him to receive His enlightening and to let His life supply us. Then we shall be transformed and bear the image of Christ. As we are enlightened by the lamps within us, we shall become the golden lampstand in reality in our locality, manifesting the Triune God. Then He will have His testimony.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTY</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT-GOD&#8217;S ULTIMATE EXPRESSION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Zech. 3:9; 4:2, 6, 10a; Rev. 1:4, 20b; 4:5b; 5:6; 22:17a</h1><h2 class=head1>SEVEN GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS</h2><p>The last book of the Bible opens with a vision of seven golden lampstands. As we are told, the lampstands are seven churches (Rev. 1:20).<p>Why is the church a golden lampstand? Very few see this mystery. As we said in previous messages, the golden lampstand firstly symbolizes the Triune God. It speaks of His nature, form, and expression. The Father is the nature, the Son is the image, and the Spirit is the expression. For the church to be represented by this very same symbol indicates that the church is the expression of the Triune God. Ultimately the church is one with God.<p>From the standpoint of experience, how does the Triune God come into us and then become the church? Since our regeneration, we have had the nature of God, the pure gold, inside us. But for this gold to take the shape of the lampstand requires that we be transformed.<h2 class=head1>TRANSFORMED, NOT REFORMED</h2><p>I am not talking about being reformed. Transformation is a matter of life. It involves a metabolic change. A mortician has to apply artificial coloring to the face of a dead person in order to disguise the pallor of the lips and the skin. The corpse lies in his coffin, still lifeless, but his appearance is much improved. The best reformation can do is to superficially change the outward appearance.<p>Transformation, in contrast, produces change from within. If you are sickly and pallid, you need to begin eating properly and getting enough fresh air and exercise. After a time the proper diet and exercise will cause a metabolic change in your appearance. Without any false color being added to your skin, your complexion will be vibrant with good health.<p>The Scripture speaks of being transformed in 2 Corinthians 3:18: &#8220;But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&#8221; (Gk.). Romans 12:2 also tells us not to be &#8220;conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&#8221; Transformation refers to a metabolic change brought about by another element being added to us and becoming part of us.<p>Without this additional element, which is God Himself, we cannot be transformed. The best we can hope for is an improved appearance, while we still remain our old self. God has no interest in improving us outwardly. His economy is first to regenerate us by adding His very nature to us. This higher element then begins to uplift our original element and gradually eliminates the negative things of that original condition.<h2 class=head1>THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>When the Holy Spirit comes into man, He brings with Him the element of divinity. This element effects a change in man. This change is usually called the work of the Spirit. He is not merely reforming man. As those who have studied chemistry know, there cannot be a chemical reaction without a new element being added, no matter how much effort is made to uplift the original constituents.<p>It is pitiful that so many Christians regard the work of the Spirit as a work of reformation. They ask God for His Spirit to help them to be more loving and to fulfill their duties. They consider themselves as poor and weak, in need of the power of the Holy Spirit to strengthen them. The thought of God as the all-powerful One, answering the prayers of poor, frail human beings by strengthening them to meet their obligations, is a natural religious concept.<p>Such a concept is not the revelation of the Bible. When the Holy Spirit comes, He brings God into you. God Himself becomes the source within you. He becomes your life, bringing about a subjective, organic change. He is not helping you in an external way. The end result is that you become God-men, not good men! You are not merely full of virtues, but full of God! You are not here to express virtues, but to express God.<p>We were born men of clay. When the Holy Spirit comes, He begins to change us into men of gold. He also shapes the gold within us until it is in the form of a lampstand. This lampstand is the church.<h2 class=head1>THE WAY OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION</h2><p>Perhaps you do not grasp what I mean. Let us take as an example a young sister, saved two or three years ago. Because her family has indulged her, she is selfish and bad-tempered. After being saved, she begins to feel that she must stop behaving so inconsiderately of others. She prays, &#8220;Lord, keep me from losing my temper. Don&#8217;t let me act in such a spoiled way.&#8221; Usually her prayer is not answered. Occasionally, however it seems to work.<p>Let me assure you that, if such a prayer is answered, it is answered only temporarily. To pray this way is wrong. God is not trying to reform us so that we are better behaved. He wants to add Himself to us and be our life. He wants to be our very substance, just as the food we take in becomes part of us. We do not gain strength by having a cow help us! Our energy does not come from riding on a bull! The animal must be slaughtered and some of it must be eaten by us. Within a few hours the beef we have eaten is assimilated, and we find that we are strengthened to carry on. It is not the strength of the cow which is sustaining us. Rather, the element of the cow has come into our blood. It has become part of us.<p>Such an illustration of the food we eat is to point us to Christ. We are not imitating Him or asking for His help. Rather, we take Him in daily. As we digest and assimilate Him, we are changed into His image.<p>If this young sister we have mentioned feeds upon Christ daily and opens to let Him be her life element, gradually and spontaneously her ugly manner will disappear, as the new element is metabolically added to her. This is what transformation is. This is the way of God&#8217;s salvation.<p>Transformation is the work of the Holy Spirit. To listen to preaching is not sufficient. The word of the preaching brings the Spirit to you. With the Spirit comes God. By His coming into you, you will have such a change. The outcome of this transformation is the golden lampstand.<h2 class=head1>A PROGRESSIVE REVELATION</h2><p>In Genesis 1:1 it says, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&#8221; In chapter two it says, &#8220;Jehovah God made the earth and the heavens&#8221; (v. 4). Here are two different names for one Person. Other names for God are introduced as the Bible continues, but we shall skip over to the Gospel of Matthew. Here it says, &#8220;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ&#8221; (Matt. 1:1). Do you think Jesus Christ and Jehovah are two separate Persons? No! The revelation in the Bible is progressive. First there is mention of God, then Jehovah, and then Jesus Christ.<p>The revelation continues. In Acts 2:2-4 the Holy Spirit came and filled all the disciples gathered together. In the Epistles we read, &#8220;Now the Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17). Then, in the final book, there are seven churches and seven Spirits before His throne (Rev. 1:4). These seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne (4:5). The seven lamps, in turn, are the seven eyes of the Lamb (5:6). Then in the last chapter &#8220;the Spirit and the bride say, Come!&#8221; (22:17).<p>Now you have had a survey of the whole Bible! In Genesis God is introduced, but in Revelation there are the Spirit and the Bride. These are not different Persons. In the beginning He was God. Then the name Jehovah comes in. After that He became Jesus Christ. Then He became the Spirit. Ultimately He is the Spirit and the Bride. The Spirit is the ultimate expression of God.<p>In your daily fellowship with God, who is the God that you contact? Is it the God in Genesis 1 or the Spirit in Revelation 22? Today the God you experience is the Spirit. The God in Genesis 1 was far away in the heavens. Now He is the Spirit within you and is one with the Bride.<p>How did God after incarnation become the Spirit? After living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, He went to the cross and there redeemed us from our sins and terminated the old creation. He was buried and after three days arose from the dead. In resurrection the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The last Adam is the man Jesus, God become flesh. In resurrection He took the second step, by which He became the Spirit.<p>God, then, after incarnation became the Spirit, by passing through death and resurrection. Besides being the Spirit, He is also the seven Spirits (Rev. 4:5); that is to say, He has been intensified sevenfold. This is the Spirit who is within us. This is the God who is within us.<p>Are you in Genesis? in Matthew? or in Revelation? I would surely answer that I am in the book of Revelation. I would not like to stay in Romans or even in Ephesians. I am in Revelation! I am part of the golden lampstand! I am enjoying the seven Spirits, the seven lamps, and the seven eyes (Rev. 5:6)!<h2 class=head1>THE POSSESSING SPIRIT</h2><p>How do we who are men of clay become men of gold? As we pray, repent, and confess to the Lord, the Spirit, this intensified Spirit, fills us. If we do not pray, or if we do not open to repent and confess our sins when we pray, there is no way for us to be thus transformed. The more we open in our praying, the more we shall be filled with this sevenfold Spirit.<p>This Spirit is like a lamp, shining in us. He ruthlessly exposes us. Because we do not fully open to Him, however, His work is not accomplished all at once. As we open a little, He comes in. The next day we may open the door to another room, but just a small crack. The Lord will put His foot in, and we tell Him that is enough. Then His shoulder may follow. Sometimes we argue with Him. Sometimes He argues with us. Sometimes He simply stays there knocking on one of the doors. Eventually we cannot help but open to Him. We are not all that pleased for Him to be there, because we no longer feel as comfortable in that room as we did before He came in. Little by little, as we pray and confess, the Lord goes from room to room. For some the time is longer, for others shorter, but it takes a few years. Even then we are not entirely possessed by Him.<p>We who are saved and love the Lord must be fully occupied by Him. The Lord will not become impatient. To Him a thousand years are like a day. If we refuse to let Him in today, He will try again tomorrow. If He cannot gain an entrance this year, He will be back again next year. Even if we hold out for this age, in the next age He will come again. Sooner or later He will occupy us fully. Years ago I decided I would like to have this matter settled quickly. It is pointless to bargain with Him. I told Him to take over as fast as He could. Nonetheless, it is God&#8217;s way to occupy us little by little.<p>The Lord may come to enlighten you. After two or three weeks you decide you have had enough. You quit. No more praying. No more meetings. That&#8217;s the end. But after a few weeks you begin to think of the Lord again. You find yourself talking to Him. You find yourself going to a meeting. As you sit there, inside you the tears begin to flow. Afterwards, when you get home, you kneel by your bed and pour out your heart to Him.<p>What makes you have an experience like that? Why should you suffer that kind of torment? What folly! What is this mysterious constraint within you? It is inexplicable, yet somehow you have been restored to the Lord. You attend the Lord&#8217;s table meeting and enjoy its sweetness. A few days pass by, and you find the Lord again knocking at the door of that very room you will not open. You answer, &#8220;Lord! Here You are again! You had better forget about this room.&#8221; Such is our story.<p>I can describe these experiences to you, because I have passed along this road. Over the course of fifty years, one after another the rooms have been given to the Lord. This is the Lord&#8217;s work within us as the sevenfold Spirit. He daily enlightens us and exposes our weaknesses. Even unintentionally and unwillingly we find ourselves confessing to Him.<p>Once a weakness is touched by the Lord, it is no longer the same. After Jacob&#8217;s thigh was touched by the Lord, he walked with a limp (Gen. 32:24-31). You used to go into a violent rage when you got angry. Now you may still lose your temper, but it has lost its vigor! Your temper is crippled. You want to flare up, but the fire will not come! Because your temper has been touched by the Lord, your rage can no longer go out of bounds.<p>The same thing befalls your idle talk. You would go from house to house, talking about whether Sister So-and-so was pregnant, whether Brother So-and-so was engaged, and whether that family came from East or West Malaysia. There came a time when you prayed, however, and the seven lamps shined. Why were you such a busybody? Why not preach the gospel instead of gossiping? The reproaching of those seven Spirits shining within crippled your idle talk. The next time you visit your sister-in-law, your tongue is silent. You can only ask how she is. When she begins to tell you the latest news about the neighbors, you have a sinking feeling inside. She asks what is wrong, and you do not know what to say. Your gossiping tongue has been crippled.<p>One after another our weaknesses are touched until they are lame. The Lord still shines until in time our weaknesses are gone.<h2 class=head1>TRANSFUSED BY THE SEVEN EYES</h2><p>These seven Spirits are also the seven eyes. Eyes speak of transfusion and transmission. As we look at someone, we infuse what we are into him. When we are in prayer, we sometimes sense the Lord&#8217;s eyes upon us. He is infusing us with Himself, changing what we are by adding His substance to us. After our time of prayer we are not the same as before. Not only has His light shined on us; He has also transfused His element into us. We have had an &#8220;injection&#8221; of the divine life. Day by day it increases and is added to.<p>Without your realizing it, you are being transformed. Not only is there gold within you; you are becoming pure gold. The gold is taking the form of the stature of Christ. Then when you meet together, you are a golden lampstand. The Holy Spirit is released and able to shine forth.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE</h2><p>Now you can see why the seven Spirits are not only the ultimate expression of God but also the ultimate expression of the church. If a lamp has no light bulb, it has no ultimate expression. The lampstand&#8217;s ultimate expression is the bright shining of its seven lamps. The church in each locality can be such a lampstand, shining in the darkness, because all of you individually are being transformed. The element of gold is increasing in you, resulting in your expressing God Himself.<p>The golden lampstand is God Himself and also the church. This reality is accomplished by the seven Spirits, which are the Spirit. In the end the Spirit and the Bride become one entity. This is what the church is. This is the final objective toward which God is aiming. This is the work of the Spirit in us. By these seven Spirits, seven lamps, and seven eyes, all that God is will be shined into us. By this transfusion of Himself, we shall be metabolically changed to become the golden lampstand in reality.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT OF MAN</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Zech. 12:1; Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27</h1><h2 class=head1>AN OVERLOOKED PART OF MAN</h2><p>The matter of man&#8217;s spirit is a most neglected subject. Even among Christians there is an inadequate understanding and appreciation of the human spirit.<p>After a conference I had in Hong Kong in 1954, a Brethren preacher who had attended came to talk with me. He had enjoyed the conference, he said, but could not quite agree with everything that was said. The distinction I had made between spirit and soul he would not accept. Man, in his view, has only two parts: a material, physical body and a psychological, invisible soul. Spirit and soul, he felt, were interchangeable terms.<p>I pointed him to 1 Thessalonians 5:23: &#8220;...your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; If spirit and soul referred to the same part of us, there would have been no need for Paul to put the conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; between them. It seems as if Paul deliberately wanted to make a distinction between these two parts, lest anyone think they were the same.<p>This preacher refused to be convinced, maintaining that the two were the same in spite of this clear verse. All I could say further was, &#8220;Brother, if you do not believe the word of the Bible, and insist on holding on to your concepts, there is nothing more for us to talk about. I choose to walk in the way of the Bible. You can keep walking in the way of your concepts.&#8221;<p>As I mentioned in a previous message, confusion as to the difference between soul and spirit is partly due to the inaccurate translation of pneuma and cardia into Chinese. Romans 1:9, for example, reads: &#8220;For God is my witness, Whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.&#8221; In the Chinese rendering, it says, &#8220;...Whom I serve with my heart.&#8221; The Greek word pneuma means air, spirit, and wind; it cannot be translated heart. It is because of the confounding of these terms and the creation of the term heart-spirit by the translators of the Chinese Bible, that the readers of the Chinese version are for the most part unaware of the significance of the spirit.<p>In the world today it seems that no one pays attention to the spirit. As soon as a child is born, his mother takes care to see that he is fed, bathed, clothed, and kept comfortable. All these needs for food, clothing, and lodging concern mostly the body. As the child grows, he goes to school, where they cater to his mind. Some people continue this educational process until their hair turns white. The shops take care mainly of the needs of the body or offer things for sale that appeal to the emotions. Thus, mankind seeks to supply the needs of the body and the soul, totally unaware that one third of his being is neglected.<p>You may say that a shop which sells Bibles is caring for man&#8217;s spirit. Truly the Bible is for the spirit. However, the salesman is probably ignorant of the spirit. Furthermore, all too often the Bible is used for knowledge. In seminaries and Bible colleges, the study of the Bible has become a matter of research, of debate, or of justification for religious concepts. Both the secular world and the religious world, then, largely disregard the spirit.<h2 class=head1>TERMINOLOGY OR EXPERIENCE?</h2><p>You may be tired of hearing me speak so much about the spirit. You may be of the opinion that this is my only topic. You may wonder how much I know of various doctrines. Why has this been my pet subject for thirty years? If you will excuse me for saying so, I could easily teach courses on prophecy and typology. I am all too familiar with them. I no longer have any interest in these subjects, however. It is only the matter of the spirit which burdens me. The more I speak on this, the heavier my burden becomes.<p>By now you are probably familiar with the terminology regarding the spirit, from having heard or read so many of my messages on the subject. How much time, however, do you actually spend in the spirit? Not including your eight hours of sleep, how many of the remaining hours of the day do you live in the spirit? I ask myself this question also. Within me I am sometimes rebuked by the Lord that with all my speaking about the spirit, much of the time I do not remain there myself.<h2 class=head1>THE EFFORT REQUIRED</h2><p>To live in the other parts of your being, no effort is required. It is natural to be in your flesh and to be loose, doing as you will in a careless way. To stay in your mind with all its considerations and analyses is a comfortable place to be, especially for the brothers. To live in your emotions and react according to their dictates is common, especially for the sisters. It may be that when you pray, you are in the spirit. Most of the time you spend in prayer, however, you may still be in your emotions, weeping, or in your mind, figuring things out. You may exercise your spirit when you come to the meetings, but usually your calling on the Lord sounds hollow, because your daily life is not spent in the spirit.<p>Even though we are in the churches of the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we too neglect our spirit. Once again I would like to try to persuade you of its importance.<h2 class=head1>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Man can be likened to a radio. The Spirit of God is like the heavenly radio waves. The spirit in man is like the radio receiver. Many radios do not function because their owners do not use their spirit! People are unable to contact God because the receiver within them is out of order.<p>I would remind you again how much importance God gives to the spirit. Zechariah 12:1 tells us that the Lord &#8220;stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.&#8221; Here are the important things in the universe-the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. The verse does not even say man, but rather the spirit of man. You bathe regularly to make sure your body is clean, but this verse focuses on the spirit, not the body. Do you care about your spirit being clean? God&#8217;s concern is for the spirit, but man&#8217;s attention is devoted to the body. The body is just clay; it is the spirit which is precious.<h2 class=head2>For Receiving God</h2><p>The heavens are for the earth. Without them the earth cannot exist. The earth is for man. Without it man cannot survive. Man has a spirit which is for God. God wants man to receive Him; that is why he was created. If man had only a body, he would not be able to receive God who is Spirit. By creating a spirit in man, God made man with a part that corresponds to Himself.<p>Genesis 2:7 reads, &#8220;And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.&#8221; This verse indicates that man has three parts. His physical part was made of the dust of the earth. Then the breath of life which was breathed into him became his spirit. When the body and the spirit came together, there was the soul. The body is for man&#8217;s survival. The spirit is for him to contact God. The soul is for man&#8217;s self-expression. Of these three, the most important is the spirit, which came from the breath of life.<h2 class=head2>For Searching Man&#8217;s Inner Being</h2><p>&#8220;The spirit of man,&#8221; Proverbs 20:27 tells us, &#8220;is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the chambers of the soul&#8221; (lit.). The word spirit in this verse is the same Hebrew word as that translated breath in Genesis 2:7. The breath of life which God breathed into man became man&#8217;s spirit. Though this spirit is distinct from God, it is close to Him in nature. Thus, the spirit can receive God and also work for Him. It is a lamp, searching man&#8217;s inward parts.<h2 class=head2>For Inwardly Governing Man</h2><p>Care for your spirit! All the inner chambers of your soul must be controlled by the spirit. Every country needs a central governing body. What is the central government in you? Sorry, I do not believe it is your spirit!<p>When the brothers come together, the central government is in control because they begin by praying. The first few minutes of talk continue the atmosphere of prayer. But before too many minutes have gone by, the central government collapses! One brother expresses his opinions. Another says that the first is unfamiliar with the situation and therefore does not know how to handle it properly. The first brother then wants to know what makes the second think he is so well qualified. Is it right to heed your spirit when you pray, but disregard it when you talk to your brothers? Should it be your opinions which control you?<p>If you are older, your opinions may not be so manifested. You have been in the church life so long that your rough edges have been chipped off. Outwardly you are smooth and agreeable. Inwardly, however, you are unwilling and dissatisfied. Dissatisfaction may be your central government.<p>In the central government of the sisters, emotion holds the posts of president, prime minister, and chief of staff! The spirit is useful when they pray, but when they are angry they feel they must give vent to their emotions. Later they will repent, but at the time they give way to their temper.<p>The central government of some saints is quick action. Without regard for the spirit, they make decisions, take action, and get things done, the quicker the better.<p>It seems that only when we pray is our spirit given its normal place. As soon as we finish praying, we in effect say, &#8220;Good-by, spirit. Now that my praying is over, I don&#8217;t need you any longer. I want to take care of things myself in my way.&#8221; This kind of attitude makes us like the unbelievers. Neither they nor we are living by the spirit.<p>Even the Lord has no way to control you. You may say, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t God almighty? He should control me so that I don&#8217;t lose my temper!&#8221; God controls you in your spirit. If you do not contact Him, He cannot control you. The Lord is like electricity. If the current cannot get through to the outlet, you may have the lamp plugged in, but the light will not go on when you turn the switch.<h2 class=head1>RESTRAINED BY THE SPIRIT</h2><p>What is it like to let the spirit be our central government? We shall find our thoughts restricted. We shall not dare to utter our opinion. Words will not come out of our mouth so lightly. Our pride will be smitten. We shall sense a restraint or a constraint in even the smallest things we do.<p>When you were out of the spirit, you felt free to live as you wanted. You may have hated others, told lies, or stolen. Your actions may have been wild. The Bible says of those who utterly disregarded their spirit, the part of their being closest to God, that &#8220;God gave them up&#8221; (Rom. 1:28). Those in this world who have turned away from God, God has let go. After you are saved, however, God would have you turn to your spirit. That is the place where He is, the place where He may be contacted. God wants to bring you under His strict control, in big things and in small, even in your words.<h2 class=head1>TURNING AND RETURNING</h2><p>&#8220;O Lord, preserve me in the spirit.&#8221; It is here you enjoy the presence of God and are one with Him. Do not be concerned about your problems. Do not shed tears over them. Do not argue. Do not focus on your troubles. Whatever your situation, however provoking your circumstances, turn to your spirit.<p>If your wife aggravates you, do not be drawn out by her. The more you look at her, the angrier you will feel. The more you listen to her words, the more you will feel like exploding. Return to your spirit. Call upon the name of the Lord. Say, &#8220;Lord! Lord, save me! Preserve me in the spirit!&#8221; This is the secret of overcoming and of holiness.<p>May the Lord show us the importance of this spirit that He formed within man. It came from God as the breath of life and is very close to Him. By means of this organ we can contact Him, and God can search all the parts of our inner being. Let us make this spirit our home and stay there. By remaining here we shall meet God and enjoy Him.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PRACTICAL EXPRESSION OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26-27; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Isa. 9:6; John 14:9; Eph. 4:6; John 1:1</h1><h2 class=head1>THE TRINITY</h2><p>The Spirit, we have said, is the ultimate expression of God. Such a statement touches the doctrine of the Trinity, one of the most mysterious doctrines in the Bible and one which has caused endless debate. The Bible does reveal to us that God is three and yet also one. This is what the term triune means.<p>Yet we cannot liken the Trinity to three persons forming a corporation. God is not corporate! The many saints comprise one Body, but it is not consistent with the truth to say that the three Persons of the Godhead form one body. For several years now we have tried to avoid using the word Persons in referring to God. Three Persons too easily conveys the thought of three Gods.<h2 class=head1>ONE GOD</h2><p>God is one. Both the Old Testament and the New make this abundantly clear. Isaiah 45:5 says, &#8220;I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God besides me.&#8221; First Corinthians 8:4 says, &#8220;There is none other God but one.&#8221; In the whole universe there is only the one true God, and this God is one, not divided into three.<h2 class=head1>FATHER, SON, AND SPIRIT</h2><p>There is another side, however, which the Bible presents. Notice how God speaks in Genesis 1:26: &#8220;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&#8221; Why does God here refer to Himself as plural? Verse 27 says, &#8220;So God created man in his own image.&#8221; Here God is referred to as singular. Is God singular or plural? He is triune, both three and one. Verse 27 indicates that He is singular, but how many &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; means we do not know until we come to Matthew 28:19!<p>This verse reads, &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This word was spoken to the disciples after the Lord was resurrected. This verse indicates to us that God is triune; notice, however, that &#8220;name&#8221; is singular. The Father, Son, and Spirit are three, but the name is one.<p>There are several other indications of the Trinity in the New Testament. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen&#8221; (Gk.).<p>Ephesians a number of times implies that God is triune. In 3:14, 16, and 17 Paul says he bowed his knees to the Father, that we would be strengthened through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in our hearts. In 4:4-6 we have one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all. See also Ephesians 1:11-13 and 2:18.<h2 class=head1>THE CONTROVERSY</h2><p>Because the doctrine of the Trinity has the aspects of both the one and the three to explain, the disputes concerning it have not been resolved even after all these centuries. Furthermore, the truth of the Bible cannot be comprehended by man&#8217;s limited mentality.<p>Suppose two blind men touch someone&#8217;s head. The first finds that there are seven openings in it. The second checks the head only from the back; he declares it has no openings. They argue, accusing each other of lying. Who is right? Both are, because a head has both a front and a back. Neither of them has the complete picture; they are arguing out of blindness.<p>Theologians have treated the matter of the Trinity in much the same way. Some argue from the side of the oneness of God&#8217;s being. Others argue from the side of the three Persons. This battle continues even today. Those who take an extreme view in favor of the side of one may fall into the heresy of modalism. Extremists on the side of the three are called tritheists. We must be careful not to overemphasize one side or the other, lest we fall into error.<h2 class=head2>Tritheism</h2><p>Several years ago a brother in Hong Kong opposed my saying that Christ is the Spirit. One day he came to visit me at home, and we talked together about this. I asked him, &#8220;Brother, how many Gods do you believe in?&#8221; Without hesitation he replied, &#8220;Three. The Father is a God, the Son is a God, and the Spirit is a God.&#8221; Isn&#8217;t this unbelievable! Yet many Christians really believe in three Gods. They do not dare to express their belief openly, because it is contrary to the Scriptures, but in their way of thinking of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, They are three Gods. Part of the fault for this erroneous concept lies with the use of the term Persons for the Godhead. Because of the limitations of language, we sometimes have to use this term, but if we overemphasize the concept of three Persons, we may be led into tritheism.<h2 class=head2>Modalism</h2><p>Modalism is another heresy, resulting from taking an extreme position. Its leading exponent was Sabellius, who claimed that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were not eternally co-existent. In modalistic thinking the Three are merely three successive manifestations of the divine Being or three temporary modes of His activity. Passages like Isaiah 9:6, where the Son is called the everlasting Father, and John 14:9, where the Lord says, &#8220;He who has seen Me has seen the Father,&#8221; are used to support modalism&#8217;s position.<p>Just as tritheism pushed the matter of the three Persons too far and ended up with three Gods, so modalism pushed the oneness of the Godhead too far and taught that when the Son came the Father was over, and when the Spirit came the Son was over.<p>This teaching we cannot accept. The Scriptures clearly tell us that all Three eternally co-exist. John 1:1 says, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&#8221; The Word is the Son. He was present in eternity with God, the Father, and was God. In John 17:5 the Lord prayed concerning the glory He had shared with the Father before the world was. Both the Father and Son, then, are coeternal. That the Spirit also is eternal is clear from Hebrews 9:14, where He is called &#8220;the eternal Spirit.&#8221; It was this Triune God who said in Genesis 1:26: &#8220;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&#8221; All Three were there before man&#8217;s creation.<p>Both tritheism and modalism have tried to explain the mystery of the Trinity and have gone too far. One went to the North Pole and the other to the South! According to what we understand of the Scriptures, we have taken a position in the middle.<h2 class=head1>THE NICENE CREED</h2><p>Many of you are familiar with the Nicene Creed. Those who have tritheistic leanings (even though they would not admit they do) for the most part subscribe to this creed. You need to be aware of the background from which the creed came. In A.D. 325 the Emperor Constantine convened a council at Nicaea to resolve the theological questions that were causing disputations. Constantine&#8217;s efforts were directed toward unifying the many diverse peoples and cultures that comprised the Roman Empire. The Council of Nicaea was part of this effort. After hearing the arguments presented at the Council by the various factions, Constantine, who was presiding, proposed the position to be taken. These beliefs were embodied in the Nicene Creed, which both Catholicism and most Protestant denominations endorse.<p>Strange to say, at the time when this pagan Emperor was decreeing what beliefs Christians should hold, there were seven books of the Bible that were not even officially recognized as canonical. Hebrews and Revelation were two of these. Not until A.D. 397 did a council of Carthage, North Africa, decide that these and five other books should also be considered as part of the Bible. Thus, the light from these books -like the seven Spirits, for example, which are only mentioned in Revelation-did not enter in to the statement the Council of Nicaea drew up about the Trinity.<h2 class=head1>THE PERSON OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p>The saints throughout the centuries past have been ignorant as to the human spirit and the Spirit of God as well. In the seventeenth century, when the King James Version was done, the translators considered the Spirit as a power, not as a person. Thus, in Romans 8, twice we find the term &#8220;the Spirit itself&#8221; (vv. 16, 26). It was in the last century that the Brethren realized this error and saw that the Spirit was a Person, like the Father and the Son. Yet the Brethren did not pay much attention to the importance of the seven Spirits, nor did they have any idea that these Spirits are the ultimate expression of God.<h2 class=head1>A PROGRESSIVE REVELATION</h2><p>From these glimpses into the past we can see that the revelation of the Bible is progressive. The same is true with regard to the recovery of the Bible. Martin Luther&#8217;s revelation was only to a certain point. Gradually, more and more has been uncovered and recovered. Our vision today is the most far-reaching, because we stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before. Edison is regarded as the father of electricity, but what we know today about electricity goes far beyond Edison&#8217;s knowledge. The recovery of the truth, like the advances in science, builds upon the past.<p>Martin Luther was in Romans, the early chapters, and in Galatians. Today we are in the beginning of Revelation. We are at least in chapter one, for we as the local churches are the golden lampstands. If we were to discuss this with someone in the denominations, however, he would probably wonder what on earth we were talking about. Why are those in the denominations ignorant of the golden lampstands? It is because, for the most part, they are still in the first part of Romans.<p>The Jews believe the Bible, but their belief stops with Malachi. They know God as God and as Jehovah. In the New Testament we have Jesus Christ. The name Jesus means Jehovah the Savior or Jehovah our salvation. But the Jews reject Jesus Christ. Christians, however, all believe in God, Jehovah, and Jesus Christ; but when it comes to the Spirit, not all believe that the Holy Spirit is God. We believe that Christ is the Spirit; He is both Jehovah and the Spirit. We also believe in the seven Spirits, who are the ultimate expression of God. God is Jehovah. Jehovah is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the Spirit. The Spirit is the seven Spirits.<p>Does your belief in God go only as far as Genesis? If so, perhaps you should meet with the Jews in the synagogue! If you believe that Jesus Christ is God, but that He is not the Spirit, you are still in the Gospels. This is the extent of what many in the denominations believe about God. We in the church today, however, believe in the seven Spirits. We do not believe in only a portion of the Bible. We believe it from Genesis to Revelation.<p>I would encourage you to read the books we have written on the matter of the Triune God. These books have been written only after a thorough study of the Bible and also after much research into the historic teachings of the great scholars in Christianity. We have not lightly or arbitrarily taken a position on any truth. We do not incline toward the right or toward the left. We have avoided extremes. I believe the truth in our midst is most accurate and balanced. We recognize that in the Triune God there is the aspect of the three, yet we are not tritheists. We acknowledge that the Triune God has also the aspect of the one, yet we cannot accept modalism. Throughout the centuries orthodox Bible scholars have all recognized that God is three and also one, yet He is not three Gods nor did He exist in three different modes. He is triune, three in one!<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE</h2><p>The seven Spirits, as we have said, are the ultimate expression of God, Jehovah, Jesus Christ, and the Spirit. These seven Spirits are being wrought into the church, so that it becomes one with the Triune God. Thus both the Triune God and the church are portrayed by a golden lampstand. The ultimate expression of both is the seven lamps.<p>These seven lamps shining from the lampstand symbolize the testimony of God. This testimony is God Himself. At the end of the Bible, when the Spirit and the Bride together say, &#8220;Come!&#8221; (Rev. 22:17), the two have become one in reality.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>TO BE A PERSON IN SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4, 6, 14; Eph. 6:18; 1 Thes. 5:17, 19; Rev. 1:10a</h1><h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S DESIRE FOR US</h2><p>God intends to work Himself into us to be both our life and our nature. He wants us to live Him out. In order to accomplish this intention, God created a spirit within man. Then He Himself became flesh and went through death and resurrection, at which point He became the life-giving Spirit. Before the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, this life-giving Spirit, who is known in the New Testament as the Spirit, &#8220;was not yet&#8221; (John 7:39).<p>When we repent and believe in the Lord, our conscience, which is within our spirit, has effectively functioned. We confess our sins and are cleansed by the Lord&#8217;s precious blood. Our spirit is regenerated, and the Spirit comes to dwell in our spirit, so that the two become one. &#8220;He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:17). How glorious it is that we sinners, after being cleansed by the precious blood, can be one spirit with God!<h2 class=head1>LIVING BY THE FLESH</h2><p>Now He wants us to live in this spirit. The Scripture tells us that there are &#8220;those who are according to flesh&#8221; and &#8220;those who are according to spirit&#8221; (Rom. 8:5). To walk according to flesh means to carry out whatever the flesh desires. A fleshly person eats whatever he wants and drinks whatever appeals to him. Even if what he does is illegal or harmful or sinful, he is not concerned. He shamelessly indulges his flesh and answers to no one.<h2 class=head1>LIVING BY THE EMOTION</h2><p>Besides this kind of person who walks in the lusts of the flesh, there is the natural man, who lives according to the soul (1 Cor. 2:14). A sister, for example, may live by her emotions. When she expresses her opinion, it is not well reasoned; it is simply how she feels. Sometimes she will be excited and happy; other times she is depressed and tearful. To live by the emotions is not evil like living according to the flesh. But even though she may not be engaging in sinful things, there will be times when she loses her temper. Then she is close to being in the lust of the flesh. Her face turns livid, her self-control vanishes, and the angry words spill out unchecked. Afterwards, she will feel ashamed and remorseful.<h2 class=head1>LIVING BY THE MIND</h2><p>A brother, on the other hand, usually lives by his mind. He is less inclined to be bad-tempered. When he participates in a conversation, his words are carefully chosen. His position on different matters is well thought out, so that he gives the impression of being intelligent, reasonable, and even wise.<p>This type of person we all naturally admire. He is living by the mind, but he impresses us more than the one who lives by her emotions. Both, however, are living according to the soul, and in our thinking we rank them higher than those who live according to the flesh, indulging themselves without restraint.<p>What God wants, of course, is that man live according to the spirit. Those who do are the highest class of humanity.<p>Because the Lord today is the Spirit living in our spirit, for us to live according to spirit is to live according to Him. When we live by the spirit, the Lord is living out from us, because we are one with Him in spirit. When we live according to the flesh, we cannot touch Him. When we live by the soul, the Lord cannot live out from us; we are simply living by ourselves. Whenever we live by the spirit, however, we experience Him.<p>If you ask me where the Lord is, I shall tell you that He is within your spirit. Do not think of Him as being far away in heaven. Do not look around for Him. He is within you! The Lord Jesus is with your spirit. How precious and glorious this is!<h2 class=head1>LIVING BY THE BIBLE</h2><p>All of you who are saved, and especially who are in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, must live according to the spirit. You must not live according to anything else. You may wonder about living according to the Bible. Usually your efforts to follow the Bible come from the mind. If you want to know what your relationship to your wife should be, you read the Bible passages that deal with that subject. You find out that you must love your wife. Ephesians 5:25 says so. Then you purpose in yourself to love her. You have understood the Bible according to your mind and you now attempt to fulfill it by your will. What kind of living is this? It is the living of the soul. It is not evil living, but nonetheless it is not according to the spirit. Your intention is good. Before you were saved, you had little love for your wife. She had too much to say, was always criticizing how you did things, and kept checking up on your whereabouts. Or, your wife may have been overbearing in her love for you. She may have closely supervised everything you wore, carefully watched that you took your vitamin pills, and seen to it that you did not stay up too late. During your honeymoon you could stand it, but afterwards it became unbearable. You came to hate her and her nagging ways.<p>Your dislike of her was a matter of the soul. Now that you are saved, you read your Bible regularly and try hard to obey what it says. Thus, you are trying to love your wife. This love is in your soul, just as your hatred was in your soul. Dear brother, you must live according to the spirit. If you love your wife, it must be because you are living according to the spirit. Your wife may keep on nagging you, but you continue to live according to spirit.<p>By living in the spirit you will find that you are living in the heavens, because your spirit is linked to heaven. The spirit is the Holy of Holies. In this place nothing can disturb you. This realm is unchanging, whatever the outward circumstances are.<p>If you live in the soul, you will change with your circumstances. When the weather is sunny, you will be cheerful. When the sky is overcast, you will be sad.<h2 class=head1>LIVING BY THE SPIRIT</h2><p>How can we be those who live according to the spirit?<h2 class=head2>Slow Down!</h2><p>For one thing, we must not act or react in haste. Even if we are about to lose our temper, we must slow down. The first time our wife provokes us, we may be able to exercise patience. By the third time, however, all our patience is gone, and we are ready to explode. This is the point when we must tell Satan to hold off for a minute or two; we need that little extra time before we give vent to our anger. In other areas of our living also, we must not act hastily. This applies to our talking, to the look we give others, and to the opinion we express.<p>Why is it important for us to slow down? We are used to living in the soul. It is natural for us to be there. Our parents and our education have encouraged us to live according to the soul. Now that we are saved, the Lord wants us to be a people living according to the spirit. We have little hope of changing, however, unless we slow down these spontaneous reactions and ways of looking at things. If we are fast, the likelihood is that we are in the soul. If we are slow, we give ourselves the opportunity to turn to the spirit.<p>Use this little time you give yourself by slowing down, to pray. By praying, you enter into the spirit. There you will have a different view of the situation. If your wife aggravates you, your soul is filled with dislike for her. When you are viewing her from the spirit, however, you may praise the Lord for giving you such a desirable wife. In all these human relationships, the view from the soul is one thing and the view from the spirit another. When you are in the soul, you are in trouble and will offend the Lord. If you turn to your spirit, however, you will immediately be preserved and will enjoy the Lord&#8217;s presence.<p>When you go shopping, something may catch your eye and you may feel free to buy it. But if you will restrain your impulse and turn to your spirit, you may find after praying a little that the article has lost its appeal and that your intention to buy it is gone. It looked one way to the soul, but another way to the spirit.<p>A brother may come to talk to you about a certain matter. As you are listening, you may feel negative about what he is saying. Inwardly, however, you remind yourself to turn to the spirit. As you remain in your spirit praying, your view of what he is saying may completely change.<p>Many times when you are in your soul, you want to do something or go somewhere. Once you turn to your spirit, however, the urge is gone.<p>Do you want to live according to the soul or according to the spirit?<p>It is difficult to stay all the time in spirit. Before we realize it, we have slipped out. Suppose a brother comes to fellowship with me. At first I am watchful to remain in my spirit. I listen in spirit, and what I say in reply comes from the spirit. We both are greatly enjoying the fellowship together. Then in a moment of joy I fall back into my soul; unconsciously I have slipped out of my spirit.<p>We easily slip into our soul because it is right next to the spirit. The soul is where our person is. God has saved us and moved us to our spirit. Though we recognize this, we still like to live in the soul. We are like a girl who is newly married. She loves her husband, but she still likes to go back to her old home. While she is at work, she secretly slips over to her mother&#8217;s for a visit.<p>The Lord wants a people who live according to the spirit. This is not to say that He wants us to do the right thing and refrain from doing what is wrong. If we live by the soul, no matter what good thing we do, it counts for nothing. God has set us in our spirit and is causing us more and more to live there. We can do this first of all by not being in a hurry.<h2 class=head2>Set the Mind on the Spirit!</h2><p>&#8220;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace&#8221; (Rom. 8:6). The second help to staying in our spirit is to set the mind on the spirit. Our mind represents us. Where we put our mind is where we are. Just as I can put my Bible here on this table, so we can place our mind on the table of our spirit, where the Lord is. That spirit is always available for our minds to be put there.<p>It is an exercise for us to do this. First, we must slow down. Then, we must set our mind on the spirit. Immediately the Lord will emerge. When our mind is set on the spirit, there is life and peace.<p>We Christians are not here simply to be moral people. We are here to live the Lord out. Today He is the Spirit and is within us. He wants us to live according to our indwelt spirit. In our living throughout the day, in things great and small, we must react slowly and we must set our mind on the spirit.<h2 class=head2>Pray!</h2><p>Then we shall touch the Lord, and immediately we must pray. There is no need to go into our room and shut the door. If we are driving, we do not need to pull over to the side of the road and stop. If we are working in the office, we do not have to drop what we are doing. As soon as we set our mind on the spirit, we can pray. As we drive or as we work, we can pray spontaneously, we can call upon the Lord, and we can breathe Him in.<h2 class=head2>Gird Up the Loins of Your Mind!</h2><p>If we slow down, set our mind on the spirit, and pray, we shall experience the reality of being one spirit with the Lord. We shall not be affected by outward circumstances. Whether we are praised or rebuked will make no difference. If our wife is angry, we shall not be provoked. When we are well liked by others, we are unmoved. If they spurn us, it makes no difference. We are in spirit and therefore one with the Lord. Naturally and spontaneously we live Him out.<p>This is not difficult! All it requires is exercise. To be a person in spirit is within the reach of every brother and sister. The problem is that we are in the habit of living naturally and are unwilling to make the effort to slow down, to set our mind on the spirit, and to pray.<p>We must be like soldiers in battle. We must gird up our loins (1 Pet. 1:13). When we do things in a natural way, we have our belts loosened. We cannot be casual, waiting for fate to decide what happens. As soon as we wake up in the morning, we must gird up our loins by turning to the Lord. By thus readying ourselves for battle, we take the ground away from Satan.<p>Are you willing to live in your spirit? If not, there is no way. If you are, it is simple to slow down before you react, to set your mind on the spirit, and to pray. It is not so much a matter of understanding; it is rather like eating or breathing. Everyone can do it, even without knowing why or how.<p>We are still under the influence of religion. We prefer to live in our mind. It is difficult to make this change to our spirit. That is why we have to keep on reading and listening to message after message. It is all too easy to listen from a doctrinal point of view and then to argue about what we think is wrong. Let us cease our concern about doctrines. Simply say, &#8220;Lord, I praise You that I have a spirit within. I thank You that You are the Spirit and that You have come into my spirit. You are one spirit with me. All that You want of me is that I live according to the spirit. I would set my mind on the spirit and be watchful to stay there with You.&#8221;<p>If you want to consider the matter of the church, as long as you are in your mind, the problems are endless and cannot be resolved. What about the Roman Catholic Church? the Anglican Church? the Methodists? Should there not be a pastor? Why do you not have all the chairs face the front? Why do some people keep their eyes open when they pray? Are you the only ones that are the church? Are there not saved ones in the denominations?<p>Years ago I would try to answer questions like these. I found out that as soon as one question was answered, two more would pop up. There simply is no end to the questions that arise when we are in the mind. Now I no longer answer such questions directly. I remind the inquirer that he needs to come to his spirit, not stay in his mind. In spirit he can call on the Lord&#8217;s name. Then he will be clear. The problem will no longer be there. In spirit he will receive revelation.<p>This turning to the spirit is the way to take care of all your everyday problems. If you need direction as to which way to go, talking to others will not make you clear. You will just get more befuddled. Simply turn to your spirit and pray, &#8220;O Lord! O Lord! Which way shall I take?&#8221; Then you will be clear in spirit. By setting your mind on the spirit and praying, you are one with the Lord and can be assured that the sense in your spirit is from Him. &#8220;The mind set on the spirit is life and peace&#8221; (Rom. 8:6).<h2 class=head1>THE BIBLE</h2><p>The Word exhorts us to walk according to spirit (Rom. 8:4). The Bible firstly serves to develop our spirit. As we read its pages, especially as we pray-read it in spirit, our spirit is nourished and developed. Secondly, the Bible corrects and preserves us lest we veer from the spirit. Since the spirit is abstract, we may misinterpret our inner sense. Thus, we need the Bible as a standard. Suppose, for example, we have the feeling that we should beat our wife. Since such a feeling is contrary to what the Bible says, we can be sure that the feeling we have is wrong. Some brothers may be praying about wearing their hair long, to give another example. Their sense may be that it is all right. First Corinthians 11:14, however, says that man should not have long hair. This is the Bible preserving us from being led off from the spirit.<p>Our living and our activities must not be according to the dead letter of the Bible, however, but according to the living spirit.<h2 class=head1>CONSTANT EXERCISE</h2><p>To remain in spirit, you must pray. If you neglect to pray constantly, you will find yourself out of the spirit. By constant exercise you will become a person in spirit. In the last book of the Bible, John said he &#8220;was in spirit on the Lord&#8217;s day&#8221; (Rev. 1:10). You must also be one who is in spirit. Do not desire the praise of others for your good living. Most people who seem good to us are in their soul. Do not aspire to be a good person in your soul. You need to be in spirit when you speak, when you express your attitudes, when you love others, and even when you hate. All your daily living should be in spirit.<p>Then when you go to the meetings, you will be full of the spirit. You may pray, or testify, or read a verse. Whatever you do, the spirit will be released. Do not think that shouting releases your spirit. If you are not daily exercising the spirit in your living, there can be no content of the spirit in your shouting; you are only making noise. If you are saturated with the spirit, however, then when you open your mouth, your words will have the weight of the spirit. You may shout spontaneously, but you should not shout purposely. You may say, &#8220;Lord, I praise and worship You. You are the Lord.&#8221; If you are filled in spirit because your daily living has been in spirit, your words will release life. If not, your words will sound empty; they will lack the anointing and the riches of the Spirit. If your shouting has an empty ring to it, you need to practice the proper exercise of the spirit during the whole day, not living by your soul or your flesh.<p>If you practice what I have suggested, you will experience the Lord&#8217;s leading, presence, and anointing. He will permeate and saturate you. Then when you preach the gospel, the spirit will be there. When you fellowship with others, when you visit them in their homes, and when you are in the meetings, the spirit will come forth.<p>The result of the Lord&#8217;s changing us from men of flesh into men of gold is a lampstand in reality. The seven Spirits have a way paved for them to be released from the local churches. The one lampstand with seven lamps can send forth God. This is what the testimony of the lampstand should be in each locality. The church, the golden lampstand, expresses the Triune God.<p>The key is to live according to spirit. Set your mind on the spirit. Pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). Watch unto this in all perseverance (Eph. 6:18). Quench not the Spirit (1 Thes. 5:19). Then you will be one spirit with the Lord.<p class=hbody>The fullness of God dwells in Thee;<br>Thou dost manifest God&#8217;s glory;<br>In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;<br>As Spirit, oneness with me sought.</p><p class=hbody>All things of the Father are Thine;<br>All Thou art in Spirit is mine;<br>The Spirit makes Thee real to me,<br>That Thou experienced might be.</p><p class=hbody>The Spirit of life causes Thee<br>By Thy Word to transfer to me.<br>Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,<br>Thy life in me is thus conceived.</p><p class=hbody>In spirit while gazing on Thee,<br>As a glass reflecting Thy glory,<br>Like to Thyself transformed I&#8217;ll be,<br>That Thou might be expressed thru me.</p><p class=hbody>Thy Spirit will me saturate,<br>Every part will God permeate,<br>Deliv&#8217;ring me from the old man,<br>With all saints building for His plan.</p><p class=hbody>Hymns, #501</p><h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TESTIMONY OF THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:31a, 37a; Zech. 4:2, 6, 10b; 3:9; Rev. 1:12b, 20b; 4:5; 5:6</h1><h2 class=head1>GOD BECOMING OUR LIFE</h2><p>The Bible is a precious yet mysterious book. Not only does it reveal God to us; it also speaks thoroughly about the relationship between God and man. In its pages we are told that God created man and that man must worship, love, and fear Him. God, we are also told, became our Savior by delivering us from our sins and from perdition. Most mysteriously, the Bible also reveals that this Creator and Redeemer is Spirit, and as such wants to come into us to be our life.<p>This last point is the hardest for us to grasp. Yes, we know that He is to be worshipped and obeyed as the Creator and to be believed in as our Savior and Redeemer. But to comprehend that He wants to enter into us to be our life and even our person is not easy.<p>We do have a life of our own. This life, however, is really only a picture of the true life, just as a photograph resembles us but does not have our life. The real life is God Himself entering into us. God created man in His image (Gen. 1:26-27) for the very purpose of entering into him. Man is God&#8217;s vessel (Rom. 9:21-23); God wants to be man&#8217;s content. Just as a glove is empty and meaningless, unless a hand becomes its content, so human life is also empty, unless man has God in him.<p>When we receive the Lord, He becomes our content and our life. We become one with Him. He is the life in us, and we are His living without. He lives within us, and for us &#8220;to live is Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:21). He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).<p>This relationship we have with Him is hard to express in words. Thus in the Bible there are many types, or pictures, to convey the meaning of what would otherwise be abstract. The golden lampstand in Exodus 25:31-37 is one of these types.<h2 class=head1>THE LAMPSTAND AS A TYPE</h2><p>In the Bible the golden lampstand has three stages. The first is the one in Exodus, the lampstand in the tabernacle. The second is in Zechariah (4:2-10), where God considers His people Israel as a lampstand. The last is in Revelation (1:12, 20), where the church is symbolized as a lampstand. God&#8217;s people, whether the true Israelites or the true believers, should be a golden lampstand.<h2 class=head2>Symbolizing the Triune God</h2><p>This golden lampstand has more to it than its outward appearance. Otherwise it would not shine. Its inner content is what makes it shine. In actuality the lampstand is a portrayal of the Triune God. The doctrine of the Trinity is not specifically described in the Bible, but that God is triune is made quite clear to us.<p>Our God is one; He is also three. He is the unique God, but He is also Father, Son, and Spirit. We must be careful in our choice of terms here. To say that God exists in three Persons is misleading. It is better to avoid the word Persons and simply say that He is three in one. This is what triune means; it is of Latin origin, tri meaning three and une meaning one. There is the aspect of the one and also of the three.<p>On the one hand, the Bible, in both the Old and the New Testaments, tells us clearly that God is one. Psalm 86:10 says, &#8220;Thou art God alone.&#8221; Isaiah 45:5 says, &#8220;I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God besides me.&#8221; First Corinthians 8:4 tells us, &#8220;There is none other God but one.&#8221; On the other hand, there is clear mention of the Father, the Son and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14).<p>Words cannot satisfactorily explain the mystery of the Trinity. Yet the lampstand does give us a picture of it. It was to be made all of one piece of pure gold (Exo. 25:36). There is only one lampstand for the tabernacle, yet there were seven lamps. Looked at as a whole, the lampstand was one. From the top, however, one could clearly see seven lamps. It was a seven-in-one lampstand.<p>The lampstand was to be made of a talent of pure gold. This means it weighed about a hundred pounds. The substance or essence of the lampstand, then, was gold. Gold typifies the nature of God. Unlike iron, it will not rust or change chemically, no matter where it is put. God&#8217;s nature is constant, unchanging, eternal. The gold, then, denotes God the Father as the essence and source.<p>The gold was made into a prescribed form, which indicated its function. This form is Christ, who is the image of God (2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15). When God created man, He created him in His image (Gen. 1:26). Since Christ is God&#8217;s image, man was created according to Christ. In one sense God does not have a physical form, but in another He does have an expression of His image. Christ, the beloved Son, is the image of the invisible God. What function does this form denote? He expresses God. &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#8221; (John 1:18).<p>Another characteristic of this lampstand is its seven lamps. These, the Bible clearly tells us, are the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 4:5), which are simply the Spirit of God Himself.<p>The golden lampstand, then, symbolizes the Triune God expressed. Its essence is the Father, its form is the Son, and its expression is the Spirit. In this first stage, the lampstand represents Christ. When He was on earth, the nature of God, the Father, was in Him. So was the Father&#8217;s image, because the Lord Jesus thoroughly manifested Him. As He mingled among men, Christ was also the seven lamps shining forth. Jesus Christ is the expression of the Triune God. God was in Him, upon Him, and was His very essence. Apart from Him, no one can find God.<h2 class=head2>Symbolizing the True Israelites</h2><p>In the second stage Israel is the lampstand (Zech. 4:2, 6, 10b). Israel is both individual and corporate. The individual Israelite is Christ. The corporate Israel, God&#8217;s chosen people, should be like Him, the true Prince of God. (This is the meaning of the name Israel.)<p>It was Jacob who was given the name Israel (Gen. 32:28). In his early years he surely was not a prince of God! He was a thief! God spent more than a hundred years working on Jacob, until he was transformed from a thief into a prince of God.<p>Jacob first stole from his brother Esau. Then he stole from his father. When he had to escape for his life, God spoke to him in a dream. Jacob&#8217;s vow in response to God was still in the principle of grasping something for himself (Gen. 28:20-22).<p>When he lived with his uncle Laban, He still connived to get what he could for himself. Laban, of course, tricked him in return by forcing him to take Leah when Rachel was the one he wanted to marry. But then he continued his scheming way by manipulating Laban&#8217;s flocks so that all the increase would be his.<p>God&#8217;s hand was on Jacob year after year. One thing after another was taken from him, till he was stripped of everything he valued. His beloved wife Rachel died. His favorite son was apparently killed by wild beasts. All that was left was Benjamin. Then even Benjamin was taken from him. In the end Jacob stopped struggling and surrendered. God had transformed him from Jacob the thief to Israel the prince of God.<p>Such people, who have been transformed into princes, are the true Israelites, standing as a golden lampstand. This is the second stage.<h2 class=head2>Symbolizing the Church</h2><p>In the New Testament we come to the final picture of the golden lampstand. After God saves us, He begins the work of transformation within us so that we may become a golden lampstand. Christ, who is the Head of the church, is an individual golden lampstand; the church, His body, should correspondingly form a corporate golden lampstand.<p>Is this what we are? As a church in a locality, are we truly a golden lampstand? We are surely not that by nature, for we were formed of the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7), not of gold! &#8220;The first man is of the earth, earthy&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:47). When we die, we return to the dust from which we were taken (Gen. 3:19).<p>Nonetheless, we do have gold within us. God Himself is within us, because we have been born of Him (John 1:12-13). As His children, we have His life and nature. From our earthly parents we have our human nature, but through regeneration we have been made partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Yes, we do have the gold of God&#8217;s life in us, but the question is, how much?<p>A glass may contain just a drop of water, or it may be overflowing its brim. Perhaps you have believed in the Lord. You pray to Him occasionally, but most of the time you are content to live without contacting Him. You come to the meetings only when someone brings you. Can there be any overflow from you? Does the gold have a way to increase and be formed in you? On the other hand, you may be another kind of Christian. Others can testify of you that when they talk with you, the water is always flowing over the brim. The gold in you has increased and is apparent to others.<h2 class=head1>GOLD VERSUS CLAY</h2><p>Is the church in your locality a lampstand of gold, or is it only clay? You probably will have to answer that it is part clay and part gold. You were born of dust, or clay, and you grow up to be a man of clay. For you to be transformed from a man of clay to a man of gold is not easy and requires time. If you had been born pure gold, the forming of the golden lampstand would have been simple. The church in your locality becomes a golden lampstand as all of you are transformed from clay to gold.<p>How does this come about? To remain a man of clay does not require stealing or scheming like Jacob. If we live by our natural being, even though we do not commit outward sin, we are only clay. God, the gold in us, is in our spirit. We are to live by our spirit. We are not to love or hate by our natural being. We may recognize pride as coming from ourselves; but it is also quite possible for our humility to be from the self. We must not appreciate a love or humility which is of clay. The point is not whether we love or hate, but whether our love or hatred comes from the self or from the spirit.<p>You may remember how you vowed on your wedding day to love your wife or to submit to your husband. I am sure you discovered even before your honeymoon was over that you could not fulfill your promise! It is the same story for almost everyone. Even if you do find that you are able to love your wife or submit to your husband, that love or submission is of clay. The Bible tells us that Christ lives in us (Gal. 2:20) and that to us to live is Christ (Phil. 1:21). As Christ lives in us and as we live Him, spontaneously we shall find love arising toward our wife or submission toward our husband. This love or submission is of gold, not clay.<p>How much of your daily living is gold, and how much is clay? This is the question that should concern you. Do not ask about love or hate, pride or humility. To think in those terms is to be in the realm of religion. What you need to ask is whether the love or humility is of gold or of clay. You may have a nice way about you and be well liked by others. But is your pleasant manner from the earth or from the gold? Probably it is a mixture of the two.<h2 class=head1>IN THE MEETINGS AND AT HOME</h2><p>When we are with the elders or in the meetings, we are in fear and trembling lest we display the clay. We pray and seek to exercise our spirit. But when we go home, how do we treat our wives? It is all too easy to become loose, not to pray and no longer to be watchful. Our spirit seems to evaporate. If our wife says a word which offends us, we harshly cut her off, telling her she does not know what she is talking about, or that she should mind her own business. Is this gold, or clay? It is hard for the husbands to be golden in dealing with their wives.<p>The same holds true for the sisters. In the meetings they gird up their loins and exercise to have a strong and living spirit. They seem to be all spirit. What happens to the spirit, though, when they get home? If the husband wants to know why she has gotten home so late, the sister is quick to answer that it is not late, why does he say it is late? The spirit is gone.<p>If this is the way we are as soon as we get home from the meetings, I suspect that what we display in the meetings is not the genuine spirit. It is a pretense or a performance. Our real spirit cannot evaporate! It is necessary for us always to exercise to stay in spirit and to speak from the spirit. Many times it is best not to give an answer when our spouse says a critical word to us. Simply say to the Lord, &#8220;I am one spirit with You. To me to live is You.&#8221;<p>Marriage tests whether the gold we have is real or false. Many young people, before they are married, give the appearance of gold. Once they marry, however, it seems as though all the gold is swept away. Whether we are really living by the spirit has to be tested by our home life. Our spouse knows best whether we are truly gold or only clay. If at home there is only clay, how can the church be a lampstand of gold? We need more of God&#8217;s element to be added to us!<h2 class=head1>A GOLDEN LAMPSTAND IN REALITY</h2><p>In Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the Spirit is called the seven Spirits (Rev. 4:5). This is not to say that there are seven individual Spirits. The meaning is that the Spirit at the end of the age is sevenfold intensified. It is like a lamp with a three-way light bulb. If we do not need very much light, we can turn the switch just once. If it is very dark, however, we can turn the switch three times and get the maximum amount of light. In Revelation the Spirit has been intensified not three times, but seven.<p>The church as the golden lampstand shines forth this sevenfold light. When all the clay is gone, and we have been fully transformed into gold, the Spirit of God will shine forth from within and amongst us with a sevenfold brightness. This golden lampstand will then truly express the Triune God and be His testimony. He will have been fully wrought into us. Not only will His life be in us, but His Spirit will saturate our whole being so that every part within us is simply Himself.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD&#8217;S TWOFOLD LAMPS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Zech. 12:1b; Prov. 20:27; John 3:6; 2 Tim. 4:22a; 1 Cor. 6:17; Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4, 6; Rev. 1:10a</h1><h2 class=head1>GOD AND MAN BECOMING ONE</h2><p>The Bible reveals that the relationship God desires to have with man is that He and man become one. It is not simply that the two are united together. Rather, it is a oneness in which He becomes us and we become Him. He is our life, and we are His living.<p>This relationship is an organic one. If I make a table and glue or screw the legs to the top, the relationship between the legs and the top is not organic; there is no living connection. Nor are false teeth organically part of us, even though they may look just like our natural teeth; the false teeth are lifeless.<h2 class=head1>GRAFTED TOGETHER</h2><p>Grafting illustrates the organic relationship between God and man. God is not only the Creator to be worshipped or the Savior to be believed in and followed. He comes into us to be our life. Even many preachers do not have a clear understanding of this organic union. They do not realize that &#8220;he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 6:17). God and man are not pasted together like two pieces of paper; nor are they welded together like two pieces of metal. Because God and man are both spirit, when the two spirits touch, they join and grow together.<p>When a branch from one tree is grafted to another, the life from the second tree flows into the branch, and the two become one, sharing the same life. Similarly, with a skin graft a piece of skin from one part of the body is affixed to another part. This joining produces an organic activity which results in the two growing together and becoming one. If two similar living things have a wound cut in them, when they are brought together at the site of the wounds, there is a flow of life between them and they can become organically one. This wonderful life process illustrates the relationship between God and us.<p>Have you been grafted into God? I know you worship Him as the only true God. I know that you have believed in the Lord Jesus as your Savior. But my question is, have you been grafted into Him? Your being joined to Him is not like holding hands. You would never grow together with Him by holding His hand! Nor is your relationship to Him like that of two sticks tied together! Grafting requires the life juice from the cut tree to flow into the cut branch; or, in the case of a skin graft, the cells from both parts begin to &#8220;fellowship&#8221; together and then grow together.<p>This word grow, which describes an organic process, is used in the New Testament in reference to our relationship with the Lord (see Rom. 6:5; 1 Pet. 2:2). When God is added to us, He grows with us, like living tissue which is added to the body. He is not like false teeth set next to our regular teeth! God is Spirit (John 4:24). He created a spirit in man (Zech. 12:1). It is most precious that we have a spirit, because this is the means by which we are joined to God. The two spirits can become one and grow together.<h2 class=head1>OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>We are like a small transistor radio. Within, there is a receiver. Without this receiver, the radio would be useless. The receiver must function properly, and it must be tuned in to the right station. Then it can transmit the radio waves to us as music. Some young people walk along the street with their radio next to their ear, listening to music which may be coming from far away. Are they only imagining they hear music? Can real music really be coming out of the air? They are really hearing real music, because their receiver is tuned in to the radio waves in the air.<p>Our receiver is our spirit. If it is functioning properly and is tuned in to the right station, we can receive the heavenly waves! Without a spirit we are as useless as a radio without a receiver.<p>In God&#8217;s eyes, the spirit is as great as the heavens and the earth. They are ranked together in Zechariah 12:1, where the Lord is described as the One who &#8220;stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.&#8221;<p>Man is the highest of all the created beings. Because of his spirit, he is as important as the heavens and as the earth.<p>Do you think the heavens are more important than your spirit? Many religions stress the heavens as man&#8217;s ultimate destination. God, however, is not all that satisfied with the heavens! In Isaiah 66 He describes the heavens as His throne and the earth as His footstool. Then He goes on to ask, &#8220;Where is the place of my rest? For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word&#8221; (vv. 1-2). God&#8217;s resting place is not in heaven, but in the spirit of the one who is poor and contrite. You may want to go to heaven, but God wants to enter into your spirit. The most heaven can be is God&#8217;s throne. It cannot be His resting place.<p>The heavens exist for the earth. Without the rain, sunshine, and air of heaven the things on earth could not survive. As we know from space exploration, there is no air on the moon. It is a lifeless, desolate place, where not even germs can exist! The earth, in contrast, is full of life because of the supply from the heavens. The meat we eat is available because the heavens sustain the life of the cattle, sheep, and chickens. The vegetables and grains that supply us with nourishment also owe their existence to the water, sunlight, and air from heaven.<p>Heaven sustains the earth that it may, in turn, sustain man. Plants, animals, water, air, and sunshine are all for the purpose of providing for man&#8217;s need.<p>What makes man so important that he is the focal point of the creation of the heavens and the earth? It is that man has a spirit created by God so that God could become one with him. God has no interest in becoming one with cows! The angels are not for this either. Only man has a vessel within which can receive and contain God.<p>If you think about this in a scientific, scholarly way, you will tell me it is superstitious to talk of a God who cannot be seen or touched. Where is He, you will want to know. Let me say, the question is not whether God exists; it is whether the receiver in you is functioning. You cannot know God if your receiver is out of order, anymore than you can hear the music that is in the air if your radio receiver is not working. The more you use your mind to analyze God, the farther away He seems to be. Turn away from your mind, and take care of your conscience, which is part of your spirit. If you give heed to your conscience, you will repent and confess your sins. This is the way to adjust your receiver and let in the heavenly music! Your spirit will touch God, and He will come in.<p>Formerly our spirit was without life. When God comes in, our spirit becomes alive and has another life added to it. This life is God Himself. He as the Spirit mingles with our spirit, and the two spirits become one.<h2 class=head1>GOD PROGRESSIVELY REVEALED</h2><p>God is revealed in the Bible in a progressive way. The different names for Him are gradually introduced, each indicating something further about Him. In Genesis 1:1 He is called God, and we are told that He created the heaven and the earth. In Genesis 2 the title Jehovah is added, and we are told that &#8220;Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul&#8221; (v. 7, Heb.).<p>When we come to the New Testament, we have Jesus Christ (Matt. 1:1). Do not think that God, Jehovah, and Jesus Christ refer to three different Gods. These are all names for the one God. The word Jesus simply means Jehovah is salvation. Jesus Christ is not distinct from the Jehovah of the Old Testament. Throughout the Gospels He is usually called Jesus. In the Acts the Spirit descends (2:1-4). This term, the Spirit, is used over and over again in the Epistles (e.g., Rom. 8:5; Gal. 3:2-3; Eph. 4:3; 1 Tim. 4:1; 1 John 3:24). Then in Revelation there are the seven Spirits (Rev. 4:5; 5:6), and finally, in the last chapter, the Spirit and the bride (22:17).<p>Be assured that all these terms refer to the one God. Do you believe in this one God, as revealed throughout the Bible? If your God is only God and Jehovah, you are in the same position as the Jews. Most Christians claim to believe in all sixty-six books of the Bible, but as far as their practical living goes, their experience does not reach to Romans 8. Concerning the Spirit, they have not much understanding nor experience.<p>The Lord Jesus today is more than the Savior, the One who shed His blood to cleanse us from our sins. After His resurrection, as the last Adam He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The last Adam is simply the incarnated Jesus Christ, who was crucified for us, was buried, and then in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 states, &#8220;Now the Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; That &#8220;Lord&#8221; here is referring to Christ, not God, is clear from the context. Verse 14 says the veil is done away in Christ. Verse 16 continues that when the heart &#8220;shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&#8221; Obviously Christ and Lord are interchangeable here. A few verses farther on, in 4:5, there is another confirmation: &#8220;For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord.&#8221;<p>To say that Christ is the Spirit offends some Christians; it seems to them we are mixing up two of the Persons of the Trinity. We have no obligation to support the traditional explanation of the Trinity. Our interest and our concern is with what the Bible reveals. Martin Luther in his day defied the traditions of Catholicism when he saw the light regarding justification by faith. Now that truth has been recovered. The Catholic Church, however, still rejects it. When we were in Switzerland last year, we saw a carving of a woman, representing the Roman Catholic Church, who was kicking away two men, Luther and Calvin.<p>Christianity today has a traditional theology. The light conflicts with that. We have no choice as to which we will accept. The Bible clearly tells us that God took the step of becoming flesh (John 1:1, 14). He was called Jesus. He shed His blood on the cross to redeem us. When He arose from the dead, He took the second step and became the life-giving Spirit. He became flesh to accomplish redemption for us. He became the Spirit to impart life into us. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &#8220;The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.&#8221; He can be with our spirit because He also is Spirit.<p>The general view is that the Lord Jesus has ascended into heaven and is now sitting on the throne. He has sent the Holy Spirit down to us to represent Him. Such an explanation is based upon one aspect of the divine revelation but disregards all the verses which clearly say that Christ is in us (e.g., Gal. 2:20; Col. 1:27; 2 Cor. 13:5). To say that it is the Holy Spirit representing Christ in us is a complicated explanation to support this shortsighted belief, which leans heavily on the side of God being three and is weak on the side of God being one.<p>Christ and the Spirit are like electricity. The source of the electricity is the power plant where it is produced. That electricity is the very electricity which comes into the meeting hall, transmitted as the electric current. The electric power we use in the meeting hall is not a representative of the electricity in the power plant! The Lord Jesus is the Spirit; He is both in the heavens and in us. This is the simple, clear teaching of the Scripture; we do not distort it to fit traditional beliefs.<p>At the beginning of the Bible God is revealed as the Creator and later as Jehovah. Then He became our Redeemer by passing through incarnation, death, and resurrection. Now He is the life-giving Spirit, with all the experiences through which He passed incorporated into Him. This all-inclusive Spirit, the processed Triune God, is now in our spirit. The two spirits are mingled as one.<h2 class=head1>THE INWARD SHINING</h2><p>Man&#8217;s spirit is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the inward parts (Prov. 20:27). The Spirit of God is also God&#8217;s lamp (Rev. 4:5); in fact, there is a sevenfold intensity to His shining. This is the meaning of the &#8220;seven lamps of fire... which are the seven Spirits of God.&#8221; Man&#8217;s spirit and God&#8217;s Spirit are both lamps, together enlightening the inward parts.<p>There are some people who live according to the flesh. Their only concern is the pleasure of the moment. They may drink, or dance, or take drugs with no consideration except their own gratification. Such people are generally held in low esteem.<p>Others live according to their soul. They are elated when things go well for them, but depressed when their circumstances are not favorable. Sometimes they are pleasant toward their associates, but other times they are critical or even hateful. They may be in a genial mood, or they may be in a fit of rage. These people are not well thought of by others either.<p>There are others who also live according to their soul, but are highly regarded by those who know them. Rather than being changeable like the weather, they act rationally and think ahead as to what course of action they will take. Their behavior is controlled by their thoughts.<p>These three kinds of people include almost everyone. There are very few who live according to the spirit. You were in one of these three categories until one day when you heard the gospel. The Spirit of God touched your conscience, which is part of the spirit. Your spirit was activated, leading you to repent and confess your sins. Your spirit is now a lamp indwelt by the Spirit of God, who is also a lamp. The spirit wants to enlighten every part of your soul. By responding to the spirit&#8217;s shining, you will be walking &#8220;according to spirit&#8221; (Rom. 8:4).<p>Sometimes when God wants to shine in us, we will not open to Him. This is why, after we have been praying for a while, we sometimes have nothing more to say. When we use our spirit to pray, it functions as a shining lamp, searching all the parts of our soul. It may shine on our thoughts, but we refuse to have the Lord probe there. We may not say, &#8220;No, Lord! Don&#8217;t touch there!&#8221; but that is what we mean. The spirit may shine on our emotions, especially the sisters&#8217;, but we close up, sometimes even weeping, begging the Lord not to touch that area. The same thing may happen with our will, especially the brothers&#8217;; if we close our will, the spirit cannot fulfill its function of shining. When we close the doors to the Lord&#8217;s shining, we no longer have any words to pray.<p>When we pray properly, using our spirit, there is a lamp shining. If we sense it shining on our thoughts, we can say, &#8220;Lord, I open my mind to You. Shine in me. Expose my thoughts.&#8221; In His light we confess our sins. When He shines on our emotions, we can open and confess what He reveals to be wrong. Then He will shine on our will, and we can open this room also to Him. As we open all these chambers one by one, the spirit will shine and we shall confess our sins. We can keep praying for a long time. The more we pray, the more we are enlightened. Our inward parts will all be thoroughly searched by the Lord. After such a time of prayer, we shall feel bright and transparent, filled with God. This is one aspect of the lamp, our spirit shining within.<h2 class=head1>SEVEN LAMPS SHINING</h2><p>The other aspect is that of the seven Spirits. The Spirit of God today is the seven lamps, shining on us in an intensified way. Many of us have experienced this intensified shining, far stronger than a simple prick of the conscience, condemning a wrong thought or wrong motive. What did not bother us in the past we can no longer do. If we open our mouth to tell a joke, the seven Spirits shine and our sentence is cut off in midair. If we begin to make some critical comments about a certain sister, the seven Spirits shine and our words fail. Even when we are off just a little, the Spirit is there as the light shining.<p>These seven Spirits are also the seven eyes (Rev. 5:6), watching and transfusing you with God. When we look at others, we infuse what is in us into them. As the seven Spirits shine, the seven eyes transmit God into us. It is by this means that the element of God in us is increased.<p>We are men of clay, but day by day the gold in us increases. This gold is living and flowing, as we can see from Zechariah 4:12, where we are told that the two golden pipes empty the gold (oil is not in the original) out of themselves. The gold is not a solid mass, but in a liquid state so that it can flow out. God is this gold which is flowing out of us. Formerly what flowed out of us was the bitter water of gossip, criticism, and foolish talking. Now out of us flows gold! The clay is decreasing, as we are more and more transformed.<h2 class=head1>ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2><p>For the gold in you to increase you must learn to walk according to spirit (Gal. 5:25). Again and again during the day you must turn to the spirit. &#8220;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace&#8221; (Rom. 8:6). If a problem arises with your spouse, or if a brother complains that your work is not satisfactory, do not reply in haste. A quick answer will open the door to Satan. Instead of replying, pray! Set your mind on the spirit. Call on the Lord. Then the words that come forth from your mouth will come from the spirit rather than from Satan. The Lord will be your wisdom, and gold will flow out instead of bitter water. You will sense from the Spirit of the Lord what you should say; in your speaking, He will be speaking.<p>Our greatest problem, as those whose spirits have been quickened, is that we do not live according to spirit. We live according to our mind, or our knowledge, or what the Bible teaches. To live according to spirit, we must pray without ceasing (1 Thes. 5:17). All day long we must maintain a spirit of prayer. In every situation which arises, we should pause before answering or reacting. If we take a moment to renew our touch with the Lord, then we have the opportunity to respond to the situation in spirit instead of in our natural way.<p>Ephesians 6:18 reminds us of the importance of prayer. &#8220;By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit, and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.&#8221; We need to have &#8220;all prayer... praying at every time in spirit...watching...in all perseverance.&#8221; This is the way to preserve ourselves in the spirit.<p>As we thus become one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17), He will become our living. We shall become men of gold, and the whole church will be a golden lampstand, expressing the Triune God. We shall live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:25) and have our mind set on the spirit. By the mingling of these two spirits, we can be watchful to keep ourselves in the spirit of prayer. Then what we live out will be &#8220;no longer I...but Christ&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). To us to live will be Christ (Phil. 1:21). This is the normal way for us to live. It is by this means that the church will become a golden lampstand.</body></html>
