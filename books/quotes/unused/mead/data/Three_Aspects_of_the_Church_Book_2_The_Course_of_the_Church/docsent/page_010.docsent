   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE SPREADING OF THE CHURCH 2 THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE SPREADING OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the church was spreading, Satan created three problems through various people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These three problems limited the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Dead Ordinances</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first problem encountered in the spread of the church was the limitation and bondage of Judaism Acts 15:1-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believers in Judea were Jews who still kept the traditions of Judaism; they looked at the church from a Jewish viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They tried to put the church into the "box" of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan used human religion and so-called piety to limit the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Jews believed that their law, ordinances, and rituals were from God and pertained to piety; therefore, they considered themselves as those best able to keep God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan used this thought to severely limit the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only Paul's seeing of the heavenly vision enabled the lifting of this limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After Acts 15, when the church spread out, Satan could not continue to use Judaism to limit the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts 13 shows that when the church was beginning to spread among the Gentiles in other words, to spread to every place on earth Satan used Judaism to limit, prevent, and frustrate this spread.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This illustrates a principle that we must bear in mind: things that we consider to be pious, such as religious ordinances, forms of worship, and even Bible knowledge, are often used by Satan to limit the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout church history, each time the church has spread, it has been through a group of people whom God empowered to break through religious rituals, ordinances, and dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, on the one hand, we should obey the Bible, walk in its light, and comply with the teachings of the truth; this is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other hand, however, we must ask ourselves whether our Bible knowledge and our light of the truth are dead or living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have only dead doctrines, this will limit and frustrate the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Consider the sisters' preaching of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Corinthians 14 states that sisters should not teach in the meetings v. 34 . We confess that this is a scriptural truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the word of God, but if we keep it as a dead ordinance, it will give Satan ground to come in and limit the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, a sister came to a remote mountain village one day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was no church in that place, nor were there any brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If that sister kept the dead letter and thus refrained from preaching the word, she would frustrate the work of the Holy Spirit and give Satan an opportunity to limit the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the truths in the Bible are living, not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we take the truth as a dead ordinance, we limit the work of the Holy Spirit; when we limit the work of the Holy Spirit, we limit the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The brothers and sisters coordinate together in the Body according to God's ordained arrangement, each functioning in his or her place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When there are brothers in the meetings, the sisters should stay in their position and not say anything in the way of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, this is not a dead regulation but a living practice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, if a sister goes to a locality where there are no brothers, she should not keep this teaching in a dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not keep so-called truths as dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do, we will give Satan ground to limit the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We often say that if we do not have the confirmation of the church, we should not do things alone; we must always act in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This word is not wrong, but if there is a need somewhere and circumstances prevent us from obtaining the confirmation of the church, we should not keep the truth of "acting in the Body" as a dead ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do, it will limit the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there actually is a need, we should not allow our inability to have a confirmation to cause us to delay; this is to be living and not dead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, if the church can give us confirmation, we must check whether we are willing to receive it or if we prefer to do things alone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the church is present, but we still move on our own, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This exposes our flesh and our self.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be willing to be broken and dealt with and also to act in the fellowship of the Body; this is right and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers who are elders or co-workers should not use truths as dead ordinances to bind or rebuke others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They must always be careful to act properly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If anyone considers the examples in Acts to be dead ordinances for the church to keep, he will kill the church with dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In northern China there is a church that has not spread for more than fifty years because they have kept scriptural truths as dead ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only do they take the Old Testament ordinances as ordinances, they also take the principles of the New Testament in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the light and principles in the Bible should be applied in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During the past two thousand years, whenever regulations have bound the church, the Holy Spirit has initiated a reaction to break through the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must be careful not to deviate from the Bible; our work, service, establishing of churches, and governing of the church should all be done according to scriptural principles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, whenever we take the principles of the Bible as dead ordinances, we are in the principle of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church depends on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man can bind the church, but he cannot bind the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we limit the Holy Spirit, He will break out of the boundaries that we set in order to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Orthodox believers are always in danger of taking the truth as a doctrinal ordinance for the children of God to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is something we must strictly avoid.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Acts 14 the church had spread to the Gentiles and was spreading very quickly, but in chapter 15 the spread was interrupted because of the limiting influence of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church had an illness that had to be cured in order for it to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, in Acts 15 the apostles who had been going to the Gentiles stopped their work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead, they went from Antioch to Jerusalem to cure this illness to root Judaism out of the church once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Acts 15 was a great surgery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, was strong to eliminate the Jewish rituals and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He said that they should not put the impossible yoke of the Jewish rituals upon the neck of the disciples v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although Paul was an orthodox Jew, he had received revelation from God, and his eyes had been opened.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even the timing of his trip to Jerusalem was according to God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Not long after the meeting in Acts 15, the Roman prince Titus led the Roman army to destroy Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The apostle went to Jerusalem around A.D. 50; Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There were only about twenty years between these two events.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Spiritually speaking, God had already turned from Judaism, but the outward shell of the Jewish religion existed in the temple and the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The continuation of Judaism in Jerusalem put the church in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, God spoke through the apostle, saying that it was wrong to remain in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then He sent the Roman army to completely destroy the city of Jerusalem and to tear down the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This shows that God did not want Jerusalem to serve as a center of authority for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God did not want Jerusalem, which was colored by the influence of Judaism, to govern His church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the meeting in Acts 15 James was the leader who made the final decision.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This role was not given to Peter because he was weak during the work of spreading to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In Galatians 2:11-12, when the brothers came from Jerusalem to Antioch, Peter separated himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those of the circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He was weak and did not rise up to keep the church's testimony of not differentiating between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because of his weakness in this matter, Peter lost his leading position and was replaced by James.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In Acts 15 Paul spoke the facts about God's move among the Gentiles, but it was James who made the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>James said, based on the truth, that it was not right to harass the Gentile believers and force them to keep the Jewish laws vv.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this matter it was more difficult to speak the truth than to speak the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In Acts 15 James was very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although he was deeply influenced by the Jewish religion, under the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit, he shut Judaism out of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Thus, at that time James was called a pillar of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This shows how delighted the Holy Spirit is with the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Everything that limits the spread of the church also limits the building up of God's universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In this universe God has only one building, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, He wants to eliminate all the problems and things in us that frustrate the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Thank the Lord for Acts 15.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If this chapter were not in the Bible, we would still be confused about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Acts 15 opens the eyes of the church and allows the church to escape the bondage of Judaism and the rule of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Thus, the church can spread freely.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Satan wanted to use Judaism and Jerusalem to control, limit, prohibit, and restrict the spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But God wanted to spread to the Gentiles, to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God wanted the whole earth to have the testimony of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Paul had this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In his Epistle to the Ephesians he wrote that God wanted to make both Gentiles and Jews into the Body of Christ 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Not long after this was written, the Roman army came and destroyed Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This was not only a spiritual termination but also a physical termination.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We have to believe that this was of God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Everything that God does on the earth is for His church, including the destruction of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>God raises up and destroys kings on the earth in coordination with His work of building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Thus, the meeting in Acts 15 dealt with the relationship between the church and Judaism once and for all.</S>
