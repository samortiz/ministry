 <h2 class="head1">XLVIII. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS<br />
WITH THE REMAINING THINGS BEING<br />
ABOUT TO DIE&mdash;REV. 3:2A</h2>
<p>This also is a picture of the Protestant churches, with which some of the positive things remain but are about to die. Every item of the positive things inherited and received by the present Protestant churches remains in a dying situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">XLIX. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN SARDIS<br />
HAVING ITS WORKS NOT FOUND BY CHRIST<br />
COMPLETED BEFORE GOD&mdash;REV. 3:2B</h2>
<p>This also is a portrait of the present Protestant churches, concerning which no work has been found by the Lord completed before God.</p>
<p>The three cases related to the church in Sardis all indicate a shortage of the vigor of the divine life and a lack of the power of the Holy Spirit. To take care of these cases would force us to be enriched in the vigorous divine life and to be empowered in the powerful Holy Spirit. Only the vigor of the divine life and the power of the Holy Spirit can make us living, fresh, and complete.</p>
<h2 class="head1">L. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA<br />
BEING NEITHER COLD NOR HOT&mdash;REV. 3:14A, 15-16</h2>
<p>The main meaning of the Greek name Laodicea is the opinion, the judgement, of the people. When a local church is full of peoples&rsquo; opinions, it surely will become neither cold nor hot. Because of its lukewarmness, such a church will suffer being vomited out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth. This is to be given up by the Lord because the taste of that church is repulsive. Thus, a church that is full of peoples&rsquo; opinions, peoples&rsquo; judgments, is terrible. Even we would reject such a church in the practice of the church life, not to mention that the Lord would vomit it out. Peoples&rsquo; opinions are versus God&rsquo;s judgment and authority. This is why the Lord is standing at the door of the church in Laodicea (v. 20), indicating that the Lord has been rejected by that church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LI. THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA<br />
BOASTING, &ldquo;I AM RICH AND HAVE BECOME RICH<br />
AND HAVE NEED OF NOTHING,&rdquo; NOT KNOWING<br />
THAT IT WAS WRETCHED, MISERABLE, POOR,<br />
BLIND, AND NAKED&mdash;REV. 3:17</h2>
<p>An opinionated and lukewarm church would always be proud and boast of its riches, thinking that it has need of nothing, but not knowing its wretchedness, miserableness, poverty, blindness, and nakedness. Hence, the loving and merciful Lord counsels such a church to buy, to obtain at a cost from Him, refined gold (the tested faith for partaking of the divine nature), white garments (the conduct approvable to the Lord), and anointing eye salve (the anointing Spirit, the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit) as their remedies (v. 18).</p>
<p>The above items, XLI to LI, are all the negative items in which the seven local churches in Asia were different from one another. The seven churches as the seven golden lampstands were all identical in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ. But they were abnormally different in these eleven cases, all of which are serious tests that have done tremendous damage to the oneness of the organic Body of Christ. Hence, the Lord advised all seven churches to overcome all these tests that they might be rewarded (2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). Otherwise, they will be punished (2:5, 11&mdash;by implication&mdash;16, 22-23; 3:3, 11, 16).</p>
<p>The seven local churches in Asia were sovereignly arranged by the Lord so that they might typify all the churches in the seven stages of the church age. Thus, regardless of what stage we are in as a local church, we should take care of all the eleven cases of negative things in the proper way as shown in Revelation 2 and 3. May the Lord have mercy on us and afford us His grace and blessing that we might not be negligent and indifferent in dealing with all these oneness-damaging problems.</p>
