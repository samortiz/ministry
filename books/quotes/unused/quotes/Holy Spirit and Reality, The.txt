For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection'
To the Colossian believers, he spoke of being 'buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him'
Paul saw that baptism and burial are one and the same thing, and he also saw that baptism and resurrection are one and the same thing
In your mind, there will not be a distinction between real and false baptism, and there will be no question of an outward or inward baptism
The emphasis in the Word of God is not on a change in substance or on the matter of representation, it is on a spiritual reality
If it is a plain narration, it is presented as a plain narration, and if it is a figure of speech, it is explained as a figure of speech
To him, the spiritual reality is so real that after he said, 'we, who are many,' he followed with the words 'are one bread, one body'
Language was no longer a problem to him, and doctrine was no longer a problem to him because he touched the reality
If he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
In the Lord's mind, when the church says that a brother is right, he is right, and when the church says that a brother is wrong, he is wrong
If the judgment is wrong, it must not have come from reality, and it must not be of the Holy Spirit, but of man
When Paul spoke of the church in his Epistles, he said that it is called, it is holy, and it is the house of God
In the eyes of those who have touched the spiritual reality, the church is spiritual, and all other questions have no ground at all
When one touches the spiritual reality, he touches the church, and his actions will be the move of the Body and not independent moves
Once a person touches this reality, he will be delivered from doctrines, formalities, human thoughts, and human ways
Baptism, the breaking of bread, or the church are all realities to him; they are no longer rituals or doctrines
Brothers and sisters, have you had the experience in which someone was thanking and praising but there was not an amen within you?
Sometimes a person encounters a problem and he continues to thank and praise the Lord in a loud way acting as if there is no problem at all
Something within you says, 'It is good to thank and praise the Lord, but this kind of thanksgiving and praise is not genuine
Some people seem to be unconcerned about their problems; they fill their mouths with joyful and happy thanksgivings and praises
A real prayer may be short in words and may even be inarticulate, but when one prays such a prayer, he touches reality
We must realize that if a doctrine is in letters and not in the Holy Spirit, we will not receive any life even if we know all about it
If we merely touch the doctrines of salvation, justification, and sanctification, what we have are merely letters, and they are dead
The disciples' knowledge of the Lord Jesus in the beginning was outward knowledge; they did not have an inward knowledge of Him
The Lord clearly said, 'If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him'
Although Philip and Thomas were with the Lord, their knowledge of Him was only outward; they did not touch the reality
Although the disciples knew the Lord a little better than the Jews, they did not know what kind of Lord He was
If a man does not have the revelation even if he can eat drink walk and dwell together with the Lord Jesus he will still not know who He is
The only kind of knowledge of Christ that is real and inward is the one that Peter acquired through revelation
Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured of the affliction'
There were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian'
If a man has not touched reality, he will not change even if he manages to come before the Lord and press close upon Him
We must realize that the Christ in the flesh can be touched by fleshly hands, seen by fleshly eyes, and heard by fleshly ears
Sometimes we find a brother forgiving someone who has offended him in a very loud, forceful, and deliberate way
They say with their mouth that they can do nothing yet one has the feeling that this is selfchosen lowliness and selfimposed lowliness
It is possible to be without love even when one doles out all his possessions to feed others and delivers up his body that he may boast
It is possible for a brother to dole out all of his possessions to feed others and deliver up his body yet at the same time be without love
If a brother 'gives to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink he shall by no means lose his reward'
When we read his writings, we cannot help but bow our head and say that here is a man who is not too distant from us
At the most, a man who does this has outward conduct; he does not have the real thing, and what he has is not the reality
We can have an outward gentleness and win the praises of others, but this kind of thing has no spiritual value at all before God
At that instant, he remembered the words of Matthew 5, which say, 'Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also'
As far as their spiritual experience is concerned, they cannot tell the difference because they have not touched the spiritual reality
If you have touched the spiritual reality in one matter, no one will be able to deceive you in that matter anymore
Those who have not touched reality can only deceive two kinds of people-themselves and those whose spiritual condition is the same as theirs
If the brothers and sisters cannot respond with an amen, it means that there is falsehood and the absence of reality
Many brothers and sisters are vexing and burdening the church not only by their sins, but by their 'good' conduct
We believe that whenever one touches reality, the result is life, and whenever one does not touch reality, the result is death
Some people do certain things and feel quite happy about what they have done, yet others do not touch life, and they are not edified
May the Lord be merciful to us and may He show us that those who live in the Spirit are the only ones who live in spiritual reality
Paul said, 'Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body'
If we do not know what the 'death of Jesus' means and if we have not borne the cross in silence, we do not have the supply
Brothers and sisters, we have to remember that as far as spiritual reality is concerned, no work should be 'performed' by us
On our side, we should know the 'death of Jesus,' and on the side of the Body of Christ, there will be the supply spontaneously
It does not matter whether or not we know that others are supplied, and it does not matter whether or not we feel it
If we know what 'the death of Jesus' means before the Lord, 'the life of Jesus' will operate in the church spontaneously
Every time we pass through 'the death of Jesus,' there will always be some brothers and sisters who receive the supply of life
If we do not know the meaning of the supply of life we will not understand what Paul meant when he said Death operates in us but life in you
If we do not see that the Body of Christ is one, we will not realize how the lack of the afflictions of Christ is being filled up
One brother may be in the company of others, and he may only open his mouth for five minutes in three hours, yet others receive his supply
The Body of Christ is a fact; one does not receive the supply only when there is the shaking of hands or face-to-face conversations
It would be easy to understand him if he had said that the death of Jesus operated in him and the life of Jesus also operated in him
We admit that, outwardly speaking, individual Christians have failed and individual Christian groups have failed
The riches of the church are not diminished through the failure of individual Christians and individual groups
Supply is based on the experience of the cross, and it is also based on one's contact with the reality of the Body
We have to realize that the supply of the word is also based on what we have already imparted to the church in life
Brothers and sisters, if what we speak is what we have already given to the church, the Holy Spirit will testify to our words
Paul said, 'And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it'
May God grant us to touch the source, and may He grant us to touch reality, so that we can supply the church in a spontaneous way
Once a person touches reality, he will be enlightened within, and whether or not he can explain it, he will know it clearly within
At the same time, if the revelation of the Spirit is not matched with the discipline of the Spirit, the revelation is not complete
We can say that the revelation of the Spirit is the foundation, while the discipline of the Spirit is the building
We cannot say that revelation includes the whole of the Christian life, unless we consider discipline as part of the revelation
We have to believe in the trustworthiness of the Spirit, and we have to believe in the perfectness of the work of the Spirit
On the one hand, the Spirit gives us the revelation and brings us into that which is real so that we will see what we are in Christ
In order to lead him into spiritual reality, the Lord's Spirit will have to lead him into much discipline and trials
He measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal'
Those who are imprisoned and whose feet are secured in the locks yet still pray and sing hymns of praise to God are the ones who enjoy God
They lack spiritual reality, and what they have is not sufficient for their own use, much less for helping others
It seems as though no problem is unsolvable before them, and it seems as if no one who goes to them comes away without receiving help
Whether or not a church can be the golden lampstand and a testimony depends on how many enlarged believers are in that church
When a friend comes to us at midnight to borrow loaves and we have nothing to set before him we can go and knock on our other friends door
When other brothers and sisters are faced with problems, they cannot understand and render any spiritual help to them
With those who do not have the work of the Spirit, the Lord's riches cannot become their riches, and they have nothing to give to others
A Christian must not be so fallen as to have no intervention from the Holy Spirit, as if he is destined to poverty
Some brothers and sisters are not that eloquent in the church; they are not that knowledgeable, yet they can pray
If we do not accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit, He will not have the opportunity to lead us into spiritual reality
They may bypass the difficulties, but they have lost their opportunity for the Holy Spirit to lead them into spiritual reality
Brothers and sisters, we must accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit before we can be enlarged and before we can supply the church
Brothers and sisters, no gold or precious stone can escape the fire, and no pearl can come about without some pain
A Christian often does not touch that which is true; instead, he falls into falsehood, and he is deceived and bound by the deception
Being obsessed is believing that one has no sin and telling others that he has no sin, when he has really sinned
In one case, a man's conscience knows that he has sinned, yet he deceives others by saying that he has not sinned
In the other case, a man's mind tells him that he has not sinned, and in his heart he also believes that he has not sinned
When he wrote to the church in Philippi, he mentioned his former condition: 'As to zeal, persecuting the church'
If a man does something wrong, and not only says with his mouth but even believes in his heart that it is right, this is obsession
It is being confident both outwardly and inwardly to the extent that even the conscience seems to justify the act
The symptom of obsession is thinking and believing that a wrong thing is right to the point that one cannot say that it is wrong
One can be so obsessed that when others use God's Word and prove to him that he is wrong, he will still not take heed
It is not easy to help or correct an obsessed Christian, because he believes that his conscience says he is right
If we try to consciously say an inaccurate word, we will first deceive others, but in the end, we will fall into self-deception
When he prayed this way in the beginning, he felt somewhat strange, and he was conscious that it was not his own voice
Malachi 3:7 says, 'From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them
John 5:43 says, 'I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him'
Verse 44 says, 'How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God'?
Others may not have said something, yet they think that others have said something, and they are convinced that such a thing has been said
He becomes habitual in his lying, and he lies to such an extent that he becomes convinced that he is speaking the truth
For a person to tell another that such and such a thing happened and how real it was, when nothing actually happened, is to lie
When he first lied, he might have felt a little uneasiness, and he might have realized that a Christian should not do such a thing
As time goes on, he begins to lose his feeling, and he becomes more and more convinced in himself, believing that what he says is true
Being obsessed is fabricating something to deceive others to the extent that eventually one believes it himself
A brother once heard many testimonies from others about answers to prayers, God's blessings to works, and God's deliverance in troubles
These testimonies stirred up a kind of fantasy within him, and he began to think that his prayers also were answered
In his mouth something ordinary would become an extraordinary event, and something not so wonderful would become something quite wonderful
In the beginning, they say that they are sick in order to gain the sympathy of their relatives, friends, and family members
Being obsessed is deceiving oneself with something fabricated to the extent that one does not realize that he has been deceived by himself
Of course, some are obsessed to a smaller degree, others are obsessed to a greater degree, while some are obsessed to a very serious degree
When a man does not prefer light but prefers darkness, there is bias in his heart, and it becomes easy for him to be obsessed
A Christian may start out with the intention of gaining vainglory and position before men, and then may begin to pretend and deceive others
When a man does not receive the love of the truth, surely he believes in lies, and when he believes in lies, he is obsessed
We must realize that if a man does not receive the love of the truth once, it will be difficult for him to see the truth later
The Lord Jesus said, 'How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God'?
In the following paragraphs we will consider the way to see the true nature of things and the way to be saved from obsession
Isaiah 50:10-11 says, 'Who among you fears Jehovah;/ Who hears the voice of His servant;/Who walks in darkness/ And has no light?
If someone wants to obey the voice of the Lord's servant yet walks in darkness and does not have the light, what should he do?
You may think that you are not wrong, you may feel that you are not wrong, and you may believe that you are not wrong, but are you reliable?
Once we meet a person who knows God's light, he will know our true condition, and he will be able to point out our error
He is not fastidious; he is merely sharp with his inward eyes, and he can discover the true condition of things easily
When God's light shines on us, our true condition will be exposed, and we will see and admit how blind we have been!
If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark
