<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Hearing the Book of the Law,<br>Found by the High Priest in the Temple</H2><P>The book of the law which was found in the temple by the high priest was read to Josiah by the scribe. When Josiah heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes and commanded the high priest and his servants to inquire of Jehovah for him, for the people, and for all of Judah concerning the words of the law (vv. 8-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Receiving the Answer of Jehovah<br>through Huldah the Prophetess</H2><P>Through Huldah the prophetess Josiah received the answer of Jehovah that, because his heart was tender and he humbled himself before Jehovah, tearing his garments and weeping before Him, Jehovah would gather him to his fathers, to his grave in peace. Josiah's eyes would not see all the evil which God would bring upon the land (vv. 14-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Making a Covenant before Jehovah</H2><P>Josiah gathered to him all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and all the people and read to them all the words of the book of the covenant. Then he made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah and keep His commandments, His testimonies, and His statutes with all his heart and with all his soul, so as to establish the words of this covenant which were written in this book. All the people stood with the covenant (23:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Making a Thorough Clearance of All<br>the Idol Worshippers throughout the Country</H2><P>Josiah made a thorough clearance of all the idol worshippers throughout the country (vv. 4-20, 24). He removed, did away with, and burned the idols, especially those set up in the quarters of the temple (vv. 6, 11, 14, 24). He destroyed all the high places and other places for idol worship and the altars with the vessels built for the idols, particularly the altar, the high place, which Jeroboam the son of Nebat built, for the fulfillment of the prophecy by the man of God (1 Kings 13:1-3; 2 Kings 23:4, 7-10, 12-19). He cut off all the idol worshippers and evildoers in the land (vv. 5, 8a, 20, 24a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Holding the Passover to Jehovah</H2><P>Josiah held the Passover to Jehovah according to all that was written in the book of the covenant (vv. 21-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Jehovah Not Turning<br>from His Great Burning Anger against Judah</H2><P>Regardless of how much Josiah had done that had pleased Jehovah, He still would not turn from His great burning anger against Judah because of all the provocations by Manasseh. He would still remove Judah from His sight, as He had done with Israel, and would cast off the city of Jerusalem, which He had chosen, and the temple where He had put His name (vv. 26-27). Josiah's goodness could not rescue Judah out of God's destroying hand.</P>
