<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Man's Soul Being Corrupted,<br>Man's Body Being Changed in Nature,<br>and Man's Spirit Being Deadened</H2><P>There was another issue of man's fall which very seriously affected man's being. Due to the fall of man, man's soul was corrupted, man's body was changed in nature, and man's spirit was deadened. In the fall of man Satan saturated man's soul with his evil word and thought (Gen. 3:1-5) to corrupt man's soul. Through the fall of man, Satan as the substantial element of sin entered into man's body to cause man's body to be changed in nature to become the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3) full of lusts (Gal. 5:16b). Also through the fall of man, man's spirit was deadened by sin (Eph. 2:1). Hence, man's whole being was devastated by man's fall as a very subjective issue to man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Man Attempting to Cover Himself<br>and Hide Himself from God</H2><P>Another issue of the fall of man was that it affected man's self-consciousness and his relationship with God. After man became conscious of his nakedness due to his fall, he attempted to cover himself in his nakedness and to hide himself from God in his contact with God (Gen. 3:7-9). To cover his nakedness is man's doing and pretense. Fallen man is used to endeavoring to do something to cover his sinfulness and pretend to be something in falsehood. For man to hide himself from God is to keep himself away from God in his fellowship with God. This is the issue of man's fall that makes man false and void of God's presence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. God Not Permitting Man to Eat the Tree of Life</H2><P>Due to the corruption in man's nature through his fall, God would not permit man to eat the tree of life (Gen. 3:22) until his fallen nature would be dealt with. This indicates that God would not let His eternal life be received by man without man repenting of his sin and without the dealing with man's corrupted nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. God Driving Man Out of the Garden of Eden<br>and Closing to Man the Way to the Tree of Life</H2><P>The last issue of man's fall was that God drove man out of the garden of Eden and closed to man the way to the tree of life (Gen. 3:23-24). This was to execute God's prohibition of man from eating the tree of life. This prohibition was taken away by Christ's full redemption through His death which cut a new and living way for the believers of Christ to enter into the Holy of Holies to receive God as their eternal life (Heb. 10:19-20).</P>
