   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT NOT SUBJECTIVE ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Subjectivity is another defect in the character of some of God's children, and in particular, of some workers for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a person is subjective, he cannot do a good work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the meaning of being subjective?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being subjective means to insist on one's own opinions and to refuse others' opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means to have a preconceived idea before listening to others and to hold on to the idea even after hearing from others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Subjectivity means a reluctance to accept or to be corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It means to have one's own opinion from the very beginning and to always insist on this opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A subjective person arrives at his own judgment before he hears anything from the Lord, before the facts are unfolded, and before others present their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He insists on his judgment even after hearing something from the Lord, after the facts are unfolded, and after others have presented their side of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the meaning of being subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The root cause of subjectivity is a self that has never been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When a man's self is not broken, he has a stubborn view of things, and these opinions are hard to break and correct.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What are the problems resulting from subjectivity?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What losses does it bring to a man?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a brother or a sister is subjective, he or she will not be able to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can learn to not be subjective by listening to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must be empty within before we can take in the Lord's word or others' words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are subjective, it is difficult for us to take in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is essential for every Christian worker to cultivate the ability to hear what people have to say; he has to know others' affairs and to understand others' problems.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have previously said that a great problem with God's workers is that they cannot listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The chief reason behind not being able to listen to others is subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When a person is subjective, he is filled up with all sorts of things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His opinions become an impregnable fortress, and his ideas are unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is always filled with his own arguments and preoccupations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a brother or a sister comes to him and tries to share a frustration with him or to unload a burden to him, he simply cannot understand what they are saying, even after listening for half a day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He cannot listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is one problem associated with subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Another damaging effect of subjectivity is an inability to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A subjective person is very confident and clear about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has made up his mind about everything already.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has formed an opinion about everything, and he is confident about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is difficult for him to learn anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When some young people first join the work, it is more difficult to teach them than it is to feed a child medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It seems that some things almost have to be forced down their throat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are full of ideas, proposals, and ways.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They fancy that they know all there is to know.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although they dare not claim to be omniscient, they act as if they are omniscient.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is harder to teach them something than it is to feed them bitter medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a man needs to be spoon-fed every meal, how long can he survive?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we meet some brothers, we cannot help but sigh in our heart, "My brother, how many things can a person like you learn from the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The biggest problem with a subjective person is his inability to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This one thing alone can cost him dearly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every time you want such a one to learn something, it seems as if you almost have to fight with him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may beat him down, and he may learn a little.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the next time you want him to learn something, you have to struggle with him all over again.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a great frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One basic requirement of the Lord's worker is being able to remain objective; he has to be so objective that he can readily receive help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers and sisters, our help comes from everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are so many things that we have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose we only learn one lesson a month, or one lesson every half a year, or one lesson a year.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How long can we live?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How many things can we learn in our lifetime?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A subjective person finds it harder to learn as the years go by.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His subjectivity increases as time goes by.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Indeed, subjectivity is a big problem among us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is true that God's worker should be stable; his pathway should be straight and unwavering.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if his opinions, views, and judgments are also set and unyielding, he will have very little chance of learning any lesson, and his usefulness will be very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, we need to be stable and unwavering before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the other hand, we cannot be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God's children should learn to not be subjective; they should learn to be flexible for God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Otherwise, it will be impossible for them to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In order to know whether or not a person is subjective, one only needs to find out whether he learns quickly or slowly, or if he can learn at all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One can tell if a person is subjective by the amount of spiritual things he learns and how often he learns them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The obstacle to learning anything is subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Subjectivity affects a person's ability to learn; it even stops him from learning anything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The basic requirement for spiritual advance is openness to God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our heart, mind, and spirit must be wide open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Being open to Him means that we are not subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The primary meaning of being open is not being subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Of course, in order for our spirit to be open to God, something deeper than not being subjective is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But not being subjective is the first condition.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As soon as we are subjective, our gates are closed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Not being subjective means that we are sensitive to God, that we can learn, and that we can receive impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is hard for many people to receive any impression from God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God has to use a rod or a whip or even a hammer to hit such ones before they receive any impressions from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should learn to understand God's will as soon as His eyes turn.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many people are like horses and mules, who do not understand anything unless they are led by the bit and bridle.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is what it means to be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A subjective person cannot pick up any signal from God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God may wrestle with him and allow him to come to a blind alley or a closed door, yet he is still arguing with God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He cannot quiet himself down to learn what he should learn.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Many people are not meek and pliable enough before God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They are too hard and stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They become a stumbling block to the work because they have not learned much or received much supply from the Lord all their life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They become a problem and a loss to the work.</S>
