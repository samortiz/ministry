   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE SON'S SUBMISSION Scripture Reading: Phil 2:5-11; Heb 5:7-9 THE LORD CREATING SUBMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Word of God tells us that the Lord Jesus and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the beginning was the Word, just as in the beginning there was God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Word was God, and this Word created the heavens and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With God in the beginning there was glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was an inapproachable glory, the glory of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father and the Son are equal, equipotent, coexisting, and existing simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But there is a difference in person between the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not a distinction in intrinsic nature but in arrangement in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible says that the Lord did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped Phil 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be grasped means to take by force.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord's equality with God is not something that He assumed by force.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not an assertion or a usurpation because the Lord had the image of God in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Philippians 2:5-7 form one section, while verses 8-11 form another section.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first section is on Christ emptying Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second section is on Christ humbling Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord lowered Himself twice, first in emptying Himself in His deity, and then in humbling Himself in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord came down to earth, He emptied Himself of the glory, power, position, and image in His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result of His emptying, those without revelation did not recognize Him and would not acknowledge Him as God, considering Him merely as an ordinary man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Godhead the Lord voluntarily chose to be the Son, submitting Himself to the authority of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, He said that the Father was greater than He John 14:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Son's position was a voluntary choice of our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Godhead there is full harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Godhead there is equality, yet it is happily arranged that the Father should be the Head and that the Son should submit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Father became the representation of authority, and the Son became the representation of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are human.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Submission for us is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can submit as long as we humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the Lord's submission is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord's submission is more difficult than His creation of the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to submit He had to empty Himself of all the glory, power, position, and image in His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He also had to take on the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only then could He receive the qualification of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, submission is something created by the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Formerly, the Father and the Son shared the same glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Lord came down to earth, He dropped authority on the one hand and picked up submission on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He set His heart to become a slave, to be restricted in time and space as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord humbled Himself, becoming obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The obedience in the Godhead is the most wonderful thing in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, a painful and shameful death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the end, God exalted Him to the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He that humbles himself will be exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is God's principle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THOSE FILLED WITH CHRIST WILL BE FILLED WITH SUBMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Originally, there was no need for submission in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because the Lord created submission, the Father became the Head to Christ in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both authority and submission were established by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They were present from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, those who know the Lord will be submissive spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Those who do not know God nor Christ will not know authority or submission.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With Christ there is the principle of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who accept submission are accepting the principle of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, those who are filled with Christ will be filled with submission.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today many ask, "Why do I have to submit?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They also ask, "Why do I have to submit to you?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am a brother, and you are a brother."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Actually, men do not have a right to say such things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only the Lord is qualified to speak this way, but He never said such things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There was not even such a thought in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ represents submission, a perfect submission, just as God's authority is perfect authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today some think they know authority, but they do not know submission.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can only ask for God's mercy with such people.</S>
