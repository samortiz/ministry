<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Local Churches in the Various Localities Take God's Eternal Economy as Their Center<br>to Bear the Unique Testimony of Christ</H2><P>In the practice of the church, although there are many local churches, they all take God's eternal economy as their center to bear the unique testimony of Christ. They do not teach any doctrine that is unrelated to God's economy and has nothing to do with the testimony of Christ. In 1 Timothy chapter one Paul wanted Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach things that are different from God's economy (vv. 3-4). In the practice of the church, we should not teach any doctrine that is unrelated to God's economy and has nothing to do with the testimony of Christ. If we do, this will cause division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. In These Local Churches There Should Be Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Spirit as the Reality of the Kingdom of God</H2><P>In the practice of the church there should be righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit in the local churches as the reality of the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17). The kingdom of God is the sphere in which God exercises His authority so that He may express His glory for the fulfillment of His purpose. In such a kingdom, what matters is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. Righteousness denotes that which is right and proper. Those who live in the kingdom of God should be right and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God; with them there should be nothing erroneous, improper, crooked, slanted, or biased. This requires that they be strict in dealing with themselves. Peace is the fruit of righteousness (Heb. 12:11 and note). It characterizes the relationship that those who live in the kingdom of God should have with others and with God. If we are righteous, right, and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God. Thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit and, in particular, before God. In this way, we will be filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:52) and will live out righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, which are the reality of the kingdom of God. This proves that the normal church life is the kingdom of God on the earth today.</P><P>In conclusion, the Lord's recovery has not only the revelation of God but also the God-man life; and the God-man life requires a proper practice of the church. I cannot say that in the church everyone is a God-man, an overcomer; but I can say that in the church the opportunity for us to be a God-man is greater, and it is easier to be an overcomer. This is because in the Lord's recovery, every local church is daily nurturing us to be overcomers, to be God-men. I hope that the elders and the co-workers in every locality will create an environment in the church to nurture the saints to be God-men to live an overcoming life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRESENT URGENT NEEDS<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>In the Lord's recovery there are a few matters that are urgent at the present time to which we should pay special attention. First, every brother and sister needs to ask the Lord for a new revival. Although we have so much vision, we still need to ask the Lord for a new revival. This revival is the God-man life. In every church, we all need to live the God-man life. Whether we are at home or in the workplace, we all need to live the God-man life.</P><P>Second, we need to produce vital groups and endeavor to gain people to be members of the Body of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ. Every member should be living, organic, and not in organization, especially not in arrangement. It is through the vital groups that we all can become the living members in the Body of Christ.</P><P>Third, every brother and sister in the Lord's recovery needs to pursue prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ. We should not make any excuses, saying that we are weak and without strength. Every one of us has the consummated Triune God, who has become the life-giving Spirit, living within us to enable us to pursue prophesying, to speak for the Lord for the building up of the Body of Christ. These are the present urgent needs of the Lord's recovery. I hope that the Lord will be gracious to us so that we can receive these words and actually practice them in our living and in our church.</P>
