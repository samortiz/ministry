   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE GOSPEL IN SCHOOLS 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Propagating the gospel in schools can be compared to fighting on the frontline of a war.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to consider in detail how to fight this war.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many schools are the object of our work, the target of our warfare, so we need to consider how much manpower we can afford to invest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our manpower includes the full-time co-workers, the new full-timers, and the part-time saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These three groups of saints are our manpower; they are also the army to be deployed for the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition to an army, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church can be compared to the headquarters, supplying all the needs in the propagation of the gospel work in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first step in propagating the gospel in the schools is to identify the brothers and sisters who are either staff or students.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do not need to call a big meeting; neither should we draw attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should contact the saints who are staff members or students one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>CONTACTING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should never attempt to take shortcuts in our labor for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not gain any results by taking shortcuts in an attempt to have an easy time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our labor is not to have an easy time but to gain results.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more effective a work is, the more difficulty it will bring.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, a farmer spends a lot of time sowing seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more he labors, the more produce there will be, but the more difficulty he will have.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A work that has no difficulties is a work that has no results.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This can also be compared to running a business.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person who is good at running a business is always busy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person who does not know how to run a business always avoids trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, he has no customers and nothing works.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to propagate the gospel in the schools, we must first contact the saints who are on the teaching staff in the schools and talk with them concerning the situation of the students in their school in order to know whom we can contact.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not take the way of calling a meeting or gathering a crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not arouse the attention of the school, because this might hinder our future work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The principle of our work is for our personnel to contact the students.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are not seeking to increase quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can help the saints, who are either staff or students, by showing them how to approach others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we contact one or two saints a week, in a few weeks we will have fellowshipped with all the saints in a school.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Soon they will all be contacting the students, and over a long period of time our labor will produce results.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Mankind is reproduced one child at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no need to call a big meeting and teach people how to reproduce.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Revival meetings and meetings for cultivating spirituality are the way of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not depend on that way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, we contact people one by one and save people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After we gain one person, we teach him to contact his close friends.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every one of us has several good friends, who become our contacts for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead of seeking to gain many people in a short time, we should work on one person at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This way of laboring seems to be slow, but it is actually rather fast and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way of gaining one person at a time is solid, and the persons gained will be steadfast, remaining fruit John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Trying to gain many people at once can be compared to sewing a garment with eight needles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may desire to be fast, but in the end we accomplish nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is better to sew slowly with one needle and finish the garment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To contact people one by one is a good way to begin the gospel work in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are more likely to succeed by beginning the work in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a school does not have any saints who are students or staff members, we should leave it and begin with another school that has saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is preferable to begin with the schools that have the most saints, either as staff or as students.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After we work on the schools that have saints, we can work on the schools that do not have saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not difficult to labor on a school that does not have saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can wait at the gate of a school at the end of the day and approach the students who are walking out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can greet them, converse with them, give them a gospel tract, and walk with them for a short distance to get to know them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We might not gain anyone today, but we can go again tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After three or four days, we will gain someone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Gradually, by contacting people one by one in this way, the Lord s work will take shape.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must believe that the economical Spirit is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One brother testified that he was saved because an unbeliever said, It is a good thing to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because of this word, the Holy Spirit was able to operate in him, and he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord s Spirit is operating on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our saying that the economical Spirit is with us is absolutely different from what the Pentecostal movement promotes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the 1960s the Pentecostal movement was prevalent in Southeast Asia, and a small number of our saints were affected by Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, the Lord in His sovereignty cleared up that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>History testifies that the Pentecostal movement does not bring in much effect.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For this reason, when we begin the gospel work in the schools, we should treasure contacting people one at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to gain a person so that he takes this way, before we contact a second person.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the way we gain one person, a second person, and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This may seem slow, but it is steady.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no need to draw attention to our work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We simply gain people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After we gain a person, we must have meetings with him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Perhaps a saint who is a teacher lives near the school or a saint who can receive the students lives near the school.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can fellowship with the students in that home.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We can ask the saint, whose home is near the school, whether we can bring some students to his home after school hours.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This gathering should not be long.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If it is long, the students will get home late, and their parents will be worried.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A gathering for thirty minutes would be good.</S>
