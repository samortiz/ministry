<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING SPIRITUAL ATMOSPHERE</h2><p>Question: In my work, I find that there often is the need but that I lack boldness. What is the root of my problem?</p><p>Watchman Nee: Whether or not our work is a success or a failure depends on whether we bring a proper atmosphere to a place or whether the atmosphere in a place affects us. The church in Canton has its own atmosphere. The church in Hong Kong also has its own atmosphere. When we move from Hong Kong to Canton, do we allow the Canton atmosphere to get into us, or do we bring our atmosphere to the church? This is not a performance. We are not drumming up a certain kind of atmosphere purposely. Such promotion is false. Yet at the same time, we cannot passively allow the local atmosphere to affect us. Otherwise, we will be subdued. We have to carry a spirit of freedom with us wherever we go, yet we should not pretend or perform.</p><p>The human body needs fresh air in order to live and move freely. Spiritually speaking, we also need fresh air to feel free and refreshed. Whenever I go to a new place, I always check the spiritual "air" in that place. I try to find out whether the atmosphere is fresh and living. In order to have fresh "air," we have to learn to not offend the Holy Spirit. We must also learn to not offend the atmosphere that is brought in by Him. It is a serious thing to offend the Spirit or the atmosphere brought in by Him.</p><p>We may find that a place has some needs, but feel weak and unable to do anything about them. As a result, the Holy Spirit will not have a spiritual atmosphere in which to release Himself, and this will cause the "air" in that place to be contaminated. If we ignore our feeling of weakness, the Holy Spirit will secure a proper spiritual atmosphere to release Himself. When the atmosphere is right, it is easy to work. Therefore, the first thing we should do when we get to a place is to bring in a proper atmosphere, an atmosphere of the Spirit. Then we can work freely. Let me repeat, however: This is not a performance.</p><p>The first thing we should do when we get to a new place is to ignite the fire of the gospel. We must be armed with a gospel spirit. These things are greatly related to the spiritual atmosphere of a place. In the gospel meetings in Hankow, we had six to eight hundred attendants every day. Brother Lan Tsi-yi reported that as soon as a person stepped into the meeting, he felt a different atmosphere; it was totally different from the world. Many people were subdued the very first day. They confessed their sins with weeping and pleaded for salvation on their knees. We must have a gospel spirit before we can light the gospel fire, but there must be a proper atmosphere before we can light the fire. If the atmosphere is wrong, it is hard to ignite the fire. Our efforts only add to the weight of the burden. We have to ask God again and again to show us if we have offended the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit in any matter. Whether or not we can ignite the gospel fire is a serious matter; it is a test from the Lord. This test will show us that nothing can be done in a casual way. Before we do anything, we must first ask whether or not we have offended the Spirit's atmosphere.</p><p>Let me give another illustration. In one gospel conference, a brother was the song leader during the second meeting. He did not sing well, and the songs were out of tune. Yet the atmosphere of the meeting was wonderful, and dozens and even hundreds of people confessed their sins. On the sixth day the brothers decided to ask this brother to take over the whole meeting. This time it was a failure. He offered a long prayer, and he conducted the singing himself. Afterwards he gave a long message. In the end he sang, gave the altar call, and invited the new ones to write down their names. The result was a fiasco. One brother reported later that only fifteen minutes of the entire meeting had a right spiritual atmosphere.</p><p>We must never say or do anything that offends the spiritual atmosphere. When I first was saved, I conducted a ten-day gospel campaign with some co-workers of mine. I learned many things from that campaign. There were many good confessions from many sinners. Even four beggars were saved in a genuine way.</p><p>Not only do we need the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit in our gospel preaching; we need it in maintaining the church and the work. There is much to learn in this area.</p><p>Miss Betteridge: I have an inward burden to work for the Lord, but I am overwhelmed by the environment. I do not have a co-worker to work together with me, and I cannot find anyone that can pray with me in one accord. As a result, I have become cold and dead.</p>
