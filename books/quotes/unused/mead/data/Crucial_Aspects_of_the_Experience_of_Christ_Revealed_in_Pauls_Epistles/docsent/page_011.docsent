   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX MINGLING, GROWING, AND RENEWING Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6, 11-24 EPHESIANS 3 EXPERIENCING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PRODUCE THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians is a particular book in that it gives us a full revelation of the church and also shows us the way to experience the church, which is to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapters we have seen that Christ is the mystery of God and that the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 3:3 refers to something called the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church comes out of God, who is a mystery, and who is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ also is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even according to history, Christ is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the six thousand years of human history, no one is as mysterious as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was God, yet He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is one person of two natures and two lives human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our mind cannot grasp how one person could have two lives and two natures, how Christ could be God and man at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a mystery, Christ has been embodied in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the church is the mystery of Christ, just as Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Like God and Christ, the church is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most people do not understand what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many think that it is a building with a cross on it, but this is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the church, we are a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a mystery in us, and this mystery is Christ, who is the mystery, the embodiment, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The mystery mentioned in Ephesians 3 includes the unsearchable riches of Christ, which are being dispensed into us v. 8 . Verse 9 calls this dispensing the economy of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Something mysterious is being dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We experience the economy of the mystery daily and hourly as the riches of Christ are dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In every situation and at every moment, while we are eating, washing, and talking to others, Christ is dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The economy of the mystery produces the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church, which comes out of this dispensing, is not material or physical but altogether spiritual and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the expression of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 19 tells us that the church is the fullness of God, the outflowing and overflowing of the riches of God, which result from a constant filling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We Christians have the privilege of being filled with the Triune God until we overflow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To overflow God is to manifest God, to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church as the fullness of God is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is not a physical building but the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because we are constantly filled with God, He overflows from us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The overflowing of God from us is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a group of Christians is not filled with God, they will not overflow or express God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to be Christians who are filled with God so that we are flowing out God in whatever we do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we function in a meeting, God flows out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When all the saints function, the church becomes the fullness of God, God s flowing out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul composed Ephesians 3 with seven main points: the mystery, the unsearchable riches of Christ, the economy of the mystery, the church, Christ making His home in our hearts, the dimensions of Christ, and the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These seven points show us what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church comes out of the mystery, the unsearchable riches of Christ, the economy of the mystery, and Christ making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the church experiences the immeasurable dimensions of Christ, it becomes the fullness, the expression, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>EPHESIANS 4</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>MINGLING, GROWING, AND RENEWING</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 3 can be described by the word rich, and Ephesians 4 can be described by the word deep.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Chapter 4 reveals mingling, growing, and renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need a thorough understanding of what is meant by these three words.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Mingling with the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>to Produce the Church</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verses 4 through 6 mention the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These three are the Triune God, the three-one God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This does not mean that there are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is one God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 4 begins, One Body and one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Body and the Spirit being mentioned together in this way indicates a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord and the Father are also grouped with matters related to the believers to show the Triune God mingled with our being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ephesians 3 reveals the church as the fullness, the outflow, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Chapter 4 goes on to reveal something further that the Triune God mingles Himself with us to cause us to become the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Body, which is the fullness, the expression, and the overflow of God, comes out of God mingling with us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order for the Triune God to mingle with us, we first must believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we call on the Lord, we spontaneously believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By calling on the name of the Lord, faith comes into us, we believe in the Lord, and the Lord enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Immediately, we are joined to the Lord in an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Ephesians 4:5 says, One Lord, one faith, one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are united with Christ, joined to the Lord, by believing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, many worldly things or things of the old creation still hinder us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, we need to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By being baptized, we are freed from the world and cut off from the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are one with the Lord and are members of His Body, which is filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Ephesians 4:6 says, One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Over all refers to the Father as the source, the origin; through all refers to the Son as the course; and in all refers to the Spirit, who abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Triune God is over us, through us, and abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, we are full of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the mingling of the Triune God with the believers, causing the believers to become the fullness of God, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>According to Ephesians 4, the church is produced by God being over all, through all, and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Triune God mingled with us is the genuine church.</S>
