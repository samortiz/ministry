   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SEVEN THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF JUSTIFICATION 1 THE EXPERIENCE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 4 is a deep chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not understand it just in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we enter into the depths of this chapter, we will see it reveals that adequate, living justification is God s deeper work in calling fallen people out of everything other than God and bringing them back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God created man for Himself and to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The meaning of the fall of man is to be kept from God by anything that is not God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The man who had been created to God fell away from God to other things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It does not matter whether a thing is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as it is not God and it keeps man from God, it constitutes a fall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In God s justification, God calls the fallen man out of everything back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, when God called Abraham, He did not tell him where he should go, because His intention was to bring Abraham back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moment after moment and step after step, Abraham s heart had to cleave to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He had to trust in God for every move, not leaving His presence for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, Abraham had to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After God called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees, God trained Abraham to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we have seen, believing in God means to believe into God and to make ourselves one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this kind of believing, a man admits that he is nothing, that he has nothing, and that he can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He agrees that he must be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, believing in God means to terminate ourselves and to let God be our very being, to let God be all that we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the time we first believe in Him, we should not be anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should be completely terminated and allow God to be everything in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the accurate meaning of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is inadequate even to ask the Lord to circumcise our heart, for the deep and adequate circumcision is to terminate yourself and allow God to be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a person has been called by God in this way, the living God transfuses Himself into him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This word transfuse is important in describing what transpires at God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The living God spontaneously transfuses Himself into the called one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a result, he is attracted by God and to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unconsciously, some element, some essence of the living God is transfused into him, and he reacts to God by believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This reaction is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you heard the gospel of glory regarding the Lord Jesus, you repented.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that God called you out of everything other than Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that moment, without your even knowing it, the living Christ in His gospel of glory transfused Himself into you 2 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some element of Christ penetrated your being, and you were attracted to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You reacted to Him, and your spontaneous reaction was your believing, your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Christ who transfused Himself into you became your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, faith does not originate with us; it comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Faith is not separate from Christ, for it is actually Christ Himself transfusing Himself into us and producing a reaction within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our believing is an echo.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can there be an echo without a sound?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is the sound.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When this sound reaches our heart and spirit it causes a reaction, an echo.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This reaction is our appreciation of and faith in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This faith is actually Christ Himself within us responding to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, this faith is reckoned to us by God as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Christ transfused Himself into you, there was a reaction within you believing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After you believed in the Lord, God reacted to you, reckoning your faith, which is Christ, as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not find this experience in the Bible if we read superficially, but if we probe into the depths of the Scriptures, we find it there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is as if God said to us, Poor sinner, you don t have righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As I, the living God, am speaking with you, My essence is being transfused into you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will cause you to react to Me in faith, and I will reckon this faith to you as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When God does this to us, we have an appreciative and loving reaction toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This reaction is our faith, a faith that does not originate with us, but which is the essence of the living Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This faith returns to God, causing a reaction in God toward us: the righteousness of God is reckoned as ours, and we have something that we never had before.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is our experience of God in justification.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus, we have the righteousness of God, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Isaac was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Abraham, our believing father, received the righteousness of God and Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Likewise, we have received both the righteousness of God and Christ, the present Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is an experience of God calling things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we came to God on the day we were saved, we had nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Nevertheless, God appeared to us and called things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Formerly, we did not have the righteousness of God; after a few minutes we had it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Before that time, we did not have Christ; after a few minutes we had Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once we have an experience of the righteousness of God and Christ, we will guard it as a priceless treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We will proclaim, I have the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, one day God will intervene and say, Offer this on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Will you do it?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not one out of a hundred Christians is willing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead they say, O Lord, don t ask me to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I would do anything else, but not this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Nevertheless, we must remember the reactions which go back and forth between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The righteousness of God and Christ are ours these came as God s reaction to our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Now we must return this reaction to God by offering it to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After we react in this way, God will react again.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God s first reaction was to call things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>His second reaction is to give life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>According to Romans 4, the ultimate issue of this series of reactions is the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This resurrected Christ is now in the heavens as a strong proof that God has been satisfied and that we have been justified.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The resurrected Christ is in the third heavens at the right hand of God as conclusive evidence that all of God s requirements have been satisfied and that we have been thoroughly and adequately justified.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, this resurrected Christ is not only in the heavens, but also within us to impart life that we may have a life of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Therefore, justification is not merely a positional matter; it becomes a dispositional matter.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The death of Christ gave us a positional justification, and the resurrected Christ in the heavens is a proof of this.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Now the resurrected Christ also lives inside us, reacting within us and living out a life of dispositional justification.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Eventually, we are justified both in position and in disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We not only have an objective justification, but a subjective justification as well.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We may now live such a subjective, dispositional justification.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This justification is the real, living circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What is circumcision?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Circumcision means to terminate ourselves and to come into God: it terminates us and it germinates God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Jews do not care for the inward reality of circumcision; they only care for the outward form, the practice of cutting off a piece of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is not circumcision in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In God s eyes, circumcision means to cut off yourself, terminate yourself, and allow God to germinate Himself within you to be your life that you may have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This circumcision is the outward seal of the real, inward justification.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Abraham experienced God as the One who calls things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>By the birth of Isaac Abraham experienced God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Furthermore, by the resurrection of Isaac, Abraham experienced God as the One who gives life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There are two kinds of Isaac: the first is Isaac born; the second is Isaac resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The God in whom Abraham believed had these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He believed in the God who calls things not being as being and who gives life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Regardless of who we are or of what situation in which we find ourselves, the general human condition is one of not being.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This means that nothing exists.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The second general condition of everyone and everything is deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Thus, the overall situation of man has two aspects nothingness and deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The actual condition of us all is nothingness and deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But the God in whom our father Abraham believed and in whom we also believe is the God who calls things into existence out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When we say, Nothing, He says, Something.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When we say, Not being, He says, Being.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Do not say that the church in a certain place is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It may be poor in your eyes, but not in the eyes of the God in whom Abraham believed.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>God may tell you, You say nothing exists.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>After one minute, I will call something into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Suppose the person of James Barber did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If God wanted a James Barber, He would simply call, James Barber, and James Barber would come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This means that God calls things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>When God told Abraham, Your seed shall be as the stars of heaven, nothing existed at that time as far as the descendants of Abraham were concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>There was not even one descendant.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Nevertheless, God made such a declaration regarding Abraham s seed, and Abraham believed.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Approximately a year later, Abraham s first descendant came into being: Isaac was born.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>By the birth of Isaac Abraham experienced God as the One who calls things not being as being.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>However, this is only half of the experience of God, for Abraham also experienced God as the One who gives life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When Abraham received Isaac back after offering him to God on the altar, he experienced God giving life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>A church may exist in a certain locality, but be quite dead.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Do not be quick to make a judgment, because God gives life to the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>When a church is dead, it provides an excellent opportunity for the God in whom Abraham believed to enter in and impart life to that dead church.</S>
