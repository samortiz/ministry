   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 42:"Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we connect verses 40 and 41 to verse 42, we can see that the distinction lies in being watchful or not being watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If this were not the only distinction, the Lord would not use "therefore" and also would not warn us to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the condition for the rapture were based merely on regeneration and not on the watchfulness and work after regeneration, there would be no reason for the Lord to exhort us to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse the Lord did not entreat us to repent, to believe in the Lord, to be regenerated; He charged us only to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, we know that in verses 40 through 42, those taken and those left behind are all saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord cannot charge those who are not regenerated to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What does it mean to be watchful?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some say that to be watchful is a matter for the Jews, and that we Christians need only to wait and do not need to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But even if the Jews are watchful, they still must pass through the great tribulation; they can never escape God's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They must pass through the time of Jacob's distress Jer 30:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It cannot be that because of their watchfulness the great tribulation will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the church needs to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The meaning of being watchful is to not be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christians are often too self-confident.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Being watchful is in contrast to being careless.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who sleep must be those who are self-confident, for they think that nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who watch must be those who do not trust in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If one is self-confident, there is the possibility that he may fall.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Or if one says, "I am not the same as before," failure is near.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is only when you feel that you are lacking and cannot be depended on that you will be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Being watchful means being careful, not careless, every day on the alert against the possibility of stumbling.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All those who consider that they themselves will not stumble cannot be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If everyone will be raptured, then there is no need to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason that Christians must be watchful is that we do not know when the Lord will come.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we knew, then we would not need to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But since the Lord did not let us know, there must be a group of people who are the real watchers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the theory that all believers will be raptured is not one to be depended on.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 43:"But know this, that if the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Under the subject of the rapture, four parables are used to expound the Lord's parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, these four parables are actually parables concerning the parousia; they explain verse 42.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Beginning from verse 43, what the Lord says is fully for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verses 4 through 31 answer the first question; verses 32 through 42 answer the second question.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The disciples did not even understand the questions they asked, but the Lord is a good teacher for He answered more than what they asked.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The parable of the sheep and the goats points to the things of the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1 The house, 2 the householder, 3 the thief, 4 the stealing what do all these refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1 The house means the dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It refers to the work of the saints after they believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The "house" in Hebrews 3:6 is the house of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mark 13:34 refers to the house of the Lord, in which we are all doorkeepers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew 7 refers to the work of the believers to build a house v. 24 . 2 Since the house refers to our behavior, the householder should be us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3 The thief is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>4 The thief comes to steal things, to cause the householder to suffer some loss.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But the Lord comes to make the householder gain a greater blessing see 1 Thes 5:2; 2 Pet 3:10; Rev 3:3; 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Usually, we do not know who the thief is, but the Lord is the Thief who informed us in advance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only so, but the Lord steals in the daytime "in the field" and "at the mill" both signify in the daytime.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a thief steals something, he brings it to his own house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord also steals something and brings it to the throne to His own place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Would not have allowed his house to be broken into."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If something has been stolen, this means that the house has been broken into.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If nothing has been stolen, the house has not been broken into.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A thief steals the good things and takes them away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The bad things are left behind by the thief.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then the householder suffers a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is most regrettable that today many Christians are prepared to be left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First Thessalonians 5:4-10 says that our position is that of the sons of light; thus, we should not let the Lord come as a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"And you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you" Rev 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the church is like the believers in Thessalonica, they are the sons of light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the church is like Sardis corrupted Protestantism with its dead works, the Lord will come upon it as a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"You shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church in Sardis does not know when the Lord will come upon her.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The householder had his house broken into, but he himself was left.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This was his own fault, because every head of a household should know beforehand that a thief will come; the prophecy informs him of this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After the Lord left this world, it became a long, dark night that is, moral, spiritual darkness .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our position is that although we do not know at what hour He will come, we do know that in this long night the Lord will come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not know at what hour He will come, so we should always take this ignorance as a motivation for being watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should compensate for our ignorance by our watchfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The failure of the householder is that he despised what he knew and did not compensate for what he did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should always be watchful toward the enemy, the world, and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis said that we should be watchful from the very first day of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To the Jews, the rapture will be a sign; to those believers who will have been left behind, it will be the coming of the suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The previous verses, verses 4-31, should be explained literally.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For example, "those days" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>19, 22, 29 are all explained literally.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But "those days" refer to a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The "things" in verse 17 are material.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In verse 43, the "house" is spiritual and has to do with the church the parable of the thief refers to the church .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The parousia will be like lightning to the Jews after the tribulation ; it will be like a thief to the church.</S>
