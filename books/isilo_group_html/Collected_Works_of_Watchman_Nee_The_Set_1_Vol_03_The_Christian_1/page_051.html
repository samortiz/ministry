The Lord Jesus was resurrected on the first of the seven days which is the eighth day. Noah was the eighth person (2 Pet. 2:5)-there were eight souls in his family (1 Pet. 3:20). They came out from the ark (death), and they multiplied over the new land which was once covered by the flood. God ordained Abraham to circumcise every manchild on the eighth day after birth (Gen. 17:11-14); circumcision means "putting off of the body of the flesh" (Col. 2:11). It is the same as saying we are God's workmanship created in Christ Jesus (Eph. 2:10). David was Jesse's eighth son (1 Sam. 16:10-11); he established a new nation of Israel. A man with leprosy was cleansed on the eighth day (Lev. 14:10, 23); this was to declare that he was a new man from that day on. A sheaf of the firstfruits was waved before the Lord on the eighth day, the day after the Sabbath (Lev. 23:11). Then fifty days later the feast of Pentecost was kept (v. 16), which signifies the coming of the Holy Spirit and the beginning of a new generation. The feast of tabernacles lasted seven days, and on the eighth day there was a holy convocation (v. 36). The feast of tabernacles typifies the millennial kingdom. Therefore, the holy convocation typifies God's new rest after the millennial kingdom. There were seven days for the cleansing of the priest until the eighth day when he entered his new duties (Lev. 9:1). The children of Israel resowed their land in the eighth year (Lev. 25:22). The eighth Psalm speaks of the Lord's kingdom (cf. Heb. 2:5-9). The Lord Jesus went up to the mountain and was transfigured on the eighth day (Luke 9:28). This typifies His power and His coming (2 Pet. 1:16-18). There are six letters in the word "Jesus" in the original language, and every letter in Greek has a numerical value; "Jesus" has a total numerical value of eight hundred eighty-eight. The disciples were gathered together on the first day of seven days, which is the eighth day, to break bread (Acts 20:7). This is a new meeting day. The disciples were instructed to give their offerings on the first day of seven days, which is the eighth day (1 Cor. 16:1-2). This is not the practice of the Old Testament. The eighth head of the beast came out of the resurrection of the seventh (Rev. 17:11). The original evil spirit takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, which is eight all together, and they enter into the heart of one who does not receive the Lord Jesus (Matt. 12:43, 45). In Daniel, the fourth beast had ten horns of which three fell and seven were left; then a little one came out, which was the eighth horn, and it renewed the blasphemy against God (Dan. 7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Ten</H2><P>Ten is the number of earthly completion; it is two times five, indicating man's complete responsibility before God. A complete man has ten fingers and ten toes and can work and walk. When man rebelled, God used ten plagues to punish the Egyptians. When the power of the Gentiles rises to its peak, there will be ten nations. The Bible uses ten toes and ten horns to typify them (Dan. 2; 7:7; Rev. 17:12). There are the ten commandments for Israel to bear responsibility before God. Ephraim, which stands for the ten tribes of the kingdom of Israel, should bear its own responsibility before God; it was not joined with Judah. After the resurrection of Christ, He appeared ten times on earth. What a big responsibility for those who knew that He had resurrected! The church in Smyrna suffered ten days on the earth (Rev. 2:10). The disciples prayed for ten days (Acts 1), then they received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Christians in the end times are likened unto ten virgins (Matt. 25:1-2). However, among them, five are foolish and five wise. Man should bear his responsibility until the Bridegroom comes back. The woman has ten pieces of silver (Luke 15:8) which represents all the people in the world who belong to God. (Initially, it only represents the children of Israel.) Ten servants were delivered ten minas to do business until the Lord comes back (Luke 19:13). They should not be careless with what they have received. The first servant was awarded ten cities because he gained ten minas. God asked the children of Israel to offer a tenth. Therefore, God divided what the children of Israel possessed into ten minas. God took one part, indicating His esteemed greatness. In the tabernacle on earth, ten is the number used most often; the same is true with the temple of Solomon, and the coming temple of which Ezekiel prophesied. This is because they were on the earth. Please read Exodus 26 and 27, 1 Kings 6, and Ezekiel 40.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 03, The Christian (1) &nbsp; pg 51</div><br></body></html>
