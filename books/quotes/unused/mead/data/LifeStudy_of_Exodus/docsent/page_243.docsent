   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SEVENTY-TWO THE IMPLICATIONS, INDICATIONS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND SIGNIFICANCES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE ORDINANCES OF THE LAW 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 22:29-31; 23:10-12, 14-19</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing message we considered a number of points related to how to live in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We saw that we need to offer the fullness of our harvest of Christ and the outflow of our experience of the cross; that as those redeemed through Christ as our Substitute, we should be separated unto God; that we should be saturated with Christ as our holiness to become holy men unto God; and that we should not eat anything of death, but take only Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, we saw that we need to care for others and supply them with food by taking Christ as our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Finally, we saw that keeping feasts unto God three times a year typifies the full enjoyment of the Triune God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we must go on to cover some supplementary matters related to the keeping of the three feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>XIX.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE BLOOD OF GOD S SACRIFICE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>NOT BEING OFFERED WITH LEAVENED BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SIGNIFYING THAT CHRIST S REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>SHOULD BE SEPARATED FROM OUR SINFUL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Exodus 23:18 and 19 give us four supplementary ordinances for the keeping of the feasts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, verse 18 says, Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a warning not to mix Christ s redemption with our sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the people came to the feast, they were not allowed to mix the blood of the sacrifice with leavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that we should not mix Christ s redemption with our sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The blood of the sacrifice signifies the redemption of Christ, and leavened bread signifies our sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These two things must never be put together.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to enjoy Christ s redemption, we must be separated from our sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>XX.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE FAT OF GOD S FEAST CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>NOT REMAINING UNTIL THE MORNING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>SIGNIFYING THAT THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SHOULD BE FOR OUR ENJOYMENT WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>TODAY, NOT TOMORROW</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Exodus 23:18 also says, Neither shall the fat of my feast remain until the morning lit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>. According to this verse, the fat of God s feast Christ should not remain until morning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This signifies that the riches of Christ should be for our enjoyment with God today, not tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As Christians we should enjoy Christ today and not put off this enjoyment until tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>XXI.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE FIRST OF THE FIRSTFRUITS BROUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD TYPIFYING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CHRIST AS THE FIRSTFRUIT BEING BROUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TO GOD S DWELLING PLACE FOR HIS SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Exodus 23:19 says, The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God lit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>. According to this verse, the first of the firstfruits were to be brought into the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This typifies Christ as the firstfruit 1 Cor 15:20, 23 being brought to God s dwelling place for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This verse does not speak merely of the firstfruits; it speaks of the first of the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, there may be firstfruits of both peaches and almonds.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The almonds, however, may ripen first.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This would make the almonds the first of the firstfruits, which should be brought to the temple, God s house, for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that in our experience and enjoyment of Christ we should have not only the top experience, but even the topmost of the top experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This aspect of our experience of Christ should be brought directly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No one else should be allowed to enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes if we share certain experiences of Christ with others before presenting these experiences to God, we cause our experiences to become common.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At other times, we may think that a certain experience of Christ is a topmost experience when it is actually quite ordinary and common.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Any experience of Christ that is truly a topmost experience should be kept in secret and then brought to God s temple and offered directly to God for His satisfaction.</S>
