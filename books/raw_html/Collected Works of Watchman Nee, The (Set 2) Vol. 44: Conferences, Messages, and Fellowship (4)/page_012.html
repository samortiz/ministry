<h2 class="head2">Isaiah 14:12-20</h2><p>Isaiah 14:12-20 also gives us some facts about Satan. Verses 12 through 14 describe his past, while verses 15 through 20 tell us his present condition.</p><p>Verse 12 says, "How you have fallen from heaven,/O Daystar, son of the dawn!/How you have been hewn down to earth,/You who made nations fall prostrate!" "Daystar" refers to the morning stars mentioned in Job 38:7. The phrase "son of the dawn" refers to the fact that he was the first one created in the whole universe.</p><p>Verses 13 and 14 say, "But you, you said in your heart:/I will ascend to heaven;/Above the stars of God/I will exalt my throne./And I will sit upon the mount of assembly/On the sides of the north./I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;/I will be like the Most High." He said "I will" five times. This was the cause of his fall. This was not just a matter of the heart but a matter of the will. The "heaven" in verse 13 is different from the "heaven" in verse 12. The "heaven" in verse 12 is in contrast to earth, whereas the "heaven" in verse 13 is above "the heights of the clouds." This is God's administrative center, the place where God conducts His business. Satan's goal is to be God. He was higher than all the archangels already (Jude 9), yet he was not satisfied with this. He wanted to be equal with God.</p><p>Genesis 1:1-2 speaks of God's judgment on the world at that time. When one-third of the angels rebelled with Satan, there was a change in the universe, and God executed great judgment upon it. Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Heaven includes not only heaven but also the angels. After God judged the rebellious Satan, the earth became without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.</p><p>The first world that God created was good (Job 38:7; Isa. 45:18), because God is not a God of confusion (1 Cor. 14:33). Yet the earth became without form and void through God's judgment (Jer. 4:23-26). The Bible shows us that the earth is the center of the universe. In the future, everything will happen on the earth. We can say that the earth is the center stage of the universe.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S PERMISSIVE WILL</h2><p>Due to Satan's rebellion, the earth has become marred with sin, and heaven is also tainted with sin. According to Leviticus 16:14-15, when the priests offered the sin offering for the propitiation of sin, they had to bring the blood into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle it before the propitiation cover. Hebrews 9:24-26 tells us that Christ has entered the tabernacle not made with hands, the heavenly tabernacle, and has offered up Himself as the sacrifice. According to Colossians 1:20, the extent of propitiation or redemption is not limited to the earth; it includes heaven as well. Even heaven itself needs to be redeemed. According to Isaiah 30:26, the sun is tainted with sin and will be healed and restored to its original state. Of course, the earth has suffered the greatest judgment from God. God's explicit will is seen in Ephesians 1:10, which is to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth. His dealing with Satan through man is according to His permissive will.</p>
