   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Principle of Owning Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Anything that you do not have complete ownership of does not necessarily have to be handed over.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These items are the property of your husband or your family members.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Household decorations and ornaments can be retained as long as they are tasteful and not too extravagant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Follow the principle of keeping what is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is all right to keep things that are reasonable and tasteful, but it is wrong to go beyond this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Objects like ivory antiques should not be kept for display in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These things do not have any practical value.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to carefully consider what we want to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It may be better to use the money to print or purchase gospel tracts instead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A certain brother loved to collect ivory antiques before he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He loved them so much that he would sleep with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Others talk to their wives before going to bed; this brother looked at his antiques before going to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He loved his wife, but that love could not match his love for his antiques.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every night he looked at his antiques until midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When he woke up he fondled them for another two or three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But thank God, the Lord saved him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After he was delivered from these things, he declared, "The Lord has taken away my love for ivory antiques.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These objects are beautiful, but the Lord has saved me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a release it is to be delivered from these antiques!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that no useless, valuable objects would be found in a Christian's home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have the financial means, we can buy something practical and tasteful, but a Christian should not collect expensive antiques in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A sister consecrated her piano, and two other sisters consecrated their sewing machines.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The piano can be stored in the meeting hall; we can use it at a later date.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sewing machines can also be stored in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the future we can make them available to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am not saying that it is wrong to have items such as a piano or sewing machine in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if others do not have them, it is not good for us to have them just for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When everyone has them, it is quite all right for us to have them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christians do not practice asceticism; they practice the denial of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When all the brothers and sisters have these things, I will have them, but I should not be so impatient that I must have them immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Dealing with the Lust for Shopping</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The greatest temptation facing housewives is shopping or the habit of shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some objects are acquired only because the eyes need them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are good to look at, but the husband and family have no need of them, even though the eyes have need of them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more she buys, the more closet and drawer space she needs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, she runs out of space for the things she needs; all the spaces are filled with objects that only satisfy the lust of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One sister bought a bed sheet which she did not use for four or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She bought a dozen stockings which she kept unused in her closet for a year.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This puts money in a dead place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A housewife must overcome the lust of shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Otherwise, she will want to buy what she likes when there is some money in her pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a buying lust.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She buys something only for the purpose of looking at it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the lust of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She has to overcome this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When she stands in front of a department store with money in her pocket, she should ask, "Am I about to buy something practical and useful, or is it only for display?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A Christian should always reject the lust of buying.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Except for meeting some immediate need, we should not buy anything too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Cutting Our Expenses for the Gospel's Sake</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The housewives should discuss with their husbands how much they should spend a month and how much pocket money should be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After taking care of the normal expenses, all excess should be saved and offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This does not mean that a housewife has to lower the quality of the food.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It means that she should save what can be saved in order to offer it to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She should not neglect proper nutrition for her husband and children.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If she has too many garments, she should sell some.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Any dress that is too nice should be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She should not live in rags, but neither should she be overly adorned.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A housewife always should have a seasonal clean-up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She should consider how much can be saved and how much can be given away.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is best to designate a specific amount of offering for the gospel each month.</S>
