<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE GOSPEL IN SCHOOLS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>There are close to eight hundred saints who are burdened for the work in the schools. This is unprecedented among us. We rejoice that the saints are burdened to focus on the gospel work. We must fellowship and pray together concerning the way to advance in the gospel work in the junior high schools, high schools, and colleges.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>According to statistics, in Taipei there are about one hundred schools that are either junior high school, high school, or college. If we count only the colleges with a day curriculum, there are twenty-one colleges with about one hundred ten thousand students. If we include the students in junior high school and high school, there are a total of three hundred and seventy thousand students. This means that in the city of Taipei alone, there are three hundred and seventy thousand young people between the ages of twelve and twenty-two. We are in a big fishpond! This is a great matter. With regard to spreading the gospel, this is an unprecedented opportunity in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. With regard to the environment, we thank the Lord for giving us a country that is thriving in every aspect. This country has good security, a calm society, and advanced education. The government grants much freedom to the church and does not interfere with the gospel. The past two thousand years of history show that the gospel, the truth, and the church are a great help to any country or society. Whenever the gospel, the truth, and the church enter a country or a society, they bring in blessing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the propagation of the gospel is aided by the availability of education in Taiwan. When Western missionaries went to China to preach the gospel a hundred years ago, the first problem they encountered was the lack of knowledge among the people, because education was not available. Therefore, most people could carry on a general conversation only about simple things. It was difficult for a person to talk about deeper things. Not many people were educated, and the schools were mostly private. Thus, when Western missionaries went to China to preach the gospel, their preaching was restricted by the ignorance of the people. This forced the missionaries to establish schools.</p>
<p>Today the educational standard in Taiwan is very high. Most Westerners are aware of the fact that the Taiwanese people pay attention to education and that all the parents push their children to study hard. There are also many advertisements in the newspapers for additional help in all kinds of subjects. In fact, education has nearly become an idol in Taiwan. This higher educational standard is a great help to the spread of the truth of the gospel. We do not have to labor to establish schools like the Western missionaries. The church in Taipei has been here for thirty-five years, and the number of saints in the church life is close to seven thousand with around three to four thousand in regular attendance. We can say that the church is full of resources.</p>
<p>We have three hundred seventy thousand &ldquo;fish&rdquo; around us, and many saints are burdened for the gospel in the schools. This standard of education and the backing of the church are our &ldquo;capital.&rdquo; With this &ldquo;capital,&rdquo; we need to spend time to study a scientific way to preach the gospel in the schools. In the past we distributed gospel tracts at the gate of a school and smiled even when we were mocked. Although this conduct was noble and we could say we had the Spirit of Christ, our method was primitive. It was not scientific. In every aspect the world is improving and progressing even in the way companies package their products. In the earlier days fruit stores used old newspaper to wrap their products for their customers, but today the packaging is very refined. Preaching the gospel like we did thirty-five years ago is an indication that the church has fallen behind the times.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH BEING UNCHANGEABLE<br />
BUT THE METHODS OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
BEING CHANGEABLE</h2>
<p>We can never change the truth in the Bible, but there is room for change in the way we preach and spread the gospel. Before the nineteenth century, there were no trains or steam ships. There were only wagons on the land and sailboats in the water. In the 1930s I was laboring in northern China. When I was preparing to travel to the inland area with several co-workers to preach the gospel, the Sino-Japanese war broke out following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, and the entire country was thrust into a state of preparing for war. All domestic trains were stopped. In order to travel to the inland area, we had to use an ox cart. We set off at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, but by nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening we had covered less than thirty miles. With all the jolting and tossing on the way, my joints were quite sore by the time we arrived at our destination. Nowadays a direct flight from Los Angeles to Taipei takes only twelve hours, and the journey by plane is smooth. This is an indication of the improvement in the means of transportation. We cannot change the shape of the earth, but we can improve the means of transportation. This is the age of science in which everything should progress. Therefore, the way we preach the gospel and spread the truth should also progress.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
