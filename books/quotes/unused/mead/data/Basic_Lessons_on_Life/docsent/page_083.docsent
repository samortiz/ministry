   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR SPIRIT NEEDING TO BE STIRRED UP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Beginning from this point, we need to see what our spirit should do.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ezra 1:1 says that the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then verse 5 says that God stirred up the spirit of a remnant of Israelites to go up to build His house in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our spirit needs to be stirred up for God's interest cf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Exo 35:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not wait for others to stir up our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, we should stir up our spirit by exercising our spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 Tim 1:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, the Lord is the One who stirs our spirit up, but we should not be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We ourselves have to cooperate with the Lord to stir up our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>V. OUR SPIRIT NEEDING TO BE BURNING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our spirit needs to be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 12:11 charges us to be burning in spirit, and Acts 18:25 tells us that Apollos was fervent, burning, in spirt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OUR SPIRIT INDWELT BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>NEEDING TO BE THE FACULTY OF OUR PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Prayer is the way to exercise our spirit, but many Christians do not pray with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They pray by using merely their mouth and their mentality with their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not use their spirit when they pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If one person asks another person to do something for him, he might simply open up his mouth according to his mentality and his emotion without exercising his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Christians today pray to the Lord in exactly the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They do not use their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the past we prayed many times without exercising our spirit, but Ephesians 6:18 says that we need to pray at every time in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to use our spirit as the faculty of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot hear things by exercising our eyes or smell things by using our ears.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must use the proper faculty to hear and to smell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, we have to pray by exercising our spirit as the proper faculty of our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The faculty for us to pray is not our mind or emotion but our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more we stress this, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many saints and young ones among us need to learn how to use their spirit in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A good illustration of using the spirit is when a person loses his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When he loses his temper and yells, he is not using his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that point, he is in his real person, that is, his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not yell from our spirit, our yelling is a false performance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The real yelling surely comes out of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, this is a negative example, because when one loses his temper his spirit comes forth in a cruel and rude way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in principle, we have to learn to use our spirit in prayer in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever we open up our mouth, we should exercise our spirit to utter something.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever we pray, we should pray in our spirit, using our spirit to say something to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit needs to be the faculty of our prayer.</S>
