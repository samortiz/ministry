<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Partake of the Lord's Table</H2><P>The Lord's table is a feast. First Corinthians 10:21b uses the term the Lord's table. We must tell the saints that the table here means the feast. We come to the Lord's table to enjoy a feast.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Eat the Lord's Supper</H2><P>First Corinthians 11:20 refers to our eating the Lord's supper. This is not a breakfast or a lunch, but a supper, a dinner. When the Lord established the table, He did it in the evening of the Passover, so it was a supper.</P><P>Here we must stress that the Lord's table is not only a feast but also a supper. A feast is mainly a kind of enjoyment, and a supper is a kind of restful eating. After a day's work, after a day's labor, people restfully eat their supper. Thus, we come to the Lord's table not only to enjoy it as a feast, but also to take it restfully. After we eat breakfast, we labor, but the Lord's table is a supper for us to rest. No labor is implied here, but rest. Generally speaking, supper does not imply any kind of work, any kind of labor, or any intention to work. Supper indicates that the work is over, and now is the time for rest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. To Remember the Lord</H2><P>Here we must say a strong word to correct a wrong concept. Many Christians think that to have the Lord's table is to remember His death. This is wrong. We are not going to remember the death, but we are going to remember the Lord Himself. The Lord told us to do this in remembrance of Him, not of His death. We remember the Person, the Lord Himself. This is the central point of the Lord's table meeting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Focus of the Lord's Table</H2><P>The Lord's table meeting is to remember the Lord, so any hymns, testimonies, or messages that distract people from the Lord, the Person, are not appropriate. In the Lord's table meeting, someone may call a hymn on fighting the battle, or in the midst of the Lord's table, someone may give a testimony of how he was rescued from his suffering. That might be good in another kind of meeting, but it is not fitting at the Lord's table meeting. A brother may come to the Lord's table with a good verse which he enjoyed in his time of morning revival. He might come with that good verse to give people a good teaching concerning repentance and salvation. This is wrong. Such a teaching is not for the Lord's table meeting but for a gospel-preaching meeting. The Lord's table meeting is concentrated on the Person of the Lord, so all the hymns, all the praises, and all the speaking should be concentrated on the Lord Himself. All distractions from the focus of the Lord's table should be avoided.</P>
