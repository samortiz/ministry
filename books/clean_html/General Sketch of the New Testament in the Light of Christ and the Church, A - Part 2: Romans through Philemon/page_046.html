<h2 class=head2>The New Man with Christ as Life and the Body as His Fullness</h2><p>Now we may see some of the details of the different aspects of the church. When a man is born, he has a human life. If we did not have the human life, we could not be a man. That the church is the new man means that the church has a new life, and this new life is Christ. Christ is life to us because He is the very embodiment of the Father and is realized as the Spirit. This life, therefore, is the Triune God, who is typified by the tree of life. Originally, we were the old man because we had only the old life, the created life of man, but through Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection He has regenerated us. Regeneration is simply the imparting of the Triune God into us. Through the processes of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection the Triune God has imparted Himself into us as life. Now we have a new life, the divine life. This life is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit. In this way we become the new man.<p>Moreover, this new man is the Body. The new man is a matter of life, while the Body is a matter of expression. Without a body a person can have no expression; no one could know him or recognize him. We are known and recognized by our body as our expression. That the church is the Body of Christ means that it is the very expression of Christ, and Christ is the life within the church.<p>The Body is the fullness of Christ. A head without a body is poor; it is without a fullness. Similarly, a disjointed body is not the fullness of the head. Only a proper body is the complete fullness of the head. In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus is the Head without the Body. Therefore, in the Gospels there is no fullness of Christ. In the book of Acts, however, Jesus is duplicated thousands of times. Hence, in Acts we can see the fullness of Christ. The church is composed of many members, and every member is a duplication, a living copy, of Jesus. These living members composed together form the Body.<p>The Body is the very expression of Christ, just as a person’s physical body is his expression. This Body is also the fullness. Ephesians 1:23 does not speak of the fullness of Christ, the fullness of the Son of God, or the fullness of the Lord Jesus; it speaks of the fullness of the One who fills all in all. It is difficult to understand what the fullness is; this is too profound and our understanding is too limited. We also cannot explain how Christ fills all things. We can only say that this term shows how great Christ is. Today His fullness is a universal fullness because as the One who fills all in all He is unlimitedly great. He fills not only all but all in all. Christ is unlimited, and such an unlimited Christ needs a universal Body to be His fullness. Although the church on the earth may sometimes appear to be a mess, it is still in the principle of the fullness of Christ. Christ is in the United States, Europe, Africa, Asia, and in every place on the earth. The church as the Body is the universal fullness of Christ in both space and time.<h2 class=head2>The Counterpart of Christ</h2><p>This fullness is also the counterpart of Christ, just as Eve was a counterpart to Adam to match Adam. That a wife is one with her husband typifies that the church is one with Christ; this is the great mystery in Ephesians 5:32. A husband and wife are like two halves of a watermelon. When the two halves are put together, they become a whole. One half needs the other half to match it. In the same way, the church is a part of Christ, the counterpart of Christ, to match Him. A wife is the fullness of the husband; in Genesis 2 Eve is both the counterpart and fullness of Adam. When Adam was a bachelor, he had no fullness, but when he was given a wife to match him as his counterpart, she became his fullness. Hence, the church in life and nature is one with Christ. The two have one life and one nature, so the church becomes a part of Christ to match Christ.
