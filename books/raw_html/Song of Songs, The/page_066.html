<p>“Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.” Solomon will have his share as well. The one thousand pieces of silver are the account that we have to give to the Lord. This is different from what is recorded in Luke 19 and Matthew 25. There we see a difference based on our gifts. Here the one thousand pieces of silver are what each keeper should give to the Lord. When we stand before the judgment seat, the Lord has a minimum requirement for each one of us. This requirement is the one thousand pieces of silver here.</p><p>Verse 12 says, “My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.” The maiden now separates herself from the other keepers. She is not an ­ordinary keeper of the vineyards of Solomon. Solomon gave her a vineyard once; therefore, she has her own vineyard. This vineyard is now “before me,” which means that the vineyard is hers (Gen. 13:9) and that it is under her direction. According to righteousness, the keepers should pay Solomon a thousand pieces of silver. According to love, should she do less than what the law requires? Of course not! She should give Solomon a thousand pieces of silver. Here we see two kinds of services. Some serve according to the law, whereas others serve according to love. Some serve out of fear, where­as others serve out of gratitude. Some serve as a duty, whereas others serve as a joy. Although she stands on a higher ground, and although she has a love relationship with the Lord and is different from others who serve Him out of a sense of duty, nevertheless, she does not give less than what the Lord’s duty requires.</p><p>Not only does Solomon receive something; those who keep watch over the fruits also receive something. She renders rightful glory and praise to all those helping her in the work. She does not take over their rightful portion. May God’s children not usurp the glory of their co-workers.</p><p>When the Lord rewards His workers, she will be included among those keeping the fruits; she will receive the two hundred pieces of silver. According to righteousness, she should only receive the fruits and not the silver (S.S. 8:11). However, all those who serve the Lord in love will find that when they do not take the Lord’s work as a commercial enterprise, the Lord will not reward them on a commercial basis. In addition to receiving her fruits, the Lord bestows glory on her. The judgment seat should be something along the line of Matthew. However, the emphasis here is not on responsibility but on love. The question of work and reward should not have been brought up. However, the Holy Spirit mentions it from the standpoint of love, not from the standpoint of responsibility. It is mentioned because it matches the principle of the whole book.</p>
