<p>In grouping the saints together, we do not need to legally follow a certain way. We can group the saints together according to the Spirit and according to the situation. In certain instances it may be more convenient to group the saints by geography. However, in some situations that way may not yield the best result. It may be better to group people according to the situation, taking into account factors such as geography, age, status, character, and spiritual condition. In some situations grouping the young ones together with the old ones may not be a help to the young ones, but in other instances grouping the young ones with certain elderly saints will make the young ones more living. It would not be good to group seven people of weak character together, nor would it be good to group too many people of strong character together. In grouping the saints, the elders need to study the situation of all the saints.</p>
<p>In forming the groups, all preferences should be annulled. According to our past experience, some of the saints have a strong preference to be together. However, we need to realize that a particular group may stay together for only six months. After six months the groups should increase to the point that they need to divide into two groups. Thus, we should forget our personal preferences. In some cases if a husband and wife are put in different groups, they will be made alive and they will be more able to help others. We need to put all these matters into our consideration, and we need to learn. In a certain sense, in the church life the husbands and wives are not couples but are individual members of the Body. We need to be coordinated not according to the natural relationship but according to the membership in the Body. At home the husbands and wives are couples, but in the church they are individual members, irrespective of their marital status. In our homes we enjoy our married life, but when we come to the church, we are all members of the Body. In the church we enjoy the church life. This should be the principle. Otherwise, the groups will not be prevailing.</p>
<p>It is better if the Caucasians are grouped with other Caucasians. Those of the other races can also be grouped together according to race and language. In addition, we can have a general English-speaking group, including those from different races who can speak English well. As much as possible it may be better to keep the Caucasians separate and particular to serve the purpose of gaining Caucasians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Relationship of the Vital Groups<br />
with the Present Church Life</h2>
<p>We must be clear that the vital group meetings should not interfere with the present church life. We still respect and honor the present church life. If possible those in the vital groups should attend the church meetings, mainly the Lord&rsquo;s table and the prophesying meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, and the prayer meeting. However, it may not be practical for those in the vital groups to attend the existing group meetings, because they will be meeting at least once a week in the vital groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRAINING FOR THE VITAL GROUPS</h2>
<p>Those who attend the training meetings for the vital groups must be punctual. Furthermore, when they come to the meeting, they must pray audibly. They should not come in to the meeting and sit and be silent. We will have much prayer; this is our real need. Nothing in our Christian life can touch our life, open our eyes, and usher us into the reality of what Christ is more than prayer. We need to pray. Among us we are not short of the Word of God. However, the thing that troubles me continually is our shortage of prayer. In the training meetings every member must function to pray. The third requirement on the trainees is that each one must speak in the training meetings.</p>
<p>After four months of training concerning the group meetings, every group will be ready to act. Every group will be a small army. The first thing we need to do is to go out and gain new ones. Without new ones, we have no one to work on. This time we will not get the new ones in a quick way, and we will not baptize them in a quick way. As I mentioned in a previous message, every Lord&rsquo;s Day the groups may come together to have a separate Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting at a time different from that of the regular church meeting. During those meetings we can baptize the new ones in the church&rsquo;s baptistry. This will make the baptism of the new ones somewhat stately and full of spiritual weight. After the baptism, we can have the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>Our success in having a definite beginning in the practice of the vital groups depends on our faithfulness. We need to be faithful to coordinate with the Lord in order to match the Lord. Then the Lord will have a way. If in all the churches a good number of the saints will be trained to take this way and to move in a trained way, surely we will gain the adequate increase.</p>
<p>Concluding prayer: Lord, thank You that we can match You in Your move. Lord, do grant us the rich blessing, and send the rain that we need. We are going to till the ground and sow the seed. Surely, we need Your rain, the latter rain and the former rain, at the proper time. Amen.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Fellowship Concerning the Urgent Need of the Vital Groups &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
