   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE IN SOUL BY THE SPIRIT OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first two chapters of Philippians are related to the Spirit of Jesus, and the last two are related to the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapters one and two are related not to resurrection, but to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But chapters three and four are related to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, Philippians 3:10 says, "To know him and the power of his resurrection" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>. Furthermore, Philippians 4:13 says, "I can do all things in him who empowers me" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>. This is the Spirit of Christ, who is related to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the first chapter of Philippians we have the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To preach the gospel we need the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit of Jesus is clearly portrayed in the first two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit of Jesus does not strive, and it has no rivalry or enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Jesus, the Nazarene, was on earth, He did not have any envy, strife, or rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These three negative things are mentioned in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this chapter there are also some positive things, such as the fellowship and the matter of being in one spirit and one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can we have one spirit and one soul?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not possible by our spirit, for our spirit is a spirit of envy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we see others taking the lead, we are envious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we begin to strive in the spirit of rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although our spirit is like this, the Spirit of Jesus is not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Consider the life of Jesus as presented in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His life was a life without envy, strife, or rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be one in spirit and in soul is possible only in the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be one soul mainly means to be one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The reason Christians cannot be one soul is that each desires to be first and that no one is willing to be last.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But it is possible for us to be one soul by the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we say, "I want to be in the Spirit of Jesus," we shall immediately have the experience of Christ and be one spirit and one soul with others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we shall strive together for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word "together" in Philippians 1:27 means that we are coordinated and that we are not individualistic, but corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are all in the Spirit of Jesus and are in one soul, we shall strive together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the first chapter of Philippians is rather long, it may be outlined quite simply.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This chapter is concerned with the fellowship in the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus without envy, strife, or rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is in this way that we experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not simply a matter of clearing the past, consecrating ourselves, or caring for the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That is not the way from the Body to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to reach the Head, we need the fellowship in the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus without envy, strife, or rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our gospel-preaching life there should be no envy, strife, or rivalry, not even with the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, we should simply preach the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But as long as there is the slightest bit of rivalry, we cannot be in the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, if we are not in the Spirit of Jesus, we are not in the fellowship of the gospel, and we are through with the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To experience Christ we need the fellowship in the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus without envy, strife, or rivalry.</S>
