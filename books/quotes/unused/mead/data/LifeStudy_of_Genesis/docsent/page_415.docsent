   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7 The Competition, Envy, and Wrestling</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>between Jacob's Wives in Bearing Children</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jacob's two wives competed in bearing children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This competition put Jacob into the oven, making him like an ant in a hot oven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Four women, Laban's two daughters and their two maids, made life difficult for Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he had had no preference, he would only have had one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, due to his having a preference, he was given four wives.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have seen, Rachel, the wife of his choice, was not his real wife; his real wife was Leah, the one he did not like.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of the rivalry between Rachel and Leah, their two maids, Bilhah and Zilpah, were given to Jacob as wives 30:4, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These four women were a team playing against Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we compare Jacob with Isaac, we see that Isaac was very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had no preference, but accepted whomever and whatever came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the best wife, Rebekah, was given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Isaac's case, there were no complications.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But there were many complications in Jacob's case because he had a preference.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, Jacob's having his own preference was also under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not despise yourself, saying, "I just hate myself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why wasn't I born simple?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, you should praise God for your not being simple, saying, "O Lord, thank You for not creating me as a simple person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Praise You, Lord, that I am so complicated."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you ever thanked and praised God in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not say, "Oh I'm sorry for the mistakes I made in the past."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even your mistakes are under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If many of us had never made any mistakes, we would probably not be in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Praise the Lord that our mistakes have brought us into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Praise God for His sovereignty!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I laugh whenever I read of Laban's beguiling Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In all of human history, there probably has not been another time when a father-in-law has played such a trick on his son-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only in the Bible do we read of such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the night, Jacob was dreaming of having his choice, but when the day dawned, he saw that he had been given the one he did not like.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we see God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then, in addition to Leah and Rachel, two other wives were given to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jacob surely did not intend to have four wives.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As all the married brothers can testify, one wife is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But Jacob no longer had a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Four wives were given to him, and there was nothing he could do about it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was surrounded by them and was no longer free to do what he wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day, Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, found some mandrakes in the field and gave them to his mother Leah 30:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to Song of Songs 7:13, mandrakes are a type of love fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Rachel wanted the mandrakes, Leah said, "Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>30:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To this Rachel said that Leah might have Jacob that night in exchange for Reuben's mandrakes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Jacob came from the field that evening, Leah met him and said, "Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes" 30:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jacob had lost his freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was like a volleyball being passed from one person to another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jacob was in such a predicament because his wives were competing with each other in childbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we read Jacob's story, we must worship God for His being so sovereign, fair, and purposeful.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jacob loved Rachel, not Leah.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the hated Leah bore him four sons 29:31-35 , and the loved Rachel was barren 30:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Genesis 29:31 says, "When the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although Leah was hated, she found favor in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Leah gave birth to her firstborn, Reuben, whose name means "See a son," she said, "Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction" 29:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Leah's second son was named Simeon, whose name means "Hearing."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After giving birth to Simeon, she said, "Because the Lord hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also" 29:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Leah's third son was named Levi, whose name means "Joined."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Levi was born, Leah exclaimed, "Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons" 29:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In 29:35 we are told that Leah "conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, "Now will I praise the Lord: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The name Judah means "Praise."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After bearing these four sons, Leah could do nothing except praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When Rachel saw that she had borne Jacob no children, she envied her sister and said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I die" 30:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When Jacob heard this, he was angry and said, "Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>30:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do you think that Jacob had much enjoyment in this situation?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No, he was constantly troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rachel then gave Jacob Bilhah her handmaid as his wife 30:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God was sovereign in this matter also.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Bilhah gave birth to two sons: Dan, whose name means "Judging," and Naphtali, whose name means "My wrestling" 30:5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At the birth of Dan, Rachel declared, "God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son" 30:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whether God had vindicated Rachel or not is known only to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But according to Rachel's understanding, God had vindicated her.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When Bilhah gave birth to Naphtali, Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed" 30:8, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In Hebrew, the word mighty in this verse great in KJV is the word for God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, this phrase may be rendered as "wrestlings of God."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This does not mean that Rachel fought with Leah; it means that she went to God many times, saying, "O God, You must judge and vindicate.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You have given four sons to my sister Leah, but You have not given any to me."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>She wrestled in this manner with the "wrestlings of God."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In other words, she had wrestled in the presence of God, and, after the birth of Naphtali, she thought that she had prevailed and won the case.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, Dan and Naphtali were not brought forth by her, but by her maid.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When Leah saw that Rachel's maid had given birth to two sons, she seemed to say, "If Rachel can give her maid to Jacob, then why can't I do the same?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Let me do it, too!"</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Leah then gave her maid Zilpah to Jacob as a wife and she bore him two sons Gad and Asher 30:9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Gad means "Fortunate," and Asher means "Happy."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When Gad was born, Leah said, "Fortunate!"</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>30:11, Heb , and when Asher was born, she said, "Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed" 30:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In a good sense, Leah was fortunate because she had borne Jacob four sons herself and two more through her maid.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>She thought that she was happy and that all women would bless her.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In Hebrew, the words happy and blessed are of the same root.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Thus, a happy person is a blessed person and a blessed person is a happy person.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This was Leah's concept.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God gave Leah two more sons: Issachar and Zebulun 30:17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The name Issachar means "Hire."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When he was born, Leah said, "God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband" 30:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Deep within, Leah must have thought that Issachar was born because she had hired Jacob by giving Reuben's mandrakes to Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is a further indication of the competition between these women.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When Zebulun was born, Leah said, "God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons" 30:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Leah seemed to be saying, "I don't want Jacob to leave me.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I want him to stay with me."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In this record we clearly see the competition between Jacob's wives.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At this point, Rachel still had not borne any children of her own.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Let us consider the chronology.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Jacob went to Laban's home approximately in the year 1760 B.C. and he was married in approximately 1753 B.C. Eight years later, Joseph was born.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Under God's sovereign hand, Rachel was barren, not bearing any children until eight years had passed.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Then God gave her a son whom she called Joseph, saying, "The Lord shall add to me another son" 30:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The meaning of the name Joseph "Adding" indicates that Rachel wanted God to add another son to her.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Her desire was fulfilled six years later with the birth of Benjamin 35:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Delivering Benjamin was a very difficult ordeal for her, costing Rachel her life.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Giving birth to Benjamin as she was dying, Rachel "called his name Benoni: but his father called his name Benjamin" 35:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Benoni means "Son of my sorrow."</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>How meaningful it is that Jacob changed the child's name to Benjamin, which means "The son of the right hand."</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In the Bible, Benjamin is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Firstly, Christ was Benoni, the Son of sorrow Isa 53:3 , but eventually He became Benjamin, the Son at the right hand of God Matt 26:64 .</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Rachel gave birth to two sons, but in delivering the second she lost her life.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This means that Jacob gained his last son at the cost of his beloved wife.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>These experiences were like knives which cut Jacob to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Jacob loved Rachel, but she was barren.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>After giving birth to Joseph, she expected to have a second son.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This desire was fulfilled at the cost of her life.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Jacob loved Joseph and Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Among all his twelve sons, they were his two favorites.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Although Jacob gained these two sons, God never allowed him to have Rachel, his dear wife, and these two favorite sons at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>In the following chapters we shall see how much Jacob suffered over Joseph and Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>In all this, Jacob was constantly under the working of God's sovereign, transforming hand.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>How meaningful it is to read these chapters and how helpful it is to see the life they contain.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Although these chapters seem quite long, they contain much nourishment for us.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The more we consider Jacob's record, the more we realize that our record is exactly the same as his.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>In God's eyes, Jacob's story is the story of us all.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We are today's Jacobs under God's hand, for God is now accomplishing His transforming work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Thank Him for His hand and thank Him for His transforming work.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Regardless of our situation, environment, and circumstances, we are always under His transforming hand.</S>
