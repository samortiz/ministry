<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Cakes</H2><P>Besides the meat of the cattle, the offerer also enjoys three kinds of cakes as his portion (7:12-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Unleavened Cakes&#151;Thin Cakes with Holes&#151;<br>Mingled with Oil</H2><P>First, there are unleavened cakes mingled with oil. Darby points out in a note on Leviticus 2:4 that these cakes are very thin with holes. Their being thin and perforated makes them easier to eat and digest. This is a type of Christ as the One who is easy to eat and digest. He is mingled with the Spirit, and He is unleavened, without any sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) Unleavened, Hollow Wafers Anointed with Oil</H2><P>The second kind of cake is the unleavened, hollow wafers anointed with oil. These wafers are also easy to eat, digest, and enjoy because they are empty, hollow, within. The unleavened cakes are mingled with oil, whereas the unleavened, hollow wafers are anointed with oil.</P><P>Christ was always hollow within; to be hollow means to be poor in spirit. Furthermore, He was pierced on the cross, that is, He was perforated. Many Christians today are like a cake twelve inches thick, without one hole. No one can eat of them. But Christ was not that thick. Christ made Himself so humble. He was hollow, poor in spirit, and perforated, pierced, for our enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Cakes of Fine Flour Saturated and Mingled with Oil</H2><P>The third kind of cake is of fine flour saturated and mingled with oil. To be mingled is one thing, to be saturated is another thing, and to be anointed is still another thing. For the cake to be mingled with oil is something within. For the cake to be saturated with oil is for it to be soaked with oil. For the cake to be anointed with oil is for the oil to be poured upon it.</P><P>These cakes were to be offered with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, which is something we add to what God requires. God is satisfied with the required ox, the required sheep, the required lamb, or the required goat. But when we are so grateful for what we have enjoyed of Christ, we have something to give to God for our thanksgiving. This is an experience of Christ in addition to what God requires and is initiated by us. Because we are so grateful to God for Christ, we bring something additional of Christ to God.</P><P>Of course, what Christ has done for us in His redemption is altogether included in the cattle. We cannot add anything to this. But still the cattle does not include Christ's behavior, Christ's human life. We need to read the four Gospels to realize Christ's human living on this earth. He is typified by the cakes of the peace offering, which were thin and hollow. When we are grateful to God, we bring something of Christ in the aspect of His human living as our gratitude to God.</P>
