 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM AS AN EXERCISE<br />
AND A REWARD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOAL, THE MATERIAL, AND THE WAY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to build the church with Christ through the kingdom. The church is God&rsquo;s goal, God&rsquo;s desire and destination. His intention is to build the church. As we all know, in order to build anything we need certain material. The material for the building of the church is Christ. Along with the material, we also need the method of building. In Matthew 16 we see the goal, the material, and the method. The goal is the church, the material is Christ, and the method is the kingdom.</p>
<p>After the Lord Jesus had asked His disciples to tell Him who they thought He was, Peter received the revelation that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God. Because it is not adequate simply to have the revelation of Christ, the Lord Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (v. 18). When verse 18 is put with verse 16, we have the complete revelation: Christ and the church, the great mystery of God (Eph. 5:32). Christ is for the church. Peter&rsquo;s revelation and the acknowledgment of that revelation are the rock upon which the Lord will build His church. Therefore, the church is the goal, and the Christ revealed and acknowledged by the disciples is the material with which the church is built.</p>
<p>Although in verses 16 and 18 we have the goal and the material, we do not have the way. This is revealed in verse 19, where the Lord said, &ldquo;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Exercising the keys of the kingdom is the way to build the church. In other words, the way to build the church is through the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST, THE CHURCH, AND THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>Today the word church is used so lightly that it has become virtually meaningless. Many Christians speak of going to church or of belonging to a certain church. But because of the way they use this term, it has no weight or significance. In the New Testament, however, the word church is a weighty term. Before Matthew 16, this word is not found in the Bible. In the Gospels the word church is used only twice, in Matthew 16 and in Matthew 18. The church is God&rsquo;s goal in the universe. Thus, the church is something very significant, even though Christians have made it appear to be nothing.</p>
<p>If you consider the history of Christianity, you will realize that the enemy has frustrated the believers from Christ and the kingdom. Not many Christians know Christ as He should be known. As we have seen, for the building of the church we need Christ, because Christ is the material for the building. The church can only be built with Christ.</p>
<p>Christians have also been frustrated from knowing the kingdom. Few Christian teachers today speak about the kingdom. If you examine today&rsquo;s Christian publications, you will find very little mention of the kingdom. Fifty years ago, many articles spoke of the kingdom, and those involved in evangelical work even spoke of spreading the kingdom. But today this term is used rarely because the kingdom has become foreign to our understanding. This is due to the subtlety of the enemy. If we are frustrated from knowing Christ and if we neglect the kingdom, we are through with the church because the church is built with Christ and through the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXERCISE OF THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>If you carefully read the New Testament regarding the kingdom, you will see that today the kingdom is an exercise to us. Therefore, we speak of the exercise of the kingdom. The New Testament also reveals clearly that in the future the kingdom will be a reward to us. Thus, the kingdom is an exercise today and a reward in the coming age. The positive reward of the kingdom is to enter into the joy of the Lord. Matthew 25:21 and 23 both say, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord.&rdquo; In the coming age those who receive this positive reward of the kingdom will be co-kings with Christ. We shall no longer be under an exercise; rather, we shall be reigning with Christ. Today, however, is not the time for us to reign, to be the co-kings of Christ. This is for the coming age. For us today, the kingdom is an exercise. Thus, we are not reigning; we are being exercised. This is the reason we need to lose our soul. To reign is not to lose the soul, but to gain the soul. To be poor in spirit and to suffer for the sake of righteousness is not to reign; it is to be exercised.</p>
