<h2 class="head2">B. Charging Solomon His Son<br />
to Serve God and<br />
to Build the Temple of God</h2>
<p>In verses 9 through 21 David charged Solomon his son to serve God and to build the temple of God. He charged Solomon to serve God with his &ldquo;whole heart and with a willing soul, for Jehovah searches all the hearts and understands every imagination of the thoughts&rdquo; (v. 9). Then David charged Solomon to build the temple of God according to the pattern that he had by the Spirit, having God&rsquo;s presence, with the priests, the Levites, the willing men with wisdom for any service, the leaders, and all the people wholly at his command (vv. 10-21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. His Preparation of the Materials<br />
and His Gifts for the Building of the Temple<br />
of God Stirring Up the Leaders of Israel<br />
to Offer Willingly to God</h2>
<p>David&rsquo;s preparation of the materials and his gifts for the building of the temple of God stirred up the leaders of Israel to offer willingly their gifts to God for the building of His temple, so that both the people of Israel and David the king rejoiced with great joy (29:1-9). In this matter David and the leaders of Israel were one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. His Blessing to Jehovah<br />
in the Sight of All the Assembly</h2>
<p>Verses 10 through 19 are David&rsquo;s blessing to Jehovah in the sight of all the assembly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Praising God</h2>
<p>First, David praised God for His greatness, power, splendor, victory, and majesty (vv. 10-12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Thanking God</h2>
<p>Next, David thanked God that it was of Him that he and the people could willingly offer back to God all things which they had received from Him (vv. 13-17). They had received so much from God, and what they had received they offered back to God for the building of the house of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Asking God</h2>
<p>David continued by asking God to keep and establish the heart of His people Israel in this sound condition and give Solomon his son a wholeness of heart to keep God&rsquo;s commandments, testimonies, and statutes and to do all and build the palace (the temple) of God (vv. 18-19).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Response of All the Assembly</h2>
<p>Verses 20 through 25 describe the response of all the assembly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Blessing Jehovah</h2>
<p>The people blessed Jehovah, offered sacrifices to Him, and worshipped Him (vv. 20-21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Eating and Drinking before Jehovah and Making Solomon the Son of David<br />
King a Second Time</h2>
<p>The people ate and drank before Jehovah and made Solomon the son of David king a second time. All Israel obeyed him, with all the leaders and mighty men and all the sons of King David submitting themselves to Solomon the king. Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel and bestowed upon him a royal majesty that had never been on any king before him over Israel (vv. 22-25).</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. David Dying at a Good Old Age</h2>
<p>David died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor (v. 28).</p>
<p>Although we need to know these historical matters, I do not have much burden concerning them, for they are not the center, the reality, the goal, of the Bible. The center, the reality, and the goal of the Bible is God&rsquo;s economy. God&rsquo;s economy is that God would become a man to make man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead for the producing of the New Jerusalem as the increase and expression of the Triune God for eternity. The New Jerusalem is built by God&rsquo;s constituting Himself into man to make man the same as God in life, in nature, and in constitution so that God and man may become a corporate entity.</p>
