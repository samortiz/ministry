<h1 class="title">FOUR MAJOR ITEMS OF SERVICE&mdash;<br />
LIFE, THE TRUTH, THE CHURCH,<br />
AND THE GOSPEL</h1>
<p>In our service we should pay attention to four major items&mdash;life, the truth, the church, and the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE</h2>
<p>We need to pay attention to life, the divine life. This is the base of all things. Not only spiritual matters are based on life; worldly matters are also based on life. The things that we do depend on the life that we have. In the church life we cannot have religious services or organized activities. Our service can come only from life. The service of the church and the testimony of the church are based on life. Hence, we cannot neglect life, nor should we be detached from life. We should take Christ as the base and the source of our service, and our service should be the issue of life. It is by the divine life that we live before God, and it is in this life that we have our being, our living, and our service.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have paid sufficient attention to the knowledge and experience of life. We have given messages concerning life, and we have learned practical lessons on life. The saints have been led to pursue the four stages of life and have properly learned the lessons in each stage. We have terminated the things of the past and offered ourselves to the Lord. We are learning to live before Him, walk according to the Spirit, and do His will in all things. We have given messages concerning dealing with sins, the world, our conscience, the flesh, the self, and our spirit. We are learning to abide in the Lord, to fellowship with Him, to live within the veil, and to have a mingled living with the Lord. On a deeper level we are learning that the church is the Body of Christ. We are not perfecting the Body life with the natural life. In the resurrection life of Christ we are fellow members with the saints, we are coordinated into one Body, and we have the service of the Body. We are learning to keep our position as members in the Body, and we are learning spiritual warfare and spiritual dealings. The saints have learned some lessons in all these matters. These lessons determine the basis of our service and give our service weight. Our service is based on learning these lessons.</p>
<p>We have also spoken concerning the cross. In order to serve in coordination, we must receive the breaking of the cross. If we do not apply the cross to deal with our flesh, the self, and the natural life, it will not be easy for us to coordinate with other saints and serve in harmony and in oneness. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, in the past we were blessed with harmony because the saints were led to know that the cross has terminated our flesh, our self, and our natural life. As a result, we coordinated and served together under the termination of the cross. We did not quarrel or express opinions. Even the slightest differing views were trampled beneath our feet. We worship the Lord because He has indeed been the Head among us. He has obtained the position He deserves, He has obtained our exaltation, and He has obtained the church&rsquo;s worship. Although we have many weaknesses, our little strength has not been consumed with negative problems. The above points are related to life.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not neglect the base of life. Every responsible brother must learn serious lessons concerning life. He should at least have the experience of the first two stages of being in Christ and of abiding in Christ (see <em>The Experience of Life</em>). We need to fellowship with the Lord, have dealings, and consecrate ourselves. We also need to deal with sins, the world, our conscience, and obey the teaching of the anointing. These experiences are the base of our service. We must not neglect these experiences. Furthermore, we should bring this pursuit of life to our various localities so that the saints may also be led to pursue the growth in life. The saints should not only love the Lord zealously but also pursue to know the Lord as life and learn to live in this life. Such a pursuit, leading, and atmosphere should be in every home meeting. This is the principle. The responsible saints should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning the details of carrying out this principle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We must pay attention to the truth. The truth is our constitution. When we speak of the truth, we are referring to what is revealed in the Bible. Our living, walk, service, and administration of the church should not be according to our own view, the world, or deformed Christianity. We must do everything according to the Bible. The indwelling Spirit needs the Bible in our hands, and the Bible needs the Spirit within us. The Spirit within is our life, and the Bible is our truth. The atmosphere of our service should give people the impression that everything we do is according to the truth in the Bible. Every matter, no matter how great or small, should be done according to the truth. We would not propose, initiate, create, or decide any matter according to our will. Rather, everything we do should be based on the Bible.</p>
<p>The responsible saints should have the habit and atmosphere of reading the Bible, and they should bring the saints into the habit and atmosphere of reading the Bible. We want to receive the nourishment of life, the bread of life, from the Bible. We also want to see light in the truth of the Bible so that we may know the Lord&rsquo;s way in our living, walk, work, and service. Everything that we do should have the truth as its standard. We are not an organization with regulations, nor do we follow a creed. We have only the Bible. As much as possible, we should endeavor to serve according to the truth.</p>
<p>We will be enlivened when we live in the divine life and walk according to the truth. Furthermore, our service will be secure. The divine life enlivens us, and the truth protects us. When we have both life and the truth, we will not easily encounter problems in our service. Otherwise, we will be in peril. If we emphasize the truth and neglect the divine life, we will become dead. If we emphasize the divine life and neglect the truth, we will lose our protection and be vulnerable to improper activities and unsound behavior. A locomotive needs the supply of fire, water, and air in order to move. It also needs railroad tracks to secure its movement. Likewise, our service must be built on the two bases of life and the truth in order for our service to be full of life and secure.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
