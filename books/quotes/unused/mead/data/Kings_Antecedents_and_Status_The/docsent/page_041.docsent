   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fleeing to Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ was found in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This discovery of Christ created trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God used this trouble to bring the young child out of Bethlehem to Egypt Matt 2:13-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hosea 11:1 prophesied that Jesus would be called out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without the trouble that occurred after Jesus was found in Bethlehem, there would have been no occasion for Him to flee to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The wise men made a great mistake, but their mistake offered God the opportunity to fulfill His prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But do not make mistakes purposely.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Try your best to do things right.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, no matter how hard you try to be right, eventually you will make as big a mistake as the wise men did.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Never say, "Let us do evil, that good may come."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you do evil, good will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if you try to be right but still make a mistake, that mistake will offer God a chance to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because Joseph fled with Mary and Jesus into Egypt, the young child Jesus escaped the first martyrdom, the martyrdom caused by the mistake of the wise men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan is always busy, waiting for an opportunity to cause martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, God is sovereign over all, even over Satan, to preserve His dear ones from the enemy's wiles.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By God's sovereignty the young Jesus was preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Raised in Nazareth</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At this point I need to present a little history.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although you know the story, you may still need more light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mary conceived a child in Nazareth Luke 1:26-27, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the prophecy in Micah 5:2, however, Christ had to be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Under God's sovereign arrangement, Caesar Augustus ordered the first census of the Roman Empire Luke 2:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This forced all the people to return to their native places.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Mary and Joseph were forced to return to Bethlehem, their hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Immediately after they arrived in Bethlehem, the child Jesus was born.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The mistake of the magi aroused the hatred and jealousy of King Herod, who was angered that a kingly child had been born.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then Joseph received guidance in a dream to take the child to Egypt Matt 2:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This enabled God to fulfill the prophecy of Hosea 11:1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Herod had died, Joseph received word in another dream to return to the Holy Land Matt 2:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Joseph had returned and had learned that Archelaus, the son of Herod, was in power, he was afraid to remain in the territory around Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, he went to Nazareth, where Jesus was raised vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason Jesus was called Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What does all this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It means that when Jesus was born into the human race, He appeared in a way that was somewhat hidden, in a way that was not open or evident.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes I have even used the word "sneaky" to describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone called Him Jesus of Nazareth, for He was a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the Bible said that Christ would be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The hidden way of Christ's birth bothered all the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Philip met Jesus, he realized that Jesus was the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then Philip went to Nathanael and told him that he had met the Messiah and that He was the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Immediately Nathanael said, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 1:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Did Philip give Nathanael the wrong information?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is difficult to say.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Philip only knew that Jesus was the son of Joseph and that He was a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although Jesus was from Nazareth and was a Nazarene, He had not been born in Nazareth, but in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nathanael was troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, Philip did not argue with him; he simply said, "Come and see" John 1:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On another occasion, Nicodemus, who had come to know Jesus, tried to argue with the Pharisees concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Pharisees asked him, "Are you also from Galilee?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John 7:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Galilee was a Gentile region, and the Bible says "Galilee of the nations" Matt 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Pharisees seemed to say to Nicodemus, "Are you from Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We know that Jesus came out of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But out of Galilee there comes no prophet."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Apparently, Jesus was from Galilee, from Nazareth; actually, He was born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That was His somewhat hidden and secret way of appearing to people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I refer you to the type of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The tabernacle was covered with rough, tough badgers' skin; outside, it did not appear to be very attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Inside, however, was fine linen, gold, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The spiritual principle of the church is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do not look at the church from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You need to come inside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am sure that if the Apostle Paul would come to visit you, you would be surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You would ask, "Are you Brother Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I thought that the Apostle Paul would be like a shining angel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But what are you?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You are just a small man without a comely appearance."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should never make a display of ourselves; neither should we ever know others according to the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must know them according to the inward spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In appearance, Jesus was a Nazarene, but within Him there was gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Within Him there was the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Second Corinthians 5:16 says that we should not know Christ or any man after the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, we must discern the inward reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must keep this principle today.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In order to find Christ, we must have the shining star.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must not go according to the outward appearance, but according to what is within.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you would know the church or the saints, do not be bothered by the outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do not give any value to outward things, such as huge cathedrals, large church buildings, or pipe organs.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Forget all that.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Jesus had nothing outstanding outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He was a little Nazarene, One who grew up in a province that was called "Galilee of the nations" and who was raised in a city despised by people "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But if you "come and see" and get into Him, you will appreciate Him and be caught by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Likewise, you need to come into the church and stay with the church for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you do, you will find something precious.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The same is true with the seeking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The more they seek the Lord, the more they hide their experiences of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You need to go to them and stay with them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Then you will get into them and find the riches that are within them.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You will see the frankincense, the myrrh, and many other precious treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Then you will be attracted and caught.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is the way to find Christ and to appreciate all He is and all His precious items, the gold, the frankincense, and the myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Matthew 2:23 says, "He shall be called a Nazarene."</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Some have guessed this word Nazarene refers to "Nazarite" in Numbers 6:2.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Others have guessed that it refers to the Hebrew word for branch, netzer, in Isaiah 11:1.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But I do not think that we have to guess that much.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We know that in appearance Jesus was a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This was spoken by the prophets.</S>
