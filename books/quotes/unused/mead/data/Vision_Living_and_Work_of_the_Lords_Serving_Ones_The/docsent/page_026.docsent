   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEADING NEW ONES TO KNOW THE CRUCIAL POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the Lord would give me another thirty years to speak two messages a day on the church, I would not exhaust this topic, because the entire Bible is on Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the source, and the church is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ and the church are the great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, in order to lead new believers, we must learn the crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should lead them from the experience of life to knowing the church, enabling them to see that the church is a product of Christ; the church is the Eve of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God caused Adam to fall asleep and took one of his ribs to build a woman, Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the same principle, the Lord Jesus is our Adam 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He died on the cross, His side was opened, and water flowed out for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Epistles the Holy Spirit is building the church to be the Body of Christ 12:27; Eph 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the universal aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church s being universal is mysterious and difficult to comprehend, yet it is easy to accept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, pastors in all the denominations accept that the church is universally one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, it would be difficult for them to accept that the church is locally one, even though it is easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, today Taipei is like a church market with many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only do pastors find it difficult to accept that there is only one church in one city, but ordinary Christians also do not accept this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They think that those who promote the ground of the church are self-righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are not clear about the truth, we might waver when people accuse us of being self-righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many saints have been confused by this kind of wind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When such a wind blows, we should go to Caesarea Philippi so that our vision may be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The revival of the church in Chefoo in 1943 occurred when the Japanese invaded northern China.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Japanese army had an internal security agency that was assigned to trouble the Chinese people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result of the revival, we had a large number of saints and a large amount of material offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This aroused the attention of the agency.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After investigating us for about three months, the special agents arrested me and put me in jail for thirty days of interrogation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The official in charge of the interrogation tested me on many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He saw that I was indeed a God fan, who wanted nothing but God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During that time I experienced the presence of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many miracles and strange things happened.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once they asked me why the other Christian groups in Chefoo criticized me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord gave me wisdom to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I responded that the Chinese say that people of the same trade are enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Chefoo there were eight other groups, and on the Lord s Day the number in our meeting was equal to the total number in the other eight groups.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, the other groups were jealous and would not say anything good about me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we go to a place to preach the gospel, we are willing to dwell in harmony with all the other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The problem is not with us; they are in division.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I grew up in Chefoo and came from a Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although my family was poor, I was able to study in an institution of higher education run by Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In those days Chefoo was not a large city; it did not have more than two hundred thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everyone knew who were the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After I was saved, I pursued the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the pastors in the denominations noticed me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then the Lord raised up a church there, and I was the main speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our number increased very quickly from eleven to more than fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Within a year there were more than a hundred in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This surprised the pastors from the denominations, such that they held a meeting and discussed how I had not attended a seminary but could speak better than a seminary graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, they said that we liked to steal their good sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the end of 1935 the work arranged for me to move to Tientsin to labor in the Beijing and Tientsin area; I was there for more than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During this period I visited Chefoo, and the elders from the denominations jointly invited me for a meal with the intention of dealing with me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During this meal the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ upheld and equipped me to answer their questions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the first course, one of the elders said that it is right for me to preach the gospel and teach the truth, but it is not right for me to draw people away from other groups to mine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, they decided to ask me to not do that anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The rest of the elders, who were present, all agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I responded that they were all my seniors, and I was grateful to have the opportunity to make this matter clear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They all expressed their consent.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I said that in 1 Corinthians 1, Paul rebuked the believers in Corinth because they said, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul asked them whether Christ is divided vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can see that in the Bible division is not acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, today there is a great number of denominations and sects, such as the Presbyterian Church, the Chinese Independent Church, the Baptist Church, and those established by the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I asked whether Paul or the Bible would approve of this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then I said, Such divisions were absolutely not allowed by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By the Lord s grace, I received mercy to love Him and to study the truth; hence, I am able to speak the truth and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, where should I take the people who are saved after I preach the gospel: where should they meet?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Most certainly I cannot be in a division; so I cannot go to the Baptist Church or the Presbyterian Church or the Chinese Independent Church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Where should I take the new believers who are saved through my preaching of the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I cannot send them to a place where I myself would not go.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Each denomination insists on separating itself; this compels me to meet with those who are saved through my preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You know that my group does not have a name.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are not Presbyterian nor Baptist nor Independent nor the China Inland Mission.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are merely a group of believers who love the Lord and meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You are my seniors, and you understand that we meet in this way because you have forced us to.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you, as representatives of the various denominations in Chefoo, can promise me that you will take down your signs, I also promise you that I will tell the believers who meet with me that we will close the door of our meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I will take the lead to close the door if you will take down your denominational names.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After that they said that they could not do this, and I responded, If you are not able to do this, you must bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I continued, Sirs, you insist on keeping the name of your respective denomination or group, and you are condemning me for drawing your people away.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Are these people not the Lord s sheep?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Sheep always look for grass; wherever there is grass, they will go.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Believers come to me because there is grass.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Please do not blame me.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you provide a good pasture, the sheep will surely be drawn to you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is not a matter of who is drawing the sheep but a matter of where the grass is.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After this the elders had nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This testimony is to help us see the ground of the church and to teach us how to deal with this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is not easy for people to accept the church being one on the local ground.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Hence, we should be like boxers when we lead new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Instead of speaking randomly, we should convince them with clear points of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This requires us to learn.</S>
