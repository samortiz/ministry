<h2 class="head1">CAREFULLY SELECTING THE READING MATERIAL</h2>
<p>Such a practice involves an effort on the part of the co-workers and the elders. We must carefully select the proper material for the home meetings. We need to spend an adequate amount of time to pray thoroughly, to observe the condition of the brothers and sisters, and to understand the need of all the homes and the groups. We need to know their conditions, and then we should search out the suitable material from our publications. A mother, in preparing a meal for the family, should consider the condition of all the members of the family. Sometimes one member of the family is sick, and she needs to prepare special food for that one. Sometimes the season changes, and she needs to shop for the proper kind of food. All this takes research as well as common knowledge.</p>
<p>We cannot be nonchalant in the kind of material we use for the home meetings. It is not that as soon as we have a new book, we automatically pass it on to the homes and the groups for their study. This can be compared to a mother going to the market and buying a cartload of watermelons simply because the melons are fresh and inexpensive. If she does that, some who have ulcers will end up in a worse predicament. We may say, &ldquo;This is too difficult. Who can do this?&rdquo; Even if this is difficult, we still must do it. If the co-workers and the elders do not do it, it will be harder for the other brothers and sisters to do it. If we make the effort to learn, sooner or later we will pick up the way. The most important thing is to take this matter seriously. We must meet the need of men in a solid way.</p>
<p>Recently, when some co-workers came to the United States to attend the conferences and trainings, I rebuked them, saying, &ldquo;Look! Everything in Taiwan has advanced. We are the only ones who have not advanced. We are still holding the same standard and doing the same thing as thirty years ago.&rdquo; Now all the co-workers have improved, but we still have not reached the proper standard. We must raise the standard still higher. Although I am a little older than you are and have more experience in the work, I am still learning. I hope that we will all learn. While we work, we should learn at the same time.</p>
<p>Matthew 24:45 says that the faithful and prudent slave distributes food to God&rsquo;s children at the proper time. The meaning of distributing food to God&rsquo;s children at the proper time is profound. It does not mean merely to distribute food according to the seasons but to distribute different kinds of food according to the varying needs. This is something that requires time and research. Suppose we meet a new one, and without any regard for his condition we begin to share with him about the seventy weeks in Daniel. It is true that we are speaking God&rsquo;s word, but that kind of &ldquo;distributing of food&rdquo; does not nourish him. Instead, it kills him. God&rsquo;s word is life, but if we do not use it in a proper way, it becomes a killing factor to others. It can spoil a person&rsquo;s appetite; the taste to come to the meeting will be spoiled because what he has heard has not benefited him.</p>
<p>I may have exaggerated a little, but I want us to see the absolute necessity of preparing the right kind of reading material for different meetings. This is in the principle of distributing food according to the proper time. The advancement of the various kinds of meetings hinges on this very matter. Whether or not a meeting brings profit to a person, attracts him, or stirs up the desire within him to join depends fully on this matter.</p>
<p>In 1937 Brother Nee had a co-workers&rsquo; meeting in Hankow to release the messages on <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> I arrived early in Hankow. One day I went to an Episcopalian Church to study its service. I observed the prayers and the sermons. Everything was printed on a sheet of paper. When it was time to pray, the pastor simply turned to the page and read. When the time for the sermon came, he simply read from the pamphlet. That was truly a kind of public reading. It was definitely not in the way of following the Spirit. We cannot follow this way in teaching <em>Truth Lessons.</em>
 On the one hand, we are reading some messages in the meeting, but on the other hand, we do not read them in a formal way like the example of the pastor, assigning one portion for one week, certain material for certain occasions, and praying certain prayers on certain days. We prepare reading material for the meetings because we realize that in the various meetings we cannot expect everyone to be able to deliver a message. In the past the Lord has given us so many riches; our storehouse is full of all kinds of food. As long as we use it in a wise way, we will have more than we need to meet the needs of the saints.</p>
<p>All of us know that during the past years, it was no small achievement for us to have twenty-one meeting halls, each maintaining a message meeting week after week. Now there is no need for us to strain our mind to find the material for a message. We have food in store already. In applying it, however, we should be living and flexible. If we are living and flexible, our delivery will be full of the Spirit. For this reason, we should select the material carefully. This is a matter of life and death. If the material is well selected, others will live. If it is selected poorly, others will die. We can send people home with their hands full or with their hands empty. It all depends on the material we pick. This is a very crucial matter.</p>
<p>I hope we will not listen to the outsiders who slander us. They say, &ldquo;Brother Lee has changed. He does not want others to speak. He only wants people to read his books. In the past he urged people to read the Life-studies. Now he is going one step further; he is asking people to take his messages as reading material in the church meetings. He is doing this to shut everyone&rsquo;s mouth. No one can speak anymore; everyone has to read his messages.&rdquo; I have read some writings that accuse us of discouraging people from reading the Bible and of restricting people to Witness Lee&rsquo;s publications. These are evil words; as Paul says, &ldquo;We are slanderously charged and as some affirm that we say...&rdquo; (Rom. 3:8).</p>
