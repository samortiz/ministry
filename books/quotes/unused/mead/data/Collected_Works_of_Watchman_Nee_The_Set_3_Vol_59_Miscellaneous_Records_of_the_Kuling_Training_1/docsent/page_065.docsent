   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DAVID HONORING THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Saul disobeyed God, he was put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although Saul was still on the throne, in God's eyes he was over.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's intention was for David to be the king.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Out of jealousy, Saul tried very hard to kill David, but David was unwilling to kill Saul in return.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both were anointed by the divine ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, Saul was acting under God's past will, while David was acting under God's present plan and will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both were kings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>David was under God's anointing as well as God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God intended for David to be king, and He also anointed David as king.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was wrong for Saul to oppose David.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How could anyone oppose David as king?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In man's eyes there was nothing wrong with David moving his hand a little to put himself on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was in line with God's will, and God had set Saul aside already.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In God's eyes Saul's kingship was over.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Was it not justifiable for David to help God to remove Saul?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Was it not justifiable for him to assume the kingship sooner and to accomplish God's plan?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's will was for David to be the king.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Was it not right for him to assume the kingship according to God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to man there is nothing wrong with this, but this was not the way David reasoned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1 Samuel 24, while Saul was chasing David in the wilderness of Engedi, Saul entered a cave to relieve himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>David and his men were hiding in the inner part of the cave.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The two enemies crossed paths.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It would have been easy for David to kill Saul then.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He could have thought, "God committed Goliath to my hand at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now He has put Saul in my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is wrong for me to kill him like I killed Goliath?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Had David killed Saul, he would have hastened God's plan in a sense, but by so doing, he would have rebelled against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Saul had failed, he still was the king and God's anointed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although he had failed, David was still under his authority at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>David's killing of Saul would have gained him his kingship at the expense of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This would have put him under a standing of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The proper way was for David to submit to God's authority rather than to His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rebellion had disqualified Saul, and it could have disqualified David as well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Killing Saul would have put him in a wrong position.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was willing to take the right position and risk the danger of being killed by Saul rather than to rebel against God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>David's relationship with Saul was the same as Michael's relationship with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>David dealt with Saul in the same principle that Michael dealt with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>David only said, "May Jehovah judge between me and you" 1 Sam 24:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was truly a person who knew divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was unlike many men today who behave lawlessly and recklessly in the church, in their family, and in society.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If these men were in David's place, ninety-nine and a half out of a hundred would have killed Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must uphold God's principle of authority more than our own existence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May the Lord grant us a little light to see the seriousness of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His authority is a tremendous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God will forever honor His own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to realize how sensitive and delicate the matter of authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It should not be lightly touched.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the very principle governing the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A person cannot say that he only needs to submit to God's direct authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He must first submit to God's appointed deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I wish that heaven would open and light would come to you to show you what God's authority means.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If God has the intention for you to be the king, let Him move His hand and let Him put you on the throne!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must realize how sensitive God's authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You must realize this before you can be a man of light before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once authority is overturned, everything is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may think that there is nothing wrong in your enthusiasm for soul-winning and your zeal for work, but have you touched God's authority?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Saul could have had many reasons for acting as he did.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He could have reasoned, "Agag is not bad.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many of the people of Israel are short of meat, and the sheep and oxen of the Amalekites are so excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What a waste it would be to kill them all!"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was insensitive to the seriousness of the act of rebellion against authority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is where he differed from David.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>David was very sensitive to authority; he upheld authority to the point of almost losing his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Saul, however, had his own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His heart was on the sheep and oxen, and he wanted to offer them as sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead, he sacrificed God's command.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The next incident is recorded in 1 Samuel 26.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Saul and his captains with their choice men sought David in the wilderness of Ziph.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There they camped and slept.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Another temptation was presented before David here.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He easily could have killed Saul, for "a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them" v. 12 . An ignorant Christian would sing "hallelujah" at such a juncture.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He would think that the opportunity to remove Saul had come his way again.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But David only took away Saul's spear and water jug; he let Saul go.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Unless a man has received a great light from the Lord, he can easily reason within himself, "I let him go the first time; that should have justified my innocence.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I was more than fair in letting him go the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Now this time I can surely kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Saul is still coming after me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Now I can kill him."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>David, however, was under a strong light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He dared not rebel against God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He always upheld God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>An authority is always an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our submission to authority must not be affected by our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the only way that we can assume deputy authority ourselves.</S>
