   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After a believer has believed, although he is spirit John 3:6 and also is in the spirit Rom 8:9 , he is not yet spiritual; he is still of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul told the church in Corinth, "And I, brothers he addressed them by such a title because they had already believed in the Lord and were regenerated , was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ" 1 Cor 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although they were already regenerated and "in Christ" v. 1 , "jealousy and strife" were still among them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"For when someone says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men of flesh?" v. 4 . "For you are still fleshly" v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Infants in Christ" 1 Cor 3:1 means that they were regenerated and had become infants.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were joined with Christ and were in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, they did not go on but remained in the rudiments of the beginning of their spiritual life cf.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Heb 5:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They had not grown for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this stage, they had not been developed through practice and were not able to discriminate between good and evil 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They did many things in the flesh and were truly fleshly!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be fleshly means that one is bound by the desires and lusts of the flesh; it means to make "provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts" Rom 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What are the things of the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects, envyings, bouts of drunkenness, carousings, and things like these" Gal 5:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Believers should not commit these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet believers may commit these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the flesh is aroused and the five senses are stirred up, the soul will produce these things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The soul is the strongest part of our being when it comes to the matter of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Infant believers are strong in their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, the soul becomes subject to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A full understanding concerning the application of the power of the cross is lacking in the personality of such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the spirit is weak and unable to rule over the whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan takes this opportunity to come in to stir up the flesh, and the person sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a believer has any of the above sins, he is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a pitiful thing for believers to be of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They repeatedly make up their minds to obey the Lord's will, only to find that they cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are determined to please and serve the Lord in this and that way, yet there is a power in the flesh which urges them to do the things that please the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"For what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do...Now then it is no longer I that work it out, but sin that dwells in me...For to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" Rom 7:15, 17, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the flesh is aroused, a formidable force seems to urge man on until he is forced to unleash the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes he may be urged to satisfy only some physical need and not his lust, yet even that is uncontrollable.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the way the disciples were before Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the night the Lord Jesus was betrayed, they were with Him in the garden of Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord wanted them to be watchful, yet they closed their eyes and went to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This does not mean that they did not love the Lord, nor does it mean that they were not willing to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was because "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak" Matt 26:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their spirits were too weak and unable to rule over their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were subdued by the flesh and were not able to be watchful together with the Lord, but all went to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is usually the case with fleshly believers who do not understand the teaching of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should make one point clear: some behave one way when they are fleshly, and others behave another way when they are fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the church in Corinth, the manifestation of the flesh was in strife and fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the disciples, the manifestation of the flesh was in the inability to subdue the body and be watchful in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although the results produced by the flesh were different, they were nevertheless of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The warfare Paul mentioned in Romans 7 depicts one level in the believers' experience: "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells...I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me...But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wretched man that I am!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who will deliver me from the body of this death?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>18-25 .</S>
