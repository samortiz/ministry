   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RELATION OF 1 CORINTHIANS 12 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE ENTIRE BOOK</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With the foregoing in mind, I would present to you a full picture of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These three chapters that we have been considering, chapters twelve through fourteen, are not an isolated portion but simply a part of the whole message of 1 Corinthians; so we must see them in relationship to the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us take a bird s eye view of the entire book it is vital to our understanding of these three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter one we are told that we have been called into the fellowship of Christ v. 9 . This means that we have been called by God into the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we are told that Christ is God s wisdom and God s power as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter two we are told that this Christ, as God s wisdom and power, as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, is the deep things of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2, 7, 10 ; and if we are going to realize all these deep things of God, we must be in the spirit, we must be spiritual vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>14, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we go on to chapter six, where we are told that he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit v. 17 . We are one spirit with this Christ, who is the power of God, the wisdom of God, and who is also the righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are actually one with Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then in chapter ten we are told that this Christ is our meat, our food and our drink vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>3, 4 ; He is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And finally, in chapter fifteen, we are told that this very Christ has been made a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we put all these points together, we get the full scope of the thought of the Apostle in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the middle of such a book we have this section, chapters twelve through fourteen, dealing with the meetings and the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This reveals to us that if we are going to have the gifts, if we are going to meet in a proper way, we must experience and enjoy the Christ which this book presents; then we will have Him as our life in the spirit in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we come together, then, we need only exercise our spirit to prophesy something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we meet together, we can say something of Him whom we have already experienced and enjoyed in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the way for us to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us put it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the entire context of 1 Corinthians, the proper way for us to meet together is that firstly we must have a daily walk with Christ as our life, with Christ as our enjoyment, with Christ as our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we will have the very love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Love is the expression of Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It includes patience, meekness, endurance, longsuffering, humility; it includes all the virtues of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Love is so all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Love is simply Christ expressed through us as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Love never fails, because love is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes we must change the word love in chapter thirteen of 1 Corinthians into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not Christ, I am become as sounding brass...</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ never fails...Christ is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the excellent way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can never stand up to prophesy in the meetings in a proper way if we are not taking Christ as our life in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are not enjoying Christ as our life day by day, it is impossible to prophesy in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we could, I tell you, we are just pretending.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes when I have offended my wife just a little, before I come to the meeting I must apologize and seek her forgiveness; otherwise, it is rather difficult for me to stand up and function in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without dealing with the matter, there is a hole in my conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On one hand I encourage everyone to prophesy, to function in the meetings, but sometimes you simply cannot do so, because there is not only one hole, but several holes in your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can an electric light bulb give light if there is a hole in it?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If our conscience is not covered by the blood, we have no boldness to rise and prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes people ask how I can be so bold and strong to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is because I have a conscience without offense.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This does not mean that I am perfect, but that I am purged and purified by the cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Put it to the test.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose that today you have told some lies, not big lies, just small ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Try to stand up and function in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you can, you are just pretending.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To prophesy in the meetings depends on our living by Christ in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all can prophesy, but to prophesy in the meetings depends on our living by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not take Christ as our life in our daily walk, it is very difficult to prophesy in the meetings.</S>
