Some say that to live the Christian life is to live in spirit, to live a life according to the spirit, and to know that Christ is our life
Of course, it would be more practical to use only some verses in 2 Corinthians instead of using an entire section
When time allows, we can explain the structure of the Bible, telling them about the Old Testament and the New Testament
Perhaps we would say that the Bible is the word of God, but he may ask why the Bible is the word of God and what the word of God means
We must be careful and thoughtful when we answer the questions of a new believer in order to not introduce more questions
Since we are serving full time, we must be prepared by using the publications and reading the Bible as often as we can
In leading the new believers we must first help them to pray, read the Bible, meet with the saints, and preach the gospel
We should spend more time in preaching the gospel, helping them to be active in approaching non-believers and speaking the gospel
To fellowship with the Lord is to contact the Lord, and such contact with the Lord takes place mainly during our prayer or reading the Bible
The Lord may show us that we are wrong in the way that we treat our parents, our children, our spouse, our neighbors, or our colleagues
After helping them learn to confess their sins, we need to speak to new believers concerning being cleansed by the Lord's precious blood
Verse 9 says, 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
When a believer understands these two verses, he will realize his need to confess his sins and allow God to forgive and cleanse him
We should lead them to confess and deal with their sins and to experience the cleansing of the Lord's precious blood
At this point, some of the new believers may be touched by the Lord's Spirit to present themselves to the Lord
Some may offer themselves in this way, not as a result of the Spirit's leading in life but as the issue of our teaching
According to the life of a normal Christian, after consecration he should learn to walk according to the spirit
After new ones learn to walk according to the spirit, we need to bring them into the anointing, or we may say the teaching of the anointing
We must let them know that by the anointing the Lord gives us a feeling, and we should walk according to this feeling
We need to learn many lessons because our ability to render help to others depends on how much we have experienced the anointing
If we do not have adequate knowledge of the anointing or the teaching of the anointing, we should get help from our publications
We should also lead them to consecrate themselves fully to the Lord, walk according to the spirit, and know the anointing
In the educational system in schools, after learning math and history at the elementary level, we do not need to relearn them later
We may graduate from a school curriculum, but the experiences of our spiritual life are a cycle from which we never graduate
We all have had the experience of being on the altar one moment and coming down from the altar the next moment
Even though a person cannot come down from the cross after being crucified, he can come down from the altar after being on the altar
After consecrating ourselves, we should ask the Lord to have mercy on us and to grant us the grace to walk according to the spirit
There are many verses concerning going to meetings, preaching the gospel, fellowshipping with the Lord, and being enlightened
Taiwan has a rare environment: twenty million people populate this island, there is good transportation, and the level of education is high
After young people consecrate themselves to serve full time, the first thing they need to do is preach the gospel
Others say that the best way is to use the booklet The Mystery of Human Life, which uses four keys to preach the gospel
In particular, those who love the Lord and consecrate themselves to the Lord have a strong desire to preach the gospel
We should pray for the Lord to strengthen the spirit of the gospel within us so that the fire of the gospel would burn among us
If the fire of the gospel is burning within us, we will be burdened when we think of the unbelievers going to the lake of fire
If the fire of the gospel is kindled within us, we will become crazy for the gospel and go everywhere to preach the gospel
Whenever they see an unbeliever, they should be enlivened, even to the point that they forget about eating and care only for the gospel
At a key moment, when this one was about to receive the Lord, another person came into the room and closed his umbrella
Not only should there not be any distractions when we speak the gospel to others, but there is also the matter of timing
Sometimes we should speak with one person concerning only one point and speak with another person concerning a different point
We need to spend time to study the different categories of people so as to learn how to speak with people and which verses to use
Rather, we must observe the situation; only when it is the proper time to pray should we lead a person to pray
In some situations, we need to lead a person to pray sentence by sentence; we pray one sentence, and they repeat the sentence
With one person we may need to kneel down and pray, but with another person we should not compel him to kneel down
In the past we were unable to lead people to salvation, but if we are willing to learn, we will see results within a month
When we preach the gospel, the most important thing for us to learn is how to use the Bible and how to be flexible in using the Bible
We should endeavor to memorize verses and the main points from the books so that we may freely speak the gospel
In particular, in the future the full-timers who are in this training should go to other places to preach the gospel
Recently, a group of five brothers in America went to different places that do not have a church and preached the gospel on the campuses
Question: At present, there is a good response among the college students to the gospel, but it is not easy for them to be baptized
Some students feel that to be baptized is to join a religion and are concerned about the opposition from their family
A person will respond one way when he feels cold in one setting and differently when he feels warm in another setting
Since they have recently been saved, it is not possible for them to know the Bible well or to have read many spiritual books
We have the materials, but we need some saints to dig out the treasures, to digest them, and to compile them into booklets or tracts
We should digest the main points of the truth and turn them into simple words so that we can speak the truth to the children
If a person cannot write the standard type properly, he will be unable to write in running style, in script type, or in seal type
The young people who are learning to serve the Lord should practice according to rules so that they can lay a good foundation
When a carpenter wants to make furniture, he starts off with a big pile of wood, and each piece of wood varies in texture and size
A carpenter who randomly selects a piece of wood will waste time cutting it to the right size, proving that he is not a trained carpenter
There are many verses in the Bible concerning prayer in the Christian life, but which verses should we use with new believers?
Philippians 46 says In nothing be anxious but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God
Using these verses to teach new believers to pray is the same as being in the denominations and teaching people to recite the Lord's prayer
Even Matthew 7:7-8, which says, 'Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you
Acts 2:42 says, 'They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers'
Three thousand new believers continued steadfastly in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread, and in prayer
Salvation includes forgiveness of sins, cleansing from sins, justification, reconciliation to God, and regeneration
Which is the first item that we experience justification forgiveness of sins cleansing from sins reconciliation regeneration or salvation
Some of you may think that it is good enough to lead people to salvation and question why you need to learn these items
While preaching the gospel, one evangelist spoke about the precious blood washing his heart and the precious blood leaking out
It was difficult for those who were saved to be led further in the growth in life because his understanding of the truth was not accurate
In Shangtung Province of northern China many believers in the Pentecostal movement were able to lead people to salvation
Learning to recognize and clearly pronounce each letter of the alphabet will be a solid foundation toward your learning English
There are two different stages of sanctification: sanctification before salvation and sanctification after salvation
God chose us in eternity, in time the Holy Spirit separates us through His sanctifying work, and then the blood is sprinkled on us
Medical students are required to spend several years studying fundamental courses concerning the structure and composition of the human body
A medical student must acquire this basic knowledge so that he will not make mistakes in his diagnosis or prescription
When we are clear concerning the contents of God's salvation, we will have confidence when we preach the gospel
It is not until a person is reconciled with God that the Spirit of God can enter into him and put God's life in him
In Acts 16:31 Paul and Silas said to the jailer in Philippi, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household'
Salvation in these two verses refers to sanctification, forgiveness, cleansing, justification, release, reconciliation, and regeneration
To cut straight the word of the truth means to unfold the word of God in its various parts rightly and straightly without distortion
In Acts 2:37-38 after the Jews heard the gospel, they were pricked in their heart, and they asked the disciples what they should do
Even though we read Romans 10:13 and Mark 16:16, because of the poor behavior of many Christians, he questioned this salvation
After a person is genuinely saved by believing in the Lord and calling on His name, we should not rejoice and walk away from him
In order to 'tie a tight and secure knot' for someone who is newly saved, we need to help him have the assurance of salvation
John 10:28-29 says, 'I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand
According to these verses, there are two hands-the hand of the Lord and the hand of the Father-holding us; hence, our salvation is secure
An example is verse 12, which says, 'He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life'
Another is John 1:12: 'As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
We can tell him that by these words he knows that he has the life of God, and he also has the authority to become a child of God
There are many words concerning the assurance of our salvation in chapters 1 3 4 and 5 of the Gospel of John as well as in Pauls Epistles
Nee said that it is not easy to call a fatherinlaw Dad but it is very sweet to call our own father Dad because we are born of our father
We know this because the Bible says, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household'
Now that we are saved, not only do we love the brothers and sisters in the Lord in our country, but we also love those in other countries
In helping new believers to have the assurance of their salvation, we should present these three aspects as proof
We should then encourage him to call on the name of the Lord in order to experience more of the Lord's salvation
Before a person is saved, he does not feel bad when he lies; rather, he might even boast of this as if it were a skill
Before our salvation we took it for granted that we would lose our temper but after we are saved we feel sorry whenever we lose our temper
If after a person is 'saved' he never feels bad when he sins, it is likely that he is a 'tare,' a false believer
We should read all the books that cover this subject such as Assurance of Salvation and chapter 15 in Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures
In order to help new believers have the assurance of their salvation, we need to lead them to see their title deed in the Bible
If a believer does not have the assurance of his salvation, it will be very difficult for him to make spiritual progress
After leading someone to salvation, we must first perfect him by letting him know that he is saved, and we must give him the title deed
There are three aspects of this foundation the outward proofGods word the inward proofGods Spirit and the proof of our experience of life
The inflection of our voice and the speed of our speaking also have an impact on the effectiveness of our speaking
In order to preach the gospel, we need to speak; in order to edify the saints, we need to speak; when we visit people, we also need to speak
Although it cannot be said that this is a fixed rule, we should not neglect these matters when we shepherd new believers
If we are well equipped in these three basic matters, we will have results when we contact people with the gospel
Being late to a meeting is the worst habit that a Christian can have it indicates disrespect to the Lord and indifference toward the meeting
If the president were to come to the meeting or if he were to invite us to attend a gathering, we would never be late
If we do not make mistakes now, we will make a mistake later in our life, but by then it may be too late to be adjusted
Many of the brothers and sisters who came to serve were either high school graduates or were studying in college
In addition to these items we should lead the new ones to experience Christ as life, that is, to know that Christ is their life
In other words, as soon as we are regenerated, the Holy Spirit enters into us and imparts the divine life into us
We can even take them a step further and tell them that John 3:36 says, 'He who believes into the Son has eternal life'
He is the heavenly Christ on the throne of God, and He is also the pneumatic Christ in our spirit to be our life
Otherwise, it will be difficult to lead them to live Christ, to live in the life of Christ, and to experience Christ as life
We have given many messages concerning this matter, including messages in the Life-studies of the New Testament
When you want to have an argument or are about to get angry, you should not act according to your mind or your emotion
Pray-reading the Word will help them to turn away from so many people, things, and matters that are outside the Lord and to turn to the Lord
In Galatians 2:20 he says that Christ lives in us, and in verse 19 of chapter 4 he says that Christ is being formed in us
We will remain in the church, participate in the church life, and live in the Body, coordinating and serving in harmony with all the saints
Experiencing Christ as life is the foundation not only of our spiritual life but also of our coordination and service in the church
We should speak clearly concerning regeneration and let the new believer know that through regeneration Christ lives in him to be his life
He told them to learn to be joined to the Lord in every matter and to live according to the inner sense of life by calling on the Lords name
Strictly speaking, however, in order for these practices to be proper, they must be the manifestation of experiencing Christ as life
If we do not walk and live according to the indwelling Spirit, all the outward teaching concerning our character becomes regulation
If we walk according to the Spirit and live Christ, what we live out will correspond to the teaching concerning character
The cultivation of a person's character, at most, can develop the bright virtue, as taught by Chinese ethical philosophers
If we truly walk according to the Spirit, the standard of our living will be higher than the standard of human morality
When we serve in the brothers' or sisters' houses, we should not make outward demands, such as allotting a specific space for their towels
If we walk according to the Spirit, even if there is no outward regulation, the Lord would lead us to keep the basins clean
They would say maxims, such as 'When eating, do not talk,' and 'The mouth is the primary source of calamities'
Our living and conduct are not according to the cultivation of ethical philosophers or maxims passed down from older generations
The cultivation of character taught by ethical philosophers is dead in nature; it is merely an improvement in one's behavior
We should lead them to experience the Holy Spirit and the cross, that is, to experience the Spirit of life and the cross
Based on our study, knowledge, and experience of the truth in the Bible in the last thirty years, this matter has become clear to us
If we live Christ and experience Christ as life, we will see that the Christ whom we experience is the Spirit of life
At that time we saw only the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2; we did not see the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45
The emphasis of the Spirit of life is related to the truth, whereas the emphasis of the life-giving Spirit is related to experience
From the ministry of Brother Nee we see that in order to experience the death and resurrection of Christ, we must experience life
He said that the fact of our co-death with Christ in Romans 6 can be experienced only in the Spirit of life in Romans 8
The Lord entered into resurrection after His death; hence, the element of resurrection was also added to the Spirit of God
In order to experience Christ, we must know that Christ is the life-giving Spirit with many elements; He is the compound Spirit
In our experience the all-inclusive compound Spirit manifests mainly the element of the all-inclusive death, that is, the cross of Christ
Penn-Lewis did not point out why we experience the death of Christ when we have the infilling of the Holy Spirit
According to this type there was only the Spirit of God, typified by the olive oil, before the tabernacle was built
From the incarnation of the Lord Jesus until His resurrection the four elementstypified by the four spiceswere mingled with the Holy Spirit
Through the picture of the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30 we are able to know the compound Spirit thoroughly
The Spirit that was not yet in John 7:38-39 is in 2 Corinthians 3:17, where Paul says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
When we experience Christ as our life we experience the allinclusive Spirit and an important element in the allinclusive Spirit is the cross
When we experience Christ as our life, the element of Christ's death in His life spontaneously has a killing effect within us
Regrettably, they did not have the light that we have today in order to analyze and clearly explain this experience
Later it was discovered that their excellent eyesight was the result of their regularly eating a particular fish in their diet
Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and in the Spirit is the element of Christ's death that will kill every negative feeling within us
When we experience the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ, our growth in life will deepen
If we are short in experience, we will not have a thorough understanding, even if we have read many spiritual books
The Spirit of God had only the element of divinity but through the Lords incarnation the element of humanity was added to the Spirit of God
The Lord Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, and the element of human living was added to the Spirit
Humanity was added to the Spirit through the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, and human living was added through His living as a man
The saying going through wind and frost means that a person experiences many hardships and sufferings many elements have been added into him
After a long period of silence at the beginning of the meeting, Brother Nee said, 'The situation today is very clear
Within five to six years there was a hundredfold increase; that is, the original four hundred grew to about forty thousand
If Brother Nee was not able to convince him concerning the practicality of the church, how could we persuade him?
Not long afterward they brought this matter up again, saying that they needed the spiritual portion from Brother Austin-Sparks
The brother who requested the time of fellowship asked Brother Austin-Sparks what he thought about our work, since this was his second visit
Please tell me, why do the brothers who are in the military service put their caps on before they leave the meeting hall'?
When it was announced that the meeting was over, the brothers in the military would put on their caps while leaving their seats
According to Western custom however a man should never put on his hat while he is inside a building there is no exception for the military
After Brother Austin-Sparks's question, a brother explained, 'According to Chinese custom, soldiers wear their caps everywhere
After Brother Austin-Sparks heard this, he asked, 'Do you act in accordance to your custom or in accordance to the Bible'?
After all seven baskets were distributed, the seven deacons lined up and returned the empty baskets one by one to Brother Austin-Sparks
Brother Austin-Sparks received the baskets, took a piece of bread, and said, 'Now we will partake of this bread together'
If we compare their bread-breaking meeting with our bread-breaking meeting, ours would certainly appear disorderly to Brother Austin-Sparks
Rather, it would be better to let him carry out his spiritual ministry and render the supply of his portion to us
One evening as we sat in silence a brother said Brother AustinSparks suppose there are five groups in Taipei that meet in the Lords name
Suppose at that time a prophet arose and said, 'It is right that we worship, pursue, and love God, but we do not need to return to Jerusalem
Can we say that because of his substantial spiritual weight his being in organized Christianity was also relatively right'?
In his message he said emphatically, 'You make Christ a small Christ and the church a small church in order to fit your local ground'
After the messages were released, the majority of the brothers and sisters became clear and began to stress the ground of the church
The light that we received from the Lord caused some believers in traditional Christianity to rise up to oppose us
They also asserted that calling on the Lord's name and pray-reading the Lord's Word were derived from Oriental Buddhism
Three hundred fifty churches have been raised up in North America, South America, Central America, Africa, Australia, and Europe
Our Lord Jesus was incarnated, lived a human life in His humanity for thirty-three and a half years, died, resurrected, and ascended
Through His death and resurrection, the two elements of human nature-including human living-and death were added to the Spirit
It was there that the heavenly Father gave Peter a revelation, and he answered, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God'
The Lord Jesus had to take His disciples away from the thick religious atmosphere to Caesarea Philippi, where everything was clear
Regarding the Lords person He is the Son of the living God and regarding His commission and ministry He is the Christ Gods anointed One
The Son of the living God speaks of the Lord's person, and the Christ speaks of His commission, His duty, His ministry
The Son of the living God and the Christ mean that the One who expresses God and is the embodiment of God came to accomplish God's economy
The word and at the beginning of the verse is crucial; it indicates that verse 18 is a continuation of verse 17
As long as we lead people to salvation and to live the Christian life, we must also lead them to experience the anointing
In the anointing we experience Christ as life and we also experience the allinclusive lifegiving Spirit and the allinclusive death of Christ
On the cross Christ 'slept,' and from His pierced side life flowed out , signified by the water, to produce the church
The New Testament shows two important matters concerning the church: producing and accomplishing, that is, life and building
He is also the Christ, who came to accomplish God's economy-to produce the church and to build up His unique Body as His unique counterpart
If a brother sins against you, you should go and reprove him between you and him alone to gain and recover him
He then goes on to say that if the brother refuses to hear the church, 'Let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector'
From the context of chapter 18, we know that the church spoken of in verse 17 is involved with administration and management
The universal church is uniquely one, and the local church in every locality is the expression of the one universal church
Not only do pastors find it difficult to accept that there is only one church in one city, but ordinary Christians also do not accept this
In leading new believers to know the church, we must first use 16:18, which speaks of the universal aspect of the church
When we speak with others concerning spiritual matters, we must also give them a deep impression so that they can see a vision
We must lead them out of Jerusalem with its religious atmosphere to Caesarea Philippi, where the atmosphere is clear
We must impress the new believers that even though they do not know the truth, they can enter into the truth through our speaking
When we speak the truth, we should not be afraid of repetition; rather, we should be afraid of digressing to different points
Only when we are in Caesarea Philippi can we receive revelation to know who Christ is and what He has accomplished
Based on our knowledge of Christ, we can become a living stone, and the Lord will call us 'Peter,' which means 'stone' in Greek
The kingdom is always related to spiritual warfare, and the result of warfare is the defeat of the gates of Hades
In chapter 18 the Lord showed the disciples how to maintain a good relationship among the brothers in the local church
If the church does not have an expression in a locality, there will be no way for the brothers to be reconciled
The church being expressed in different localities is similar to the one unique moon being seen in many places on earth
If the relationship among the brothers is not right, there will be problems in the expression of a local church
If there is no confession, there will be no forgiveness, and the local expression of the church will fall apart
If as a result of this friction we become offended and do not confess our mistakes, we will not have the practical living of a local church
The local church life is maintained by confessing to one another, forgiving one another, and forbearing one another
When leading new believers to know the church, we first should let them know that Christ is the life and nature of the church
In the new man, which is the church, there is no Jew, no Greek, no high culture, no low culture, no slave, and no free man
At this point we can quote Ephesians 5:23-32 concerning the church being the wife of Christ and Christ being the Husband of the church
Ephesians 1:23 refers to the church in verse 22, saying that it is 'His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all'
The church comes out of Christ, and the life and nature of the church are Christ; hence, the church is Christ's Body
If the Lord touches him, later it will be easy for him to receive what we say about other matters, such as the church
If we can always give others spiritual help, they will be impressed with us; they will also be grateful to us and appreciate us
Once the person we are speaking with harbors a negative feeling toward us, it will be difficult to continue the conversation
We must not give new believers the impression that we are condemning others' faults or criticizing their shortcomings
We should speak only as much as others can receive so that they will receive the supply and be left with a good impression
In this way the people whom we contact will receive what we minister; they will be able to receive further help from us
The church as the Body of Christ is for His expression, and the church as the bride of Christ is for His satisfaction
In Ephesians 2 4 and 6 we see that the church is also the new man and the warrior both of which are for the accomplishment of Gods purpose
The truth is not centered on baptism or love but on the great mystery of godliness-God manifested in the flesh
The church does not teach concerning morality and ethics or religious rituals or ceremonies, such as baptism and bread-breaking
When speaking concerning the church being God's house, we must point out these three items: life, living, and expression
In Matthew 16 the Lord first spoke of the church and then of the kingdom, showing that the church is God's kingdom
Chapter 16 shows that the church is a matter of life, and then it shows that the kingdom is a matter of living
Verse 17 says, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
The kingdom of God is the church life, which is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit
The kingdom of God is Christ as a seed sown into God's chosen people to grow and expand within them into a sphere, a realm
In Revelation 1:9 John says, 'I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus'
The new man is for the living that can fulfill God's will, and the warrior is for dealing with God's enemy and bringing in God's kingdom
In chapter 3 the created man became fallen and corrupted to become the old man and therefore departed from God
In this way we express God on earth and accomplish His will on earth for the fulfilling of His original purpose in creating man
Receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition'
In this portion of the Scripture there are six items of the armor of God that need to be put on, and every item is Christ
According to what has been entrusted to us by the Lord, we insist on following absolutely the truths revealed in the Bible
Criticism that says that we do not cooperate with other believers is according to human sentiments and outward situations
The church is the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, the new man, and the warrior
We must present the nature of the church so that believers have a clear understanding of the biblical revelation of the church
Once a believer has this understanding, he has to admit that Christianity is full of division and far from this standard
At present there are more than a thousand Christian groups in Taiwan, and each group has its own practices, doctrine, and flavor
If you are a person who does not know the truth, when you hear this kind of speaking, you may think that it makes sense
Especially after Pentecostalism was raised up in the twentieth century, Christianity has been dividing into more sects
The leaven, mixture, in the Catholic Church, such as the worship of saints and relics, was taken from pagan practices
Division and confusion make it impossible for the Lord's desire to be satisfied; thus, there is a need for recovery
God does not care for a unity that is outward, superficial, political, or of human maneuvering and arrangement
Since we were raised up by the Lord to take His way, we need to return to the proper ground, the ground of oneness
Since the Body of Christ is one , our standing testifies to the universe, to the unbelievers, and to the devil that we are one
Due to physical limitations of time and space, we cannot meet with all the believers on the earth at the same time in the same place
Many Christians preach the gospel and lead new believers to know the Bible, to know life, and to know the truth
Our attitude toward people must not be rude, and our presentation of the truth must be proper and candid; we do not hide anything
In Matthew 18:20 the Lord said that where there are two or three gathered into His name, there He is in their midst
The Bible says that the Father 'causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust'
If the evil can receive sunshine and the unjust are watered by the rain, the children of God can have the Lord's presence
At the fullness of the times, God brought His people back to Jerusalem and charged them to rebuild His temple on this ground
Which group of people was more spiritual: those who were moved by God to return to Jerusalem or those who remained in Babylon?
We must humbly confess that there are many of God's children who love the Lord more than we do and are more spiritual than we are
May the Lord help us to understand this basic truth so that in our attitude and practice we will be a proper testimony
We should not have confidence in ourselves, thinking that we have a clear vision and that there will not be any problems
Let us consider how to maintain a proper relationship with Christians who do not meet with us on the one ground
We know that God's economy is for the Triune God to be dispensed into His chosen people so that they may be His corporate testimony on earth
If we know this and see this, we will treasure the ground on which we stand, and we will not be deceived to leave the ground of oneness
At the opportune time we will bring all God's children to this ground of oneness so that they may participate in the Lord's recovery
Although there are good things in Christianity, in relation to the ground of the church it has deviated from God's original intention
Through the Spirit's regenerating, saturating, and filling, we have the hope of being in the likeness of Christ
The Father is the Originator of the Body, the Son is the Creator of the Body, and the Spirit is the Executor of the Body
Even though we are in the oneness of the Spirit, we still need to arrive at the oneness of the faith in practicality
Acts 8:1 speaks of the church in Jerusalem, 13:1 speaks of the church in Antioch, and 1 Corinthians 1:2 speaks of the church in Corinth
Acts 14:23 speaks of appointing elders in 'every church,' and Titus 1:5 speaks of appointing elders in 'every city'
If we put these two verses together, we see that appointing elders in every city is the same as appointing elders in every church
Even if the whole world rises up to oppose us, as long as we stand on the Lord's Word, we are standing on the truth
The Bible does not say that we should love only the brothers who are meeting with us, the brothers in the local churches
Whether or not a person stands on the proper ground of the church depends on the truth and light he receives from the Lord
We should believe that if a believer receives life and the truth, sooner or later he will seek after the church
At that time, we should present the matter of the church to him so that he can choose the way he wants to take
A believer may choose to take this way, or he can remain where he is and serve the Lord according to the light he has received
Question: Why do we not participate in joint gospel preaching with other Christian groups on college campuses or with the denominations?
In their practice of unity, each group is maintained as a separate unit and unites with other groups for a particular activity
On the surface, it seems that we are separating ourselves from other believers; however, it is they who have separated themselves from us
On the one hand, we do not take part in the ground of division; on the other hand, we accept all Christians in the denominations
Question: Should we wait until our gospel friends ask us about the church, or should we take the initiative to speak to them?
The truths in the New Testament include God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem
Whether or not other believers are prejudiced against us or the new ones are damaged, eventually, the truth will prevail
Through the words released in this ministry, we see Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
The Lord has commissioned us to preach the gospel and to lead new believers to know that the church is His heart's desire
Wherever a church is raised up, even if there are only eight or ten saints, we should immediately practice the small groups
When we began practicing the small groups, we led the saints to drop religion, rituals, regulations, and doctrine
If we want the Lord's recovery to advance quickly and spread widely and to be established and rooted, we must carry out these four matters
In every place we must be diligent to practice the small groups, to dive into the truth, to preach the gospel, and to produce full-timers
An example of a basic goal is to preach the gospel to save souls that is to bring people to the Lord Jesus for the salvation of their souls
We do not need to become experts or to obtain an advanced degree, but we need to learn and make progress every day
Since those who do not serve the Lord are learning English, we, as the Lord's workers, have a greater need to know English
Its discussions on international treaties and the various issues among the nations rendered much knowledge on international affairs
Many Chinese people are at a disadvantage when they go abroad because they lack language abilities and an international perspective
We should not be in a hurry to spread to other places; rather, we should learn here in Taiwan and seek to improve
Today the Lord's recovery is on all five continents of the world; the pioneers are already there, cutting the way for us
We know so much truth, and the church is rich in resources; however, in the past decades we have not exceeded one hundred churches in Taiwan
We have the complete set of Life-studies in front of us, but not many of us have entered into the riches they contain
They need to know how to inherit from those who have gone before us and how to inspire those who will follow us
Our greatest weakness and problem are that we hold on to the old things and are not willing to learn and to change
A person who serves the Lord should have a clear goal for his life and should make progress and continually learn
According to the standard of the New Testament revelation, those who serve the Lord are persons who have seen the heavenly vision
No one preached the gospel to him; rather, the Lord Jesus appeared to him personally from heaven and preached the gospel to him
In his youth Paul was educated in Greek culture; he was further trained at the feet of Gamaliel in the strictest sect of Judaism
Such a proud and outstanding person did not consider fishermen, such as Peter and John, to be persons of importance
We may be engaged with a certain matter and occupied by it, but at the appointed time the Lord will come to meet us
He picked up the Bible and read Psalm 1 Blessed is the man Who does not walk In the counsel of the wicked Nor stand on the path of sinners
It may seem that some were confused when they chose their spouses, and others may regret their choice of occupation
Eventually, when we take everything into account, we must admit that it is the Lord who has directed our lives
It may seem that we are the ones who have chosen the way we have taken in life; however, it is altogether foreordained by God
Even more, He has commissioned us to be His dispensers, and He desires that we would become vessels filled with Christ
One brother gave a testimony and said that when he was backslidden, he prayed and told the Lord that he would eventually return
He said that in the Lord's eyes one day of absence is nothing, because the Lord sees a thousand years as one day
Some believers think that a person can serve the Lord full time either for life or for a temporary period of time
Even though there may be times when we have second thoughts, God chose us and called us, and this is irrevocable
Whether we are strong or weak overcoming or failing is secondary only one thing is certainwe shall be dispensers of Jesus for our whole life
We even scheme about how to function in a meeting, and we testify with a specific intention that does not come from our spirit
He made a whip out of cords and drove the moneychangers and those selling oxen and sheep and doves out of the temple
Although Paul speaks many profound truths in the first sections of Romans at the end he still tells us to live a life of the highest virtues
When there is a need for love, our love will be in the spirit, and when there is a need for meekness, our meekness will be in the spirit
Just as humans cannot live apart from a community, so Christians also cannot live apart from a 'community,' the church
According to God's ordination, we cannot live apart from a community as humans, and we cannot stay away from the church as Christians
A person who serves the Lord must have a proper relationship and proper contact with those both in society and in the church
When he begins school, he will have teachers, who are above him, and classmates, who are at his level and above or below him
Since God created us and saved us, we should learn to have a proper relationship and proper contact with others in society and in the church
The relationships within a community began with the descendants of Adam and Eve, but the first relationship was that of a male and a female
A parent-child relationship is not a matter of our own choice, but the male-female relationship involves a choice
On the other hand, although we are the new man, in the church life the differences between males and females are still present
The more modest we are, the higher the standard of morality we will have and the greater will be our protection
A proper person should be very modest and be limited in the places he goes, the people he knows, and the things that he says
When we walk according to the Spirit, we will have no need for anyone to teach us, but His anointing will teach us concerning all things
In particular, the sisters should not forget that they are females when they contact people; they are not free to speak carelessly
In human communities as well as in the church, we must remember that there is a difference between males and females
The two greatest temptations in human life are related to money and to relationships between males and females
It is also impossible for a Christian living in the church life to not have contact with the brothers and sisters
Take the following portion as an example: 'The Son of God as the embodiment and expression of God the Father is life to us
The desire of God's heart is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life , and become the sons of God '
One person should read, 'The Son of God,' and another person can continue with 'as the embodiment and expression of God the Father'
We should practice reading only a phrase or a clause, and immediately another person should continue with the next phrase or clause
From the previous example the phrases the Son of God the embodiment and the expression are quite particular and should be read with emphasis
To read a short portion with repetition and emphasis is a matter of skill, but to read with vitality depends on our person, not our skill
In a small group, nothing should be excessive or too long, even though we practice everything in the small group
There is much enjoyment when the food is brought to the table one dish at a time and eaten one course at a time
We compiled a new hymnal with select hymns from past hymnals, new hymns, and various hymns in English that were translated into Chinese
It is a great opportunity and a blessing for a young person to serve the Lord full time at this juncture of our history
In these verses the apostles charge is related to not teaching things that are different from Gods economy in the environment of the church
According to Acts 2:41-42, three thousand new believers 'continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles'
To speak differently from the speaking of the apostles, in contradiction to God's New Testament economy, is to teach different things
Similarly, a Christian needs to live in a clean environment so that he can grow and have a healthy spiritual life
In 1957 and 1958 the air in the churches in Taiwan was contaminated by different teachings, and as a result, many saints were damaged
Paul also reminded Timothy how to conduct himself with elderly men and elderly women and how to contact younger women in all purity
The Chinese say that 'one who stays near vermillion will be stained red, and one who stays near ink will be stained black'
If those who live with you are black eventually even if you are white you will become black because you are in close contact with them
We should budget our time and prepare a schedule of what to do in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening for each day of the week
A schedule enables us to use our time effectively, and it causes our pursuit of the truth, our service, and our work to be definite
Once they enter the military camp, they have a tight daily schedule; even the time needed for them to make their beds is calculated
A teacher is also restricted; the school schedules which day of the week, at what time, and in which classroom he teaches
There are also those whose disposition is pure and simple; they do not get involved, even if they encounter 'hair and dust'
For the sake of our protection and benefit, we need to have two or three companions to support and help us and whom we support and help
A person who serves the Lord has a relationship not only with his community and with the church but also with his fellow workers
Just as one person cannot play ball alone but must play with others as a team so a person cannot serve the Lord alone he must have coworkers
It is not enough for one who serves the Lord to have a proper relationship only with the community and the church
There is still another relationship that is more direct than the relationship with the community and with the church
We should not think that having a problem with those who coordinate with us is only a personal matter that will not affect others
If we have truly received and learned something from the Lord, others will be willing to receive the supply from us, wherever we are
In the coordination we should not have the thought that if one place does not suit us, we can move to another place
As a result of fellowship and communication among the churches, the saints in the new locality will not be supportive
In another ten or twenty years the Lord will lead many among us to go abroad to other continents and work for Him
We should maintain a good relationship with the unbelieving ones in our community; we should not be rude to them
Concerning our relatives we should conduct ourselves according to the teaching of the Bible and try our best to maintain a good relationship
We should not have a different attitude toward the saints who do not meet with us; rather, we should maintain a good relationship with them
On the one hand, the saints should pray for the co-workers who go out to labor for the Lord, and the saints should support them financially
The church cannot go with us, but the Lord is going with us and the prayers of the saints will go with us as well
When we go to a new place, we must learn to establish a good fellowship with the local saints and maintain a proper relationship with them
The kind of people we will contact when we go out and the way to contact them are the matters that will need further prayer
There is a representative body with its councilmen, and there are administrative units with their respective officers
When he is burdened for the propagation, he must first fellowship concerning his burden with the ones whom he serves with
There will always be adverse circumstances when we go out in a pioneering way, because no one has paved the way for us
Some of the older retired saints have finished their family obligations are willing to serve full time and are burdened for the propagation
