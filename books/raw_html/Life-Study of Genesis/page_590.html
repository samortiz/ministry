<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(f) His Majesty Being like the Firstborn of His Ox,<br>and His Horns Being like the Horns of the Wild Ox</H2><P>Deuteronomy 33:17 says, "His majesty is like the firstborn of his ox, and his horns are like the horns of a wild ox: with them he shall push the peoples together to the ends of the earth: and these are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh" (Heb.). Joseph was strong, like the firstborn of the ox. This ox has two horns. One was Ephraim, and the other was Manasseh. With these two horns the ox pushes together the peoples to the ends of the earth. This also is a picture of Christ. Christ is a strong ox with two horns, pushing the peoples together as He desires. This will take place at the Lord's coming back. Today the peoples are scattered and spreading. But the day will come when Christ as the strong ox will push the peoples together. He may say, "Russians and other nations, don't spread yourselves out. I shall push you together to the ends of the earth." Remember, Genesis 49 is a prophetic record of the entire history of God's people, beginning with sinners and ending with the Christ who inherits all things and takes over the whole earth. Christ is not only fruitful, victorious, and blessed to the uttermost; He is also full of strength to push the peoples on earth according to His purpose.</P><P>For centuries, the Russians, inhabitants of a cold region, have been trying to spread to the south, to the Mediterranean Sea. When they tried to reach the Persian Gulf, the British fought them back. Then they built the Siberian railroad to the Far East in order to reach the sea, and after that they constructed the Manchurian railroad to the Pacific. But the British helped the Japanese to defeat them. Today the Russians are trying to penetrate the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. For this reason, Egypt is very important. The hidden intention of the Russians is to take over the good land, including Jerusalem. But eventually Christ, the strong ox, will come with two horns and push the Russians back to the northern region. He may say, "Russians, your destiny is to live in a cold region. Do not try to come down to the Mediterranean Sea, which is reserved eternally for My people." This strong ox will push back the Russians and other peoples to the uttermost. If you think I am speaking nonsense, I ask you to wait and see. Sooner or later, this will happen. The crucial center of international relations today is the Middle East, and many nations want to spread into that region. But Joseph, the strong ox, will come with the ten thousands of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh to push the peoples back to the ends of the earth. He may say, "Get away from the Mediterranean Sea. This region is for My people. You must not come here!"</P>
