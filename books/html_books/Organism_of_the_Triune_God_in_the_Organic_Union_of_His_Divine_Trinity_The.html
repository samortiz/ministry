<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> This small book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee during the weekend of September 2-5, 1988 in Cleveland, Ohio.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4; 1:4-5, 7-11, 13-14, 19-23</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
BEING ABSOLUTELY ORGANIC</h2>
<p>The burden of these messages is to point out that the church is absolutely organic. We need to see that the church as the Body of Christ is altogether organic, absolutely of life, with nothing organizational. The Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God. The Triune God has an organism. An organism and an organization are entirely different. To illustrate this difference, we may compare a living person to a wooden stand. The wooden stand is without life, while a living person is full of life. The wooden stand is an organization of pieces of wood put together, but a living person has many members which are joined together organically. A person is a living, moving, functioning organism, unlike a robot, which is an organization of inorganic parts. The church is not an organization without life, but an organism with life.</p>
<p>One of the most damaging things to the church is organization. History tells us that nothing kills, damages, and annuls the reality of the church as much as organization does. Some may think that the appointment of the elders is something organizational. They may feel that an appointment is always something organizational. We must realize, however, that the elders are appointed according to the manifestation of the measure of their growth in the divine life. To appoint a principal of a school or a manager in a corporation is not according to life. This kind of appointment is organizational. But in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, according to the New Testament, the appointment of the elders is absolutely according to the growth in life. If a brother does not have the adequate growth in life, he cannot be an elder. According to their physical life, older people are elders. Their age comes from their growth in their physical life. Their being elders is an organic matter. In like manner, the elders in the churches are appointed according to the manifestation of the measure of their growth in the divine life. The appointment of the elders is altogether organic, having nothing to do with organization.</p>
<p>To even mention the word organization concerning the church and the church life is wrong. The church and the church life are not in the field of organization. The Apostle Paul told us that the church is God&rsquo;s farm (1 Cor. 3:9). Anything that grows on a farm does not belong to an organization. Rice or wheat cannot be organized by a farmer to grow in a certain way. A farmer plants the seed and then waters what he has planted. His work on the farm is something of life. Planting and watering are matters of life. Paul said, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:6). The church as God&rsquo;s farm, God&rsquo;s cultivated land, is something totally of life, having nothing to do with organization. Paul also tells us that the church is God&rsquo;s building (3:9). A physical building is something of organization because it is composed of lifeless materials. But the church as God&rsquo;s building is not a lifeless building. It is a building full of life. The divine life is the basic and unique factor of all the building materials of this spiritual building, God&rsquo;s house. God&rsquo;s house is an organic matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
FOR HIS FULLNESS, HIS EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>The organism of the Triune God is a Body (Eph. 4:4). The very abstract and mysterious God has an organism. God is invisible, yet He has a visible organism, the Body of Christ. The church as the Body of Christ is for His fullness, His expression. The definition of the church as the fullness of Christ may be illustrated by a cup that is filled with water to the extent that it overflows with water. The water within the cup is seen and expressed when it overflows from the cup. The overflow of the water is the fullness of the water, and the fullness of the water is the expression of the water that is inside the cup. John 1:16 says, &ldquo;For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; We received of the fullness of the incarnated Christ who came as grace and truth (v. 17). The Word became flesh, and He was full of grace and truth (v. 14). The fullness of grace and truth is the fullness of the incarnated Christ. To fill a cup with water until it overflows is to have &ldquo;water upon water.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus was full of grace, grace upon grace. Of His fullness we all have received grace upon grace. The fullness is the expression of the riches. A person&rsquo;s body is his fullness, his expression. A husky American man who has enjoyed so much of the rich foodstuffs of America, the riches of America, may be considered as the fullness of America, the expression of America. The church as the Body of Christ is the expression, the fullness, of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING AN ORGANISM</h2>
<p>The Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God, and this organism is an issue of the divine Trinity. Genesis 2 shows that Eve was an issue of Adam. While Adam was sleeping, God took a rib out of his side, and with this rib He built a woman (v. 22). The rib that issued out of Adam&rsquo;s side eventually became Eve. Eve was an issue out of Adam. In like manner, the church as the organism of the Triune God is the issue of the divine Trinity. The organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, is an issue of the Father as the source of the divine Trinity, an issue of the Son as the course of the divine Trinity, and an issue of the Spirit as the consummation of the flow of the divine Trinity. We need to see these three aspects of this divine, wonderful, marvelous, excellent issue. This issue is of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. Our God is not that simple. The Bible tells us that God is triune. He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet He is one unique God. Just as a river has a source, a course, and a flow, the Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow of the divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">An Issue of the Father<br />
as the Source of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<h2 class="head3">In His Selection of the Saints</h2>
<p>The organism of the Triune God is an issue of the Father as the source of the divine Trinity in His selection of the saints that they may share His holy nature to be holy (Eph. 1:4). God the Father, in His Son, the Christ, has chosen us to be holy. For us to be holy requires that we share His holy nature. In the entire universe, the only holy One is God. No one is holy except God Himself. He chose some persons created by Him to be holy as He is. These chosen ones can be holy only by partaking of God. God desires to impart Himself as the very holy nature into us. When we partake of His holy nature, His holy nature will be mingled with our being, transforming us into His likeness, which is holy and without blemish. As God&rsquo;s chosen ones, we will be like gems without any blemishes, or foreign particles. To be holy is to share God&rsquo;s holy nature without any mixture. This implies an impartation, a dispensing, of God&rsquo;s holy nature into our being. The issue of this dispensing is that we are the same in likeness and in nature as the source, the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head3">In His Predestination of the Saints</h2>
<p>The organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, is also an issue of the Father in His predestination of the saints that they may share His life to be His sons (Eph. 1:5). For God to impart His life into us that we may share His life is His dispensing, and this dispensing is an issuing. Verses 4 and 5 of Ephesians 1 are a part of one long sentence: &ldquo;According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; To understand these verses, we must understand their grammatical construction. The subject of these verses is &ldquo;He&rdquo; and the predicate is &ldquo;chose.&rdquo; Verse 5 begins with &ldquo;predestinating.&rdquo; God the Father chose us, predestinating us. Verse 5 is a participial phrase which functions as an adverb that modifies the verb &ldquo;chose.&rdquo; How did He choose us? He chose us by predestinating us. In the past we mistakenly said that God first chose us, and then He predestinated us. If this were true verses 4 and 5 would say, &ldquo;He chose us...<em>and</em> predestinated us.&rdquo; If the grammatical construction were like this, then it would be clear that God did two things in Christ before the foundation of the world: first He chose us and then He predestinated us. But according to the actual grammatical construction, God chose us by the marvelous way of predestinating us, or marking us out. He predestinated us unto sonship. &ldquo;Unto&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;for.&rdquo; God predestinated us for sonship, for making us sons. He desired that we would be His sons by sharing His life. Years ago we coined a new English word&mdash;&ldquo;sonized.&rdquo; Sonship is sonization.</p>
<p>A son is made by the impartation of life which eventually results in a birth. God Himself begot us, regenerated us (John 1:12-13). Because we have been begotten of God, we have received His life and have become His sons. We also have His very holy nature, and this nature will make us holy. God chose us with the intent that we would be born of Him to share His life and to participate in His holy nature. By partaking of His nature, we can be transformed into His image to bear His likeness. Then we will be like God (1 John 3:2). This is the issue of the Father&rsquo;s dispensing, the issue of the Father&rsquo;s impartation of Himself with His life and with His nature into our being.</p><h2 class="head2">An Issue of the Son<br />
as the Course of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<h2 class="head3">In His Redemption of the Father&rsquo;s<br />
Chosen and Predestinated Ones</h2>
<p>The organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, is the issue of the Son as the course of the divine Trinity in His redemption of the Father&rsquo;s chosen and predestinated ones that they may be recovered and brought back to the headship of Christ for the eternal economy of God (Eph. 1:7-10). Man was created by God, but he fell away from God, that is, he fell away from the headship of Christ. In Christ&rsquo;s redemption, fallen mankind gets recovered and brought back to the headship of Christ for the eternal dispensation of God. The word &ldquo;dispensation&rdquo; in Greek is <em>oikonomia,</em> which is the anglicized word <em>economy.</em> In the New Testament, <em>oikonomia</em> means a kind of household arrangement, a plan. God made an arrangement in eternity past that all the things created by Him would be headed up in Christ.</p>
<p>Today we cannot see the entire universe headed up in Christ. The nations of this earth are not united, but they are in a state of division and confusion. God gave the resurrected Christ to be the Head of all things in the heavens and on the earth. God&rsquo;s plan is to bring all His created things into oneness under the headship of Christ. Today there is a spiritual warfare that is going on in the heavens. While I am speaking, I look to the Lord to cover me and shield me from the attack of His enemy. Spiritual warfare is going on in this universe between God and His enemy, Satan. On this earth division and confusion prevail. Christ died on the cross to redeem us back from a place of confusion, recovering us back to the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:7-10 says: &ldquo;In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace, which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; These verses combine redemption with dispensation. Redemption is unto a dispensation to head up all things in Christ. Christ&rsquo;s redemption of us is for the heading up of all things in Christ. As God&rsquo;s redeemed ones, we take the lead among God&rsquo;s creation to be headed up in Christ. We are redeemed, and we are under the headship of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">In His Making of His Redeemed Ones<br />
an Inheritance of God</h2>
<p>The organism of the Triune God is an issue of the Son as the course of the divine Trinity in His making of His redeemed ones an inheritance of God for God&rsquo;s satisfaction (Eph. 1:11). Christ&rsquo;s redemption not only recovers us back to His headship but also makes us God&rsquo;s inheritance for God&rsquo;s enjoyment. Christ&rsquo;s redemption is all-inclusive. On the one hand, His all-inclusive death is the redeeming death, the death that redeemed us back to God and back to the headship of Christ. On the other hand, His death is also the life-releasing death, the death for His multiplication. In the Gospel of John, Christ in His death is likened to three things. John 1 refers to Him as the Lamb of God (v. 29). He died on the cross as the Lamb of God for our redemption, for the forgiveness of our offenses. In John 3 Christ is likened to the serpent that Moses lifted up in the wilderness (v. 14). Christ died on the cross as the brass serpent (Num. 21:4-9) to judge and to destroy the source of sin and the authority of death, the Devil, Satan. In John 12 Christ was likened to a grain of wheat falling into the earth to die (v. 24). This grain of wheat is for the bringing forth of many grains, that is, for multiplication. This is the multiplying death of Christ to release His divine life and to impart His divine life into us in resurrection to make us the many grains.</p>
<p>After He imparted His divine life into us through His death plus His resurrection, He made us an inheritance to God. Now God has a particular possession in the universe. The entire universe is God&rsquo;s possession, but we are now His particular possession. We were created by Him and we were His possession, but we were not His particular possession because He had not yet imparted Himself into our being. In Christ&rsquo;s redemption God has been imparted into us, the Christ-redeemed ones, making us a particular possession for God. In Christ&rsquo;s redemption we can see the issue of the impartation, the dispensing, of the Triune God. The Triune God in the Son has been dispensed, imparted, into our being, making us an inheritance of God for God to be satisfied.</p><h2 class="head2">An Issue of the Spirit as the Consummation<br />
of the Flow of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the consummation of the flow of the divine Trinity. The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow. There is such a divine flow in this universe, and this flow has been consummated, or completed, by the flowing Spirit. This flow issues in the organism of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Seal Christ&rsquo;s Redeemed Ones<br />
with the Essence and Likeness of the Triune God</h2>
<p>The Spirit seals Christ&rsquo;s redeemed ones with the essence and likeness of the Triune God, making them a particular possession of the processed Triune God (Eph. 1:13). The sealing Spirit is the consummation of the divine flow. When a seal is placed on a sheet of paper, the ink essence in the form, the likeness, of the seal is applied to the paper and saturates it. Thus, the ink, the form of the seal, and the paper are mingled as one item. We were like a blank piece of paper before we received the Lord. But when we called on the Lord Jesus, we were sealed with the Holy Spirit. This sealing continues until we are fully redeemed in our body (Eph. 4:30). As we continue to call on the Lord, we continue to be sealed by the indwelling Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God. He seals us with the essence of the processed Triune God, the One who has passed through the processes of incarnation, death on the cross, and resurrection. The Triune God becomes the very ink with which we are being sealed. Now upon us, the blank paper, are the ink and the form of the seal. We are mingled with the Triune God as the sealing Spirit, and this causes us to bear His likeness. This is the dispensing, the impartation, of the Triune God into our being issuing in the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Be a Pledge of God to the Sealed Ones</h2>
<p>After sealing us, this seal becomes a pledge of God to the sealed ones, guaranteeing that God is their inheritance for their satisfaction (Eph. 1:14). On the one hand, we were made God&rsquo;s inheritance for God&rsquo;s enjoyment (1:11, 18). On the other hand, we were made to inherit God as our inheritance for our enjoyment. In Christ we were made an inheritance of God, and under the sealing of the Spirit, we enjoy God as the pledge of our inheritance. The church as the organism of the Triune God is the issue of the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Accomplished by the Transmission<br />
of the Great Power of God</h2>
<p>The dispensing of the divine Trinity to produce the organism of the Triune God is accomplished by the transmission of the great power of God (Eph. 1:19-23). This power raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him in the heavenlies, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things (vv. 19-22). This power that has accomplished so much is transmitted to the church. The transmission of this great, divine power to the church makes it the Body of Christ, an organism of the Triune God (vv. 22-23). Christ is Head over all things &ldquo;to the church.&rdquo; &ldquo;To the church&rdquo; implies a kind of transmission. Whatever God has wrought in and upon Christ is transmitted to the church to make the church the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ. The organism of the Triune God is an issue of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. The church is the issue of the operating Triune God, and this issue becomes the organism of the invisible Triune God. The church is altogether organic, altogether of life. This life is the divine life signified by the tree of life. We are partaking of this tree of life, enjoying this divine life, so that we can be the very Body of Christ expressed in different localities as local churches. The local churches as the expression of the one Body of Christ should have nothing to do with organization but should be totally organic. We need to see that the church, which is the Body of Christ, is absolutely organic.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">IN THE ORGANIC UNION<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 6:8a, 6; Eph. 2:5-6a; 4:4; John 4:24a; 1 John 5:6b; John 16:13; Eph. 2:18; Phil. 1:19; Matt. 28:19b; Rom. 8:2; 2 Cor. 3:6b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 1:4b; 4:5b; 5:6b</h1>
<p>The title of this small book is <em>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity.</em> The organism of the Triune God is the Body of Christ. The organism is of a divine person&mdash;the Triune God. This organism is in the organic union of the divine Trinity. The divine Trinity, strictly speaking, does not refer to the person but to something of the person. The divine Trinity is of the Triune God. The organism refers to a corporate person, the Body of Christ. But the organic union refers to something of the divine Trinity. The divine Trinity and the organic union are two matters that are abstract, mysterious, wonderful, profound, excellent, and therefore, difficult to understand. The organic union is a union of life, by life, and with life. In the divine Trinity, there is such an organic union.</p>
<p>The very salvation which we have received and which is being experienced by us day by day is in the organic union of the divine Trinity. We may also say that our salvation is in Jesus Christ. But where is Jesus? Some may think that Jesus is far away from them. But Romans 10 tells us that He is near us, even in our mouth (v. 8). The unbelievers need to realize that the Savior, Jesus, is in our mouth just like the air. The air that we breathe is always in our mouth. How can we breathe the Lord in? By calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When we heard the gospel, repented of our sins, and believed in the Lord Jesus, we called upon His name. When we called &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; something happened within us. We received the Lord as our peace, joy, rest, and light. If we try to call on other names, nothing happens within us. If we call &ldquo;O George Washington,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Plato, save me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;O Confucius,&rdquo; nothing will happen within us. There is only one name that we can call upon with a guarantee that something will happen within us. We need to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; When we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, we have a sweet feeling within us because something transpires within us. Any other name in the universe that we call upon will not give us such an inward feeling. Whenever we mention the name of Jesus, we have an inner feeling of sweetness. His name is a dear name, a sweet name, a precious name, an excellent name, an uplifting name, a comforting name, an enlightening name, a life-giving name, and a saving name. We can use many wonderful adjectives to describe the name of Jesus. In this name is the organic union. When we call upon the name of Jesus, an organic union transpires within us. We are organically united to the Lord, and He is organically united to us. There is a union in life, an organic union, between us and the Lord. We may not have been aware that we had such an inward organic union with Him. Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were just ourselves apart from the Lord. When we were saved, however, something wonderful transpired within us.</p>
<p>I can still remember the day that I received the Lord in my hometown in mainland China. I was born into Christianity, and I attended denominational meetings for many years without being saved. When I was nineteen years old, a young lady came to our city to preach the gospel. I went to hear her preach one afternoon, and while I was listening to her speaking, I was caught by the Lord Jesus. I believed in the Lord, but no one taught me how to call on the name of the Lord. While I was walking back home from the meeting, I stopped on the street, looked up at the heavens, and prayed. I told the Lord that I loved Him. I told Him that even if the whole world could be given to me, I did not want it; I just wanted Him. After that prayer, I had the deep sensation that Someone was always with me. Another One is with us regenerated Christians. We have an organic union with Him.</p>
<p>As a young man, I was fond of playing soccer. After I was saved, I continued to play soccer. On one occasion I attempted to kick the soccer ball, and I could not do it. Then I went back home, and that was the end of my soccer playing. Why did I quit playing? It was because of my inward organic union with the Lord Jesus. We are united with the Lord Jesus organically. This organic union is accomplished and transpires within us when we believe in our hearts and when we call on His name with our mouths (Rom. 10:9).</p><h2 class="head1">IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>The organic union which is of the divine Trinity is in Christ. Outside of Christ there is no organic union. When we were saved, we believed into Christ. When we entered into Christ, we became identified with Him. Whenever we eat something, what we eat becomes identified with us, and we become identified with it. If I eat some chicken, the chicken gets inside of me and it becomes me. I become identified with the chicken that I eat. Dietitians tell us that we are what we eat. We become what we eat, and what we eat becomes us. According to the Greek language, to believe in the Lord is actually to believe <em>into</em> Him. When we believed into the Lord Jesus, we became identified with Him, and in this sense we became Him. In Christ&rsquo;s death, He identified the redeemed ones with Himself (Rom. 6:8a). According to this truth, to say that we are one with Jesus is not as accurate as saying that we became Jesus. The all-inclusive death of Christ includes us. We died with Him.</p>
<p>According to Romans 6:6, our old man has been crucified with Christ. Christ terminated us when He was crucified. To be crucified means to be terminated, to be ended. When we believed into the Lord Jesus, we became identified with Him and we were terminated. Our history was ended. To believe into the Lord Jesus is not only to be included in Him but also to be ended in Him. Our believing into Him was a kind of suicide for us. When I believed into the Lord Jesus, I was terminated, and my past history came to an end. The formula for our organic union was that we believed into Christ and were included in Him. In this including we were terminated, and this was a preparation for us to enjoy the organic union.</p>
<p>The organic union of the divine Trinity is firstly in the death of Christ and then in His resurrection. On the third day after His death, Christ was raised from among the dead (1 Cor. 15:4). We were also included in His resurrection. In His death we were terminated, and in His resurrection we were enlivened (Eph. 2:5). For Jesus to be crucified and enlivened took about three days. For us who believed into Him, to be crucified and enlivened was instantaneous. At the very second that we called &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we were crucified and enlivened. By calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; our former history ended because our old history was terminated and buried in the tomb, and a new history began. Our old life was ended, and we were living a new life.</p>
<p>In the sixties, some hippies were saved among us and we saw a great change take place in them because of their organic union with the Lord. Calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; terminated their former history, the history of a hippie, and began another history, the history of a saved person. As persons who had believed into Christ, they were persons in Christ, identified with Christ, which means that they became Christ. This is what happens when the organic union transpires within a person. Although this organic union is invisible, it is a wonderful reality. Because we were identified with Christ in His resurrection, we were both enlivened and raised up (Eph. 2:5-6a).</p>
<p>This organic union is not only in Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection but also in His ascension. In His ascension He seated us together with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6b). We need to have the realization that we are now in the heavenlies. We are in the heavenlies because we are in Christ, who is in the heavenlies. Christ is our &ldquo;aircraft.&rdquo; If I am in the aircraft and the aircraft is in the air, then I am in the air.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2 tells us that we have been saved by grace (v. 8). Many Christians think that this merely means that we were not saved by our work but by His redemption, His grace. Actually, to be saved by grace is to be saved by His death, by His resurrection, and by His ascension. Many Christians are expecting to go to heaven, but they do not realize that they were in the heavenlies already. At the very moment we believed into the Lord Jesus and called upon His name, we were in the heavenlies. This is because we became identified with Him by believing into Him. We are still persons living and moving on this earth, but many times we have the deep sensation that we are in the heavenlies. At those times the earthly things cannot touch us because we are transcendent. We are far above all. The other members of our family may be bothered by certain things, but we are soaring above them. We are transcendent because we are people in the heavenlies in the organic union in Christ through His death, resurrection, and ascension.</p><h2 class="head1">IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our organic union with the Lord is also in the Spirit. Christ and the Spirit are not two separate persons. They are one person. This is a divine mystery that is beyond human understanding. Christ is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). The One who died on the cross, resurrected from the dead, and ascended to the heavens is Christ. But this Christ enters into us as the Spirit. When we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the Spirit gets into us. When we call the name of a person, we get the person of that name. If I call a brother&rsquo;s name, that brother will respond to me. The name and the person are one. When we call on the name of Jesus, we get His person&mdash;the Spirit. When we believed into the Lord Jesus, we did not call on the Spirit. We called on the Lord Jesus and we received Him as the Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; The name of the last Adam is Jesus. We called on the objective name of Jesus, and the subjective Spirit came into us. This is because the last Adam in His resurrection was transfigured into the Spirit, that is, He became the Spirit. The Spirit and Jesus Christ are one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE SPIRIT<br />
BEING THE REALITY OF THE ONE BODY</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:4 says that there is one Body and one Spirit. The Body is the organism, and the Spirit is the reality of the organism. There is one organism and one reality. If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have the organism. As long as the Spirit is with us, we have the organism.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Very Essence of the Triune God</h2>
<p>The Spirit, who is the reality of the organism of the Triune God, is the very essence of the Triune God. John 4:24 says that God is Spirit. We may say that the essence of a certain table is wood. The Triune God also has His essence. A certain table is wood, and the Triune God is Spirit. The Spirit is His essence.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Very Reality of God</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also the very reality of God (1 John 5:6b; John 16:13). If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have God in reality. We may have God only in terminology and not as reality. The reality of God is the Spirit. When we called on the name of Jesus, God Himself came into us as the Spirit. Now God is in us. God dwells in us, and we dwell in Him because we have the Spirit who is the reality of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Reaching of the Triune God to Man</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the reaching of the Triune God to man (Eph. 2:18). Seemingly, God is far away from us in the third heavens. How could He reach us? He reaches us not as the Father or as the Son, but as the Spirit. Every Christian has experienced God reaching him as the Spirit. The Spirit is the realization of the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Father. In other words, the Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit. If we have the Spirit, we have the Son and the Father. When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit entered into us. The Spirit within us is the Triune God because the Spirit is the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Processed and Compound Spirit</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also the processed and compound Spirit (Phil. 1:19). Because the Spirit has been processed, He is a compound Spirit. The Spirit has passed through the process of God&rsquo;s incarnation. When God became a man, He picked up humanity. In eternity past He was only God without humanity. But in His incarnation, humanity was added to divinity. Incarnation was a process for God to add humanity to Himself. Then God with humanity went to the cross and died. His all-inclusive death was also a wonderful process. God passed through death in humanity, in the flesh, in man. In the shell of a human body, He went through His all-inclusive death, and He was raised up in resurrection. He went into death, walked through death, and came out of death. Death could not hold Him because He is the resurrection. He raised Himself up from among the dead and entered into resurrection. He is now a God of divinity, of humanity, of incarnation, of an all-inclusive death, and of a wonderful, excellent, transcendent resurrection. The name of our God is Jesus Christ, and when we called upon Him, the Spirit as the processed God came into us. The Spirit is the processed God and the compound Spirit that has been compounded with divinity, humanity, incarnation, death, and resurrection.</p>
<p>When someone cooks a feast, the food of the feast passes through many processes. The food may be salted, other spices may be added to it, and then it is cooked. There is a great difference between a cooked fish and a raw fish. A cooked fish is a processed fish that is good for eating. The very Spirit whom we have received is the processed Spirit, not the raw Spirit. He is the cooked Spirit, the cooked God. Because the Spirit has been cooked, processed, He is edible, refreshing, and nourishing. The processed Spirit of God has come into us as a rich feast for our enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head2">The Consummation of the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also the consummation of the processed Triune God (Matt. 28:19b). God&rsquo;s Trinity was perfect, but it needed to be consummated. The divine Trinity was consummated through His incarnation, death, and resurrection. In resurrection, the divine Trinity was consummated in the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit is the consummation of the divine Trinity. In other words, the processed Spirit is the consummated Triune God. A raw fish is not consummated, but a cooked fish is consummated; it is ready to eat. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection in Matthew 28, He told the disciples to go to the nations and baptize them into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. Such a divine title had never been mentioned until this time because the Trinity of the Godhead had not been consummated. The Trinity was not consummated until the Triune God had passed through the processes of incarnation, death, and resurrection. The divine Trinity has been consummated in the processed Spirit, so the processed Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit of Life and the Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>We may also say that the consummated Spirit is the consummated God as the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Without the Spirit, we cannot be organic. Anything that is organic, that is of life, is of the Spirit. The Spirit is the Spirit of life. He is also the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6b; 1 Cor. 15:45b). The Spirit is life, so He imparts life into us. When He comes into us, life comes with Him and is imparted into us by Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Sevenfold Intensified Spirit</h2>
<p>For the organism of the Triune God, the Spirit is also the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 1:4b; 4:5b; 5:6b). Some people have three-way lamps in their home. The third level of light is the most intense. The Spirit is like a seven-way lamp, shining in an intensified way. The book of Revelation reveals that the one Spirit of God is now sevenfold intensified. We are enjoying this sevenfold intensified Spirit in our organic union with Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">IN THE ORGANIC UNION<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:6b; Rom. 8:11; Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:23; Rom. 15:16b; 2 Cor. 3:18b; 1 Cor. 12:13; Eph. 4:15-16</h1>
<p>In chapter two we saw that the organic union of the divine Trinity is in the Spirit as the reality of Christ. We also saw the Spirit in eight aspects. He is the very essence of the Triune God, the very reality of God, the reaching of the Triune God to man, the processed and compound Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God, the Spirit of life, the life-giving Spirit, and the sevenfold intensified Spirit. In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning the organic union of the divine Trinity in the work of the Spirit and concerning the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIC UNION OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
IN THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">With All That the Triune God Is,<br />
Has Passed Through, and<br />
Has Accomplished, Obtained, and Attained</h2>
<p>The Spirit works over us, in us, and through us. When the Spirit works in us, He works with all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained. The Spirit works in us with the innumerable items of all that the Triune God is. He also works in us with what the Triune God has passed through. The Triune God has passed through incarnation, human living, an all-inclusive death, and resurrection. Now He is in ascension. The Spirit works in us additionally with all of the Triune God&rsquo;s great accomplishments. It was a great accomplishment for the Triune God to become a man, an accomplishment greater than His restoration and further creation of the universe. He did His creating work in only six days by speaking things into being. But to become a man through the divine conception, He had to be conceived in the womb of a virgin and remain there for nine months. What a great accomplishment it was for the infinite God to stay in the womb of a virgin for nine months! The Triune God&rsquo;s incarnation was a much greater accomplishment than His creation of the universe. Now in the universe there is a particular man, a special man, a man with two natures&mdash;the divine nature and the human nature. This man is a God-man. God is in this man, and this man is God. He is God with a human nature and in a human body.</p>
<p>After being born as such a man, He accomplished human living. It was a great matter for our God, the eternal God, to be a man and to live as a man. What a wonder it was for the Lord Jesus to live for thirty years in a poor carpenter&rsquo;s home and to live in the despised town of Nazareth! The infinite, eternal, unlimited God was in that despised town doing the work of a carpenter, fully limited by time and space. He was the holy and infinite God in an unholy environment, being limited in every way.</p>
<p>When I was a young Christian, I wondered why the Lord had to pass through thirty-three and a half years of human living. God created things by speaking them into being, and I wondered why He could not do the same thing to accomplish redemption. The New Testament tells us that He needed to pass through human living to experience its sufferings, trials, and temptations. He needed to be tested so that He could be qualified and capable of being our Savior. God&rsquo;s natural law for us human beings is that we grow to maturity until we are experienced and qualified to do certain things and to bear the responsibilities of adulthood. When God became a man, He passed through this growth process that He had established. Through His incarnation and human living, He was fully qualified, prepared, and equipped to die on the cross, thus accomplishing His all-inclusive death. In His all-inclusive death, He solved and settled all the problems in the entire universe, including the problem of Satan (Heb. 2:14). He brought every negative thing to the cross. The entire old creation was crucified on the cross (Col. 1:20). After His death, He accomplished resurrection. In His resurrection, He accomplished the great task of raising us chosen ones up with Him (Eph. 2:6). First Peter 1:3 says that God the Father regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead. Our being raised up with Him from among the dead was our regeneration. After His resurrection He ascended and sat at the right hand of God, far above all in the universe (Mark 16:19; Eph. 1:20-21). In His ascension He was made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and became the Head over all things and the Head of the church (Eph. 1:22; Col. 1:18). Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments include His creation of the universe and His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</p>
<p>Through His incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension, He obtained and attained something. In His incarnation He obtained a proper man with a proper humanity. One man was obtained by Him in His incarnation, but eventually He obtained a people through His death and resurrection (Heb. 8:10; 1 Pet. 2:9-10). The totality of all His obtaining and attaining is the church in this age and the New Jerusalem in the coming age and for eternity. In the eyes of God, the church and the New Jerusalem have been completed. The working Spirit uses the church and the New Jerusalem to work on us. This matter is all-inclusive, profound, and deep, but we need a vision to see it. The church and the New Jerusalem have already been obtained by God. When the Apostle John talks about the New Jerusalem, the verbs that he uses are in the past tense. Through the processes God has passed through, from His incarnation through His ascension, He has completed the building up of the New Jerusalem. What God has completed is what He has obtained and attained. Now the working Spirit uses what the Triune God has obtained and attained to build us up firstly as the church and then as the New Jerusalem. The Spirit today works with all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained. These are the elements with which the Spirit works on us and in us.</p><h2 class="head2">Regenerating Christ&rsquo;s Redeemed Ones</h2>
<p>The work of the Spirit is firstly to regenerate Christ&rsquo;s redeemed ones (John 3:6b). Our regeneration was instantaneous. After hearing the gospel, we repented, prayed, and called on the Lord&rsquo;s name. While we were praying and calling, we were regenerated by the Spirit in an instant. In this sense, receiving regeneration was easy for us. But the work of the regenerating Spirit is not easy. The Spirit uses Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection and the divine life to regenerate us. Christ&rsquo;s death terminated what we were in the past and released His divine life. His life-imparting resurrection germinated the terminated ones. The death of Christ killed us and the resurrection of Christ enlivened us with the divine life. Christ&rsquo;s death, His resurrection, and the divine life are all needed for the working Spirit to regenerate us.</p>
<p>Without His death, His resurrection, and the divine life, we could not have been regenerated regardless of how much we prayed and called on the Lord. But today we can be regenerated instantly because the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the releasing and imparting of the divine life has been accomplished by Christ. The regenerating Spirit regenerates Christ&rsquo;s redeemed ones with the death, resurrection, and the divine life of Christ. When a person calls &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; he is instantly regenerated by the Holy Spirit with these elements. Regeneration is the very beginning of the organic union of the divine Trinity within us. To be regenerated is to be organically united to the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>To install electricity into a building, there is the need of a long wire to connect the power plant to the building. Many wires are then installed throughout the building to bring the electricity to all the rooms. For the electricity to be applied to the building, the switch must be turned on. The turning on of the switch brings the current of electricity into the building. Christ accomplished everything for us so that we could receive the divine electricity. He installed a long wire from the power plant in the third heavens to us. The preaching of the gospel was the practical installation of the wires within us, in our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. Since all the wires were installed, all that was needed was the turning on of the switch. When we called &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; the switch was turned on and we were united to the divine Trinity. Our regeneration was the beginning of our organic union, our union in life, with the divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Indwelling the Regenerated Saints</h2>
<p>The regenerating Spirit then begins to indwell the regenerated saints (Rom. 8:11). After our regeneration, the regenerating Spirit stays in us, indwells us. Since the time that we called &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we began to sense that Someone is within us all the time. Sometimes this indwelling One is comforting, enlightening, and refreshing, but many times He is very troublesome to us. On the one hand, a husband receives much comfort from his wife. On the other hand, he may be troubled by her. His wife may correct and restrict him in many ways. The husband may like to be free. He may not want to be regulated, limited, or controlled by anyone or anything. In the same way, we believers may feel that we are regulated too much by the indwelling One. The indwelling One is always regulating us. The regenerating Spirit becomes the indwelling Spirit to be the regulating law of life. If He did not indwell us, He could not be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Renewing the Spirit-indwelt Saints</h2>
<p>With the indwelling Spirit, there is the renewing. He renews the Spirit-indwelt saints (Titus 3:5b; Eph. 4:23). The Spirit renews us with a new element. This new element is the Triune God Himself with all that He has passed through, accomplished, obtained, and attained.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sanctifying the Renewed Saints</h2>
<p>The Spirit then continues to sanctify the renewed saints (Rom. 15:16b). The New Testament reveals that sanctification is not only to separate us unto God but also to change our nature with the holy nature of God. Holiness is God&rsquo;s nature. God&rsquo;s holy nature must be worked into our nature to sanctify us. When God&rsquo;s holy nature is worked into our nature, this holy nature will change our human nature. This is dispositional sanctification. God&rsquo;s sanctifying us positionally does not require Him to work His holy nature into us. But for the dispositional, subjective sanctification, there is the need for the divine, holy nature to be wrought into our being, thus changing our nature into God&rsquo;s nature. The Spirit uses the elements of all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained to sanctify us.</p><h2 class="head2">Transforming the Sanctified Saints</h2>
<p>The Spirit also transforms the sanctified saints (2 Cor. 3:18b). Transformation is a metabolic change. It is an inward change caused by a new element replacing the old. The Spirit works Himself into us to be the new element to replace and discharge all of the old things. Then we are transformed into the image of the Lord from one degree of glory to another degree of glory. This transformation is by the Lord Spirit. The Spirit&rsquo;s work is to work the elements of what the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained into our being. He desires to constitute us with these elements, to make these elements our elements for our spiritual and divine constitution. The entire constitution of our spiritual being is a kind of organic union, and this organic union is of the divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The work of the Spirit issues in the baptism of all the believers in the one Spirit into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13a). We were separate individuals, but after being baptized in the one Spirit, we became a corporate Body, the Body of Christ. The issue of the work of the Spirit is also that all the Spirit-baptized believers are drinking of the same one Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13b). We have been put into a position to drink of the Spirit. To be baptized into the Spirit is to get into the Spirit. To drink the Spirit is to get the Spirit into us. We have been outwardly baptized in the Spirit, and we are now inwardly drinking the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING THE LORD IN THE ORGANIC UNION</h2>
<p>Now we need to apply what we have fellowshipped so far. We may love the Lord and love the church. We may like to serve the Lord in the church life. But most of us love the Lord and serve the Lord in the church life in our natural way. We may think that to serve the Lord in the church life, we need to be humble. Then we may pray, &ldquo;Lord, help me and grant me to be humble.&rdquo; But after a period of time, we will not be able to tolerate our situation in the church life. A certain saint was trying to serve the Lord in the church life in a humble way. One day another saint impolitely charged this one to clean the rest room thoroughly. The saint who was trying to be humble got offended. When another saint charges us to do something, we may think something like this: &ldquo;Who are you to charge me and tell me to clean the rest room? Why wouldn&rsquo;t you do it? Are you an elder? You are younger than I am. I am forty-five and you are only twenty-five.&rdquo; Such a reaction is a sign that our service to the Lord in the church life is by our natural life and not in the organic union. If we serve the Lord in the church life by the organic union, we will always realize that we are terminated. In the organic union, it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me (Gal. 2:20). In the organic union, for me to live is Christ (Phil. 1:21). If we serve the Lord in the church life in such an organic union, we will not be offended by anyone.</p>
<p>Let us use another illustration of a brother who loves the Lord and who serves in the church life. Here is a brother who is fifty years old and who has a big heart that can embrace many things. He was also told in an impolite way to clean the rest room thoroughly. At first, he became offended. But then he thought, &ldquo;I am serving the Lord in the church life, and I should not be angry with anyone. I should not be offended, but I should be patient with the one who told me to clean the rest room.&rdquo; As a result, this brother humbled himself to clean the rest room without complaint. Was this service in the organic union? Actually, this kind of service is in the principle of the teaching of Confucius. The Chinese were taught by Confucius to practice self-humility in this manner. Instead of the organic union service in the church life, we may have the Chinese ethics service.</p>
<p>We have to consider the content of our practical church life throughout the years. We have to know the difference between the &ldquo;vinegar&rdquo; of our natural life and the &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; of the divine life in the organic union. Are we serving the Lord in the church life in the organic union, in our American culture, or according to Chinese ethics? Anything other than the organic union will be exhausted sooner or later. Our patience is limited. Only the patience of Christ is unlimited. In Ephesians 3 Paul prays that we may be able to apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth with all the saints (v. 18). The breadth, length, height, and depth are the unlimited dimensions of Christ. His dimensions are unlimited, immeasurable. But we are so limited. Our patience, our love, and our humility are limited and will be exhausted. In the organic union, however, everything is eternal.</p>
<p>The church as the Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God. This organism is not in ourselves but in the organic union of the divine Trinity. Thank the Lord that in His salvation we can experience this organic union which is wrapped up with the Spirit as the person. We always have to be filled and saturated with Him. I mostly pray for two things: the cleansing and covering blood and the anointing Spirit. I need the cleansing and the anointing. This means that I need the working of the Spirit in the organic union.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>When we talk about the building up of the organic Body of Christ, we are referring to the real, practical, and actual building up of a local church. This building must be in the organic way. We must realize that we cannot build up any church outside of the divine life. We must build up the church with the divine life in the organic way. The organic Body of Christ is built up through the growth of the divine life (Eph. 4:15). In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul said that the church was God&rsquo;s farm and that he planted and Apollos watered, but God made to grow (vv. 9, 6). Planting and watering are organic matters. Planting is for growing something, and watering helps the growth. A local church can only be built up by the way of life through the growth in the divine life. It cannot be built up by any other way. We must find a way to nourish and shepherd all the saints that they may grow.</p>
<p>For the building up of the organic Body of Christ, we need to be fitted and knit together (Eph. 4:16a). A carpenter may fit pieces of wood together to build a table, but this table is not organic. Our physical body is fitted and knit together by life. Medical doctors trust in the life of the body when a person is sick. The life of the body takes care of the body. The proper medicine helps this work. The fitting and knitting is by the growth of life. When we stay together in the church life, it is easy for us to experience some friction with others and be offended. It is very difficult not to offend each other in the church life. Our marriage life and our family life are the same. How then can we be fitted and knit together? It is mainly by the growth in life. We need to help the saints grow in life. The more we grow in life, the more we are fitted and knit together.</p>
<p>This building up of the organic Body of Christ is through every joint of the rich supply (Eph. 4:16b). The joints in the Body of Christ are the gifted persons listed in Ephesians 4:11&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. These gifted persons are the channel of the rich supply. They supply every member of the Body. Thus, the building up of the church is through the supply of these joints.</p>
<p>This building up of the Body is also through the operation in measure of each one part (Eph. 4:16c). Each one part refers to all the members. Every member has his own measure. No matter how small or insignificant we may feel, we need to realize that all of us have our measure. Our thinking that we are insignificant is actually false humility. Each of us has a measure, and this measure has to operate, to work. The building up of the Body is not only through the rich supply of the joints, who are the &ldquo;giants,&rdquo; but also through all the small members. The giants are supplying and the small members are operating, working, in measure. This is why we have to endeavor to practice meeting according to the way revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26. To meet according to 1 Corinthians 14:26 gives all the members the chance to practice and to develop their function. Each member of the Body of Christ has to work, has to operate. Thus, the Body is built up through the supply of the giants, or the joints, and also through the working, or the operation, of each member in his own measure.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Body must be built up in the organic way through the growth in the divine life and that we need to be fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. The Body causes the growth of itself through the supplying joints and working parts. At the present time, our building up of the church is very short because many of the members do not operate. They attend the church meetings mainly to listen to others. When we come to a meeting, do we prepare ourselves beforehand to function in that meeting? It may be that most of the time we do not purpose to function. We may only be thinking about who is going to speak in the meeting and what we will hear there. We do not think about our operation as a member of the Body. As a result, the building up of the Body in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not that adequate. We still have not helped the saints to grow in life and to develop their function that they all may operate. Functioning is not only in the meetings but also in taking care of the young ones and shepherding the new ones. Many of the saints merely attend the meetings without functioning organically. We cannot see the entire Body fitted and knit together through the growth in life with the great parts supplying and the small parts operating. Because the growth of the Body is not adequate, the Body cannot build itself up.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16 the Lord said that He would build His church (v. 18). But according to the Epistles, the direct building up of the Body is by all the members. The Head, Christ, prepared and gave the gifted persons as joints to the Body to supply the other members and to perfect them to do the building work. Each member of the Body is then perfected by the gifted ones to build up the Body directly. The Body will eventually be a full-grown man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13b). The fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ; this expression has a stature, and this stature has a measure. When the church is built up to be a full-grown man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, there will be no element of any organization, and we will be no more tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of different teaching (Eph. 4:14).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ORGANIC PROCESSES IN THE SPIRIT<br />
EXPERIENCED BY THE MEMBERS<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; John 3:6b; 1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 1:13; Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 12:13b; Rom. 8:23a; Acts 13:52; 1 John 2:27; Exo. 30:23-25; Rom. 8:14-15</h1>
<p>In chapter three we saw the organic union of the divine Trinity in the work of the Spirit. The Spirit works with all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained. We saw that the totality of what God has obtained and attained is the church in this age and the New Jerusalem in the coming age and for eternity. Everything has been accomplished in the eyes of God. First Peter 1:3 says that we were regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead. When the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead nearly two thousand years ago, we were regenerated. We were regenerated before we were born. By the Triune God&rsquo;s incarnation through His ascension, He has accomplished everything that He intended to accomplish. He has obtained and attained what He desires. Now the consummation of this Triune and processed God, the very consummated, compound Spirit, comes to apply to us what God has already accomplished. This is the work of the Spirit today. In this chapter we want to go on to see the organic processes in the Spirit experienced by the members of the Body of Christ. We are still passing through the processes that are in the organic Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTIZED INTO THE SPIRIT<br />
AS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>The first item of the organic processes in the Spirit is our baptism into the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God (Matt. 28:19). Baptism is a big battlefield in theology. Some practice immersion and others practice sprinkling. Some debate over whether a person should be baptized in hot water, cold water, salt water, fresh water, a lake, a sea, a pool, a river, or a baptistry. Some denominations feel that only baptism in their water is valid. The technique of baptizing people has also been subject to debate. Others have argued over the name into which a person should be baptized&mdash;the name of the Lord Jesus or the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>To understand the truth concerning baptism, we have to take care of all the related verses in the New Testament. The New Testament shows us the truth of both water baptism and Spirit baptism. Matthew 3:11 records John the Baptist saying that he baptized in water and that the Lord, as the One coming after him, would baptize in the Holy Spirit. In the New Testament the Spirit is revealed in two aspects: the aspect of essence and the aspect of economy. The Spirit in this verse is both essential and economical. The essential Spirit is for our life and living. The economical Spirit is for our ministry and work. The Lord puts us into the Spirit so that we can experience the Spirit both essentially and economically.</p>
<p>Our practice of baptizing people must be according to the New Testament. We need to tell the ones whom we are baptizing that we are putting them into the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God. We must exercise our faith to baptize the repentant and believing sinners into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit according to the Lord&rsquo;s charge in Matthew 28:19. The Holy Spirit in Matthew 28:19 is both essential and economical. Because He is listed and ranked with the Son and the Father in this verse, the Spirit is being referred to in His entirety in both aspects.</p>
<p>Before the Triune God was incarnated, He was working among men. But in the Old Testament, God did not have humanity because He had not yet become flesh, and He had not passed through the processes of human living, death, and resurrection. In John 11:25 the Lord told Martha that He was the resurrection and the life. Before He was resurrected, He was already the resurrection. But He did not have the practical experience of entering into resurrection in His humanity. In the Old Testament, He was perfect in His divine virtues and attributes, but He was not complete in the sense that He had not passed through the necessary processes to be consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The Triune God existed before incarnation, but He had not been consummated. For Him to be consummated in order to accomplish His plan, He needed to pick up human nature, pass through the trials, temptations, and tests of human living, go through an all-inclusive death, and enter into the practical experience of resurrection. His incarnation was the beginning of His consummating work until He was fully consummated in His resurrection. In resurrection the Triune God was not only perfect but also consummated. This is why He came back in resurrection to charge His disciples to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. By that time the consummation of the Triune God had been fully accomplished.</p>
<p>We are baptized into the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God. The Triune God is referred to throughout the Bible. Even in Genesis 1:1 the divine Trinity is referred to because the Hebrew word for &ldquo;God&rdquo; is plural in number. But it was not until the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead that the title <em>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit</em> was mentioned. Resurrection was the consummation of all the processes that the Triune God had to go through. In resurrection the Triune God was fully consummated.</p>
<p>At the time of Matthew 28:19, the Triune God had the human nature, and He was qualified with the experience of human living. With Him there was also a wonderful, excellent, lovable death. Death in Adam is terrible. But death with the resurrected Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God is excellent, marvelous, and lovable. At the time He charged the disciples to baptize others into the Triune God, He had also entered into His glorious resurrection. When the Lord Jesus, the embodiment of the Triune God, was telling His disciples to go to disciple the nations, He was in resurrection. As the consummation of the Triune God, He was telling His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We baptize people <em>into</em> the Triune God. &ldquo;Into&rdquo; in Matthew 28:19 indicates a kind of organic union. To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him. We human beings can be put into God. We were once outside of God, but our baptism brought us into God. When we go to baptize people, we go to put them into God. Baptism produces an organic union. We are organically united with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit because we have been baptized into the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God. Praise the Lord for such an excellent, marvelous, wonderful organic union.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; is the one name for the Trinity. The name indicates the person. To baptize people into such a name is to baptize them into the person of the divine Trinity. The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the reaching of God to man. The Trinity reaches us as the Spirit. When the Triune God is in the heavens, He is the Father, the source. When He came to the earth, He was the Son, the course. When He comes into us, He is the Spirit, the reaching One. The Spirit is the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father. What has reached us is the consummated Triune God. Baptism brings us into an organic union with Him. This should strengthen our assurance in the preaching of the gospel. After we preach the gospel to someone and they receive the Lord through prayer and calling on His name, we should immediately put them into the very person of the Triune God.</p>
<p>We have seen that God was incarnated to be a man and that this God-man walked on this earth, living a human life for over thirty years. He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death. Then He came out of death and entered into resurrection. He put all of His believers into the consummated God. When and where did He do this? &ldquo;When&rdquo; is a matter of time, and &ldquo;where&rdquo; is a matter of space. Thoughts of time and space are human. But in the divine thought there is no time or space; everything is eternal. A circle may be used to represent eternity. At a certain place on the circle we may place a cross to signify the crucifixion of Christ. It is difficult to say what events came before the cross and what transpired after the cross. It depends on which direction on the circle that one says is before or after the cross. Revelation 13:8 says that Christ as the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world. According to this verse, the crucifixion was accomplished from the foundation of the world. God&rsquo;s thought is in the eternal realm outside the realm of time and space. God only cares for the fact, not for time and space.</p>
<p>The Scriptures reveal that we were baptized in the Spirit before we were born. The resurrected and ascended Christ as the Head of the church has already baptized all His believing members into the consummated God. He did this in two steps. The first step was on the day of Pentecost, when the Jewish believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5; 2:4). The second step was in the house of Cornelius, when the Gentile believers were baptized in the Spirit (10:44-47; 11:15-17). In these two steps all genuine believers in Christ have been baptized in the Holy Spirit into one Body once for all universally (1 Cor. 12:13). Based upon this, the disciples baptized the new converts not only visibly into water but also invisibly into the Spirit. When the Lord Jesus charged the disciples to baptize the nations into the Triune God, He was referring to both water baptism and Spirit baptism. If we baptize people into water without the Spirit, that is meaningless. Water baptism and Spirit baptism should be absolutely one.</p>
<p>Since the baptism in the Holy Spirit has already been accomplished, some may wonder why we need to practice baptism along with our preaching of the gospel. To be baptized is to accept the fact that has already been accomplished by the doing of the Triune God. The baptizing ones and the baptized ones are saying amen to the fact that the believers have been put into the Triune God. To say amen to this fact is to receive it experientially as one of the bequests of the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head1">REGENERATED BY THE SPIRIT<br />
AS THE REALITY OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</h2>
<p>Another organic process in the Spirit is regeneration. Regeneration is by the Spirit as the reality of the resurrected Christ (John 3:6b; 1 Pet. 1:3). By the resurrected Christ as life we are regenerated. The reality of this resurrected Christ is the regenerating Spirit. Baptism puts us into the consummated Triune God, and regeneration puts the embodiment of the consummated God into us. Baptism puts us into Him, and regeneration puts Him into us. This is a union of life, an organic union. At the time that we believed into Jesus and we were baptized into the consummated God, we got into Him and He got into us. He and we were united together organically.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEALED WITH THE SPIRIT AS THE ESSENCE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Another organic process in the Spirit that we experience is that we are sealed with the Spirit as the essence of God (Eph. 1:13). When we are sealed with the Spirit as a living seal, this seal remains. Furthermore, the sealing of the Spirit in the New Testament is an ongoing process. It is going on continuously to infuse us with the very essence of God as the ink. If I put a seal full of ink on a piece of paper and kept it there for ten minutes, it would saturate through the paper. The ink would be transfused into the paper. The Holy Spirit as the essence of God seals us with Himself as the ink in the same way. The sealing ink of the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing is the essence of God. The Spirit&rsquo;s sealing us is to transfuse all that God is into our being, to saturate our being with the very essence of God. Such sealing makes us divine and brings our inward parts into an organic union with the Triune God. We may say that being baptized into the Spirit, regenerated by the Spirit, and sealed with the Spirit form one group of the organic processes in the Spirit that we experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INDWELT BY THE RESURRECTING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The sealing Spirit is now indwelling us. We are indwelt by the resurrecting Spirit (Rom. 8:11). This means that He remains in us. Now we have the very indwelling presence of the consummated God remaining in our being so that we can enjoy Him. This One now dwells in us to do a wonderful work. The Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us to make our spirit life (8:10b), to make our mind life (8:6b), and to give life to our mortal body (8:11b).</p>
<h2 class="head1">DRINKING OF THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now that we are indwelt by the resurrecting Spirit, we can drink of the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13b). If the Spirit left us after He sealed us, we would not be able to drink Him. But He remains in us as a fountain. We can drink of Him all the time. To drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and have our being saturated with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE SPIRIT AS<br />
THE FIRSTFRUIT OF GOD AS OUR PORTION</h2>
<p>We are also enjoying the Spirit as the firstfruit of God as our portion (Rom. 8:23a). God has allotted Himself to us as our portion. This means that He has given Himself to us as our lot. The indwelling, remaining Spirit is the lot within us today. Now we can enjoy Him. Every believer, to one degree or another, has experienced drinking of the remaining Spirit and enjoying Him. Our favorite foods are very tasty, rich, and satisfying to us. In the same way that we enjoy our favorite foods, we need to enjoy the indwelling God. We drink of Him and we enjoy Him as the firstfruit. The firstfruit means the first taste, and our enjoying of the first taste indicates that the full taste is coming. We are now in the stage of enjoying the firstfruit, which is the fresh Spirit, the fresh consummated Triune God. When the Triune God was consummated, He became the firstfruit to us, and now we are enjoying the fresh consummated God. Many of the Jews will believe in the Lord Jesus when He returns (Zech. 12:10). But by that time the firstfruit will have become the full taste. These Jews will have missed the firstfruit of the Spirit. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we are all tasting the fresh, consummated Triune God today. Our being indwelt by the resurrecting Spirit, drinking of the life-giving Spirit, and enjoying the Spirit as the firstfruit form another group of the organic processes in the Spirit that we experience.</p><h2 class="head1">FILLED WITH THE ESSENTIAL SPIRIT OF GOD</h2>
<p>As we drink of the Spirit and enjoy Him, we will be filled with Him as the essential Spirit of God. Acts 13:52 says, &ldquo;And the disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This infilling of the Holy Spirit is essentially for life, not for power. Joy, being a matter of life, not of power, proves this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANOINTED BY THE ALL-INCLUSIVE COMPOUND SPIRIT AS THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</h2>
<p>The infilling Spirit anoints us as the all-inclusive compound Spirit, who is the compound ointment (1 John 2:27; Exo. 30:23-25). The compound ointment in Exodus 30 typifies the all-inclusive Spirit. This ointment is composed of oil compounded with four spices&mdash;myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. The olive oil typifies the Spirit of God. Myrrh typifies the precious death of Christ. Cinnamon typifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death. Calamus refers to the precious resurrection of Christ. Although it grows in a marsh, it is able to shoot up into the air, signifying the rising up of the Lord Jesus from the place of death. Cassia was used as a repellent to drive away snakes and insects and signifies the power, the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. This shows that the Triune God in His consummation has been compounded with His death, with the sweetness and effectiveness of His death, with His resurrection, and with the power of His resurrection.</p>
<p>The four kinds of spices are divided into three groups of five hundred shekels each. There are five hundred shekels of myrrh. The two spices listed in the middle, cinnamon and calamus, are two hundred and fifty shekels each. The last spice, cassia, is five hundred shekels. These three units indicate the Triune God. The middle unit of five hundred is split in two, signifying that the Son, the second of the divine Trinity, was split on the cross. It is marvelous that our Triune God is a compounded God as the anointing ointment.</p>
<p>Now the very Spirit of God is a compound Spirit that has become an ointment for anointing. Paint is a kind of ointment, and painting is like anointing. The more that something is coated with paint, the more the essence and element of the paint is applied to it. Likewise, the more that the compound Spirit anoints us, the more that the essence and element of God is painted into our being. When the Spirit as the compound ointment is being painted into us, we are becoming more organically united with the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LED BY THE SPIRIT OF THE DIVINE SONSHIP</h2>
<p>Day by day and hour after hour, we are being led by this Spirit, which is the Spirit of the divine sonship (Rom. 8:14-15). We may like to be led by God and we may also pray, &ldquo;Lord, show me Your leading.&rdquo; But we need to realize that His leading is Himself. While He is anointing us, He as the anointing One is our leading. When Abraham was called by God, God did not tell him where to go (Heb. 11:8). The leading of God to Abraham was God&rsquo;s presence. If Abraham turned a certain way and missed the presence of God, he knew this was the wrong way. Abraham took God&rsquo;s presence as his traveling map, so the presence of God was his leading. Today our leading is the anointing Spirit. Our leading from the Lord must be organic; it must be something in the organic union.</p>
<p>In the past many young people came to me for counsel about marriage. I used to have many rules for the young people to follow in considering who they should marry. Eventually, I lost faith in my regulations. Only God fully knows who is the best wife for a brother and the best husband for a sister. In a matter such as choosing a mate, the young saints need to follow God&rsquo;s leading, which is the anointing. You have to go to the Lord. He is in you as the anointing compound Spirit. Do not consider in your mind who is the best person for you. You must follow the inner anointing. If the anointing is not there when you open to the Lord concerning a certain brother or sister, then that one is not the one you should marry. Only the omniscient God knows who the best spouse is for you. He can lead you to the right person. Once a person is married, he may feel that he made a mistake. But every so-called wrong marriage is a right one. The wife you think is the wrong one is actually the right one in God&rsquo;s feeling. She is the right one to put you on the cross. You have to say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You. I may have made a mistake, but You did the right thing.&rdquo; Even the decisions that we think are wrong were made under the sovereignty of God and will work for our good, our transformation.</p>
<p>The foregoing three items of the organic processes in the Spirit&mdash;being filled with the Spirit, anointed by the Spirit, and led by the Spirit&mdash;may be considered as a group. In the organic union, we have the infilling of the Spirit within us. This infilling Spirit becomes the anointing Spirit, anointing us all the time. This anointing becomes our leading, and we are led by the Spirit of the divine sonship.</p>
<p>All the items we have talked about in this chapter show that the Christian life and the church life are absolutely in the organic union. Everything done in the church must be in the organic union. In Acts 13 Barnabas and Paul were sent for the preaching of the gospel and the establishing of the local churches. But they were not sent in an organizational way. Five prophets and teachers were praying and fasting. To pray and fast before God is to get into the practical organic union. In that organic union, Paul and Barnabas were sent. They were sent organically, not organizationally. The organizational way has no life and no Spirit. The organic way is full of life and full of the Spirit. Even if we come to clean the hall, we must clean it organically in the organic union. This means that we have a living contact with the living God in the organic union of the living Spirit. To be an elder, a brother must be in the organic union. To be a deacon, a brother must be in the organic union. To speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, a brother must be in the organic union. The whole church is an organism in the organic union of the divine Trinity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ORGANIC PROCESSES IN THE SPIRIT<br />
EXPERIENCED BY THE MEMBERS<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 5:25a; Rom. 8:2a; Gal. 5:16a, 25b; Rom. 8:4b; Eph. 3:16-17a; Phil. 1:19; Titus 3:5b; Rom. 15:16; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rev. 4:5; 5:6; 2 Cor. 13:14; 1 Cor. 6:17; Rev. 22:17a</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw nine of the organic processes in the Spirit experienced by the members of the Body of Christ. In this chapter we want to see ten more of these organic processes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING BY THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The last item that we saw in the previous chapter was that we need to be led by the Spirit of the divine sonship (Rom. 8:14-15). When we are under the leading of the indwelling Spirit, we will live a life that is the life of a son of God. We should not live a life of a son of Adam. We have to live a life according to the leading of the Spirit of the divine sonship. Then we are living by the Spirit of life (Gal. 5:25a; Rom. 8:2a). To live by the Spirit of life means to live by taking Him as our person. Paul said that he had been crucified with Christ and that it was no longer he who lived but Christ lived in him (Gal. 2:20). Paul realized that he had been terminated and that Christ, realized as the Spirit, was living in him. We have to ask ourselves who is living. Are we living or is He living?</p>
<p>Many Christians are still under the direction of human ethics. Human beings should be ethical, but we Christians should not be under the direction of human ethics. We have Someone much higher than ethics directing us. This higher One is the consummated Triune God. This One as the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, indwelling Spirit is our person. We need to allow Him to live Himself through us. When a husband loves his wife, is he loving or is the consummated Triune God loving? Regardless of how good something is that we do, if the consummated Triune God is not doing it through us, it is not acceptable to Him. God does not want human ethics. He wants to live through us. He wants us to live Him. We need to give the Lord a way to do everything through us. According to Paul, &ldquo;it is no longer I who live&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). Because we have been crucified with Christ, we are terminated, finished. When I speak, it should be no longer I but Christ who speaks. We have to live a life that is not of ourselves but a life of taking Him as our person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING BY THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We also need to walk by the mingled spirit (Gal. 5:16a, 25b; Rom. 8:4b). We may say that living by the Spirit and walking by the Spirit are the same. But there is still a little difference between living and walking. To live by the Spirit is general, whereas to walk by the Spirit is more particular and practical. Galatians 5:16 and 25 plus Romans 8:4 use the word &ldquo;walk,&rdquo; but Greek has two words for <em>walk.</em> Galatians 5:16 and Romans 8:4 use a general word for walk, whereas Galatians 5:25 uses a particular word that means to march in military rank by keeping step, that is, to walk in regulation. Romans 8:4 says that we should not walk according to flesh but according to spirit. The spirit here and in Galatians 5:16 and 25 refers to the mingled spirit. We have to walk according to our spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.</p>
<p>I have confessed many times that I did not walk according to spirit. I may have said something good to my wife, but it was a good word that was not according to spirit. It may have been a word only according to my mind or emotion. Although we may not admit it, we mostly care for ethics, for what is right and what is wrong. We do not have a thorough care for our spirit. We may speak a good word, but do we speak it according to our spirit or according to our mind or emotion? What we speak may seem spiritual, heavenly, and divine, but as long as we do not speak it according to our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit, our mingled spirit, we are condemned in the eyes of God. We may be highly appraised by others, but we are condemned by our spirit with its conscience. Our spirit justifies only what is done according to it.</p>
<p>After reading this fellowship, we may wonder who is able to walk according to spirit. We have to be able. We need to apply Paul&rsquo;s word in Philippians 4:13&mdash;&ldquo;I can do all things in Him who empowers me.&rdquo; We can do everything in the One, Christ, who strengthens and empowers us, and this One is in our spirit. If we speak something in our mind, this One will not strengthen us. Sometimes as I was about to speak a good word to someone, the dear One within me pulled me back, not allowing me to speak what I wanted to speak. We all have to learn to walk according to our mingled spirit. This is the real practice of the organic union. The organic union includes us and the divine Trinity. Therefore, we must live in Him and by Him as a divine person. We must also live with Him as the Regulator. We should not be regulated by what is good or bad but by the indwelling Spirit mingled with our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">STRENGTHENED BY THE SPIRIT INTO THE INNER MAN<br />
THAT CHRIST MAY MAKE HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>If we are living by the Spirit of life and walking by the mingled spirit, we will be strengthened by the Spirit into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts (Eph. 3:16-17a). We need to be strengthened into our regenerated spirit, which is our inner man. When we live by ourselves, we are very strong in our mind. We may say that we do not have any time to pray, but we have much time to talk on the telephone. The telephone is very sticky to many of us, especially the sisters. Once they get on the phone, it is hard for them to get off. We like to talk much and we pray so little because we are too strong in our mind and emotions. But we need to be strong in our inner man, strong in our spirit. When we are strong in our spirit, we like to pray, and we will pray. We pray because we are strengthened into our inner man. Often we are outside of the inner man. We have to get back to the inner man, but we cannot make it by ourselves. This is why Paul prayed for us.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 3 was not only for the Ephesians but also for all the saints throughout all the generations, including you and me. If we had the attitude that the Epistles were written only to those to whom they were addressed, then none of the Epistles would be for us. This would mean that the Bible is not for us. This reasoning is illogical. Paul&rsquo;s first Epistle to the Corinthians is addressed not only to the church in Corinth but also to all the believers in every place who call upon the name of the Lord (1 Cor. 1:2). Since we are calling on the name of the Lord, 1 Corinthians was written to us. Furthermore, Paul charged the Colossians to cause his letter to them to be read by the Laodiceans, and he also told the Colossians to read the letter that he had written to the Laodiceans (Col. 4:16). It is clear that any book written in the New Testament was written to all the saints through all the generations. Thank the Lord that Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 3 is for us. To take this prayer is to receive a great blessing. The Apostle Paul prayed for us. He bowed his knees to the Father that the Father would grant us to be strengthened into the inner man that Christ might make His home in our hearts. For the Father to grant us this request is His giving us mercy. The Father strengthens us through a channel, the Spirit. Actually, the consummated Spirit does the work of strengthening us.</p>
<p>In some of the church or conference meetings we may have been very excited. But later we may become weak, down, and disappointed. We may be like a flat tire. When we are weak, down, or disappointed, suddenly something begins to strengthen us. This strengthening One is the consummated Spirit. He strengthens us because the Father is still answering Paul&rsquo;s prayer. When we are being inwardly strengthened we need to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Now my Father is answering my brother&rsquo;s, the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s, prayer for me.&rdquo; When you are disappointed and you are suddenly strengthened from within, do you think this is an accident? It is not an accident. It is the answer of the Father to the Apostle Paul. He is answering Paul by granting you, giving you mercy, to be strengthened through His Spirit, the consummated Spirit, into the inner man. When we are like a flat tire, He comes in to pump us up, to strengthen us. We may be like a flat tire one minute, but the next minute we may be strong. One minute ago we may have been weeping, but the next minute we may be saying, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Hallelujah, Christ is Victor!&rdquo; We Christians fluctuate frequently. Our weeping may turn to laughter and our sighing into praising. This is because the Father is answering the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 3.</p>
<p>Being strengthened into our inner man is with a purpose&mdash;that Christ may make His home in our hearts. The heart is like a house with four big rooms&mdash;the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience. Christ wants to settle down in all of these rooms, to make His home in our hearts. To make His home in our hearts is to take us over. When I was a young believer, I remember declaring and feeling that I fully belonged to Jesus and that He fully belonged to me. But when I look back to when I was young, I can realize that Jesus did not have the way to take me over. Many of the young people among us love the Lord and belong to Him, but actually Jesus does not have the way to take them over, to possess them, and to occupy them. When a person buys a house, he takes it over. This means that he possesses the house, moves in, and occupies every room. Does Christ have the full way to occupy your mind, your emotion, your will, and your conscience? You may tell the Lord that you love Him and belong to Him, but does He have the way to take your whole being over, to possess every part of your inner being, to occupy every room of your heart? Does He have the full freedom and way to move into the room of your mind, the room of your emotion, the room of your will, and the room of your conscience? The Lord knows. Christ desires to occupy us not in a general way but in a particular way. He wants to occupy every room of our inner house. When He makes His home in our hearts, we will be able to apprehend His dimensions and know His knowledge-surpassing love that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (3:18-19).</p><h2 class="head1">SUPPLIED BY THE BOUNTIFUL SPIRIT<br />
OF JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>We are also supplied by the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). In Acts 16:7 is the Spirit of Jesus, and in Romans 8:9 is the Spirit of Christ. In Philippians 1:19 is the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The emphasis of &ldquo;the Spirit of Jesus&rdquo; is upon humanity and strength for suffering. But the emphasis of &ldquo;the Spirit of Christ&rdquo; is upon the resurrection and the imparting of life. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the bountiful Spirit that can support us and sustain us to withstand all kinds of sufferings and to live a transcendent life, a resurrected life. When Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he was under the suffering of imprisonment. Imprisonment was a great suffering to Paul, but he said that through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, he could be sustained to live and magnify Christ (vv. 20-21). By this bountiful Spirit, Paul not only was able to withstand the suffering of imprisonment but also was able to live Christ and magnify Christ through life or through death. To magnify Christ is to live a resurrection life, a transcendent life. Imprisonment could not confine this life. Paul could withstand imprisonment and magnify Christ by living Him because he was fully supplied by the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ. By the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we can experience the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ. Then we can live a transcendent life to express Christ in the way of magnification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RENEWED BY THE REGENERATING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Another organic process in the Spirit experienced by us is that we are being renewed by the regenerating Spirit (Titus 3:5b). In our Christian life, we are undergoing a process of renewing. Sometimes we are up and other times we are down. Whether you feel high or low, up or down, strengthened or disappointed and discouraged, you are undergoing a renewing process. I do not encourage you to be disappointed or down, but the Christian life in our experience is always up and down. If you do not know how to weep or laugh, you are not a proper Christian. You may be like a &ldquo;marble Mary&rdquo; in front of some Catholic cathedrals who never weeps or laughs because she is a statue, not a living Christian. We may say that to be down is bad and that to be up is good, but for the renewing we need to be up and down. Of course, it is not good to be down for too long a time. But if you are down, do not worry. After some time, you will be up. When you are down, you are ready to be up. But when you are up, do not rejoice too much. When you are up, you are ready to be down. This process of being up and down is the process of renewing. I have seen some saints who were down for three months or even one year. You may feel that some of the saints&rsquo; conditions are pitiful and hopeless. But do not say this. As long as a person is a Christian, there is hope. A Christian may be down today, but some day he will be up. At the latest, he will be up when the Lord Jesus comes back. The ups and downs are the process of renewing.</p>
<p>We need to realize that it is easier to stand than it is to fall down. It is normal for a person to stand, but there has to be a strong factor to make him fall down. We should not worry about the saints. It is easy for them to stand, but not so easy for them to fall down. This is the good news. The principle set up by God is that we stand (Rom. 14:4). You may fall down, but do not worry because you will be up. When you recall your falling down, you may feel ashamed, but you will have a deeper sensation that you experienced much renewing. This is because the indwelling Spirit falls down with us when we fall down. He also imparts the divine element into our being to renew us for our transformation into the image of Christ (Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SANCTIFIED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>As we are being renewed by the Spirit, we are also being sanctified by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:16). To be sanctified means that some element of God&rsquo;s holy nature has been wrought into our nature. Much of the time God&rsquo;s nature is wrought into us when we feel down. When we feel that we are up, not much of God&rsquo;s holy nature can be wrought into us. When we are feeling down and disappointed, that provides an opportunity for the holy nature to be wrought into our nature to make us holy, that is, to sanctify us. Sanctification is an organic process in the Spirit that we need to experience daily.</p><h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMED BY THE SPIRIT AS<br />
THE LORD IN RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>As long as we are being renewed and sanctified by the Spirit, we are also being transformed by the Spirit as the Lord in resurrection (2 Cor. 3:17-18). Whatever we are according to our first birth is natural. But the part of our being that is transformed is in resurrection. The goal of transformation is to transfer us out of our natural life into the resurrection life. The transfer from the natural life into the resurrection life is transformation. We were born natural, so we need to be regenerated, which means that we need to be generated again. Regeneration may be considered as the beginning of transformation. The renewing and sanctifying of the Spirit are the continuation of the transformation by regeneration. Transformation itself is the consummation of the transfer from the natural life to the resurrection life. This transformation takes place by the Spirit as the Lord. In 2 Corinthians 3:17 the Lord is called the Spirit, and in verse 18 there is a compound holy title&mdash;&ldquo;the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord Spirit is the transforming Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEARCHED BY AND TRANSFUSED WITH<br />
THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We are also being searched by and transfused with the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 4:5; 5:6). In this dark age today, the Spirit has become a sevenfold intensified Spirit. The seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb and the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. Eyes are for searching and transfusing. When we look at others, we search them out. We can tell what their attitude is, what kind of persons they are, and how they feel. Our looking at others is also a kind of transfusing of our inward being into them. The seven Spirits being the seven eyes of the Lamb means that God is searching us and transfusing us with all that He is. This is another organic process in the Spirit experienced by the members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PARTICIPATING IN THE FELLOWSHIP<br />
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
IN THE FLOW OF THE GRACE OF CHRIST<br />
OUT FROM THE LOVE OF GOD</h2>
<p>As the members of the Body of Christ, we are participating in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit in the flow of the grace of Christ out from the love of God. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; &ldquo;With you all&rdquo; indicates our participation. The love of God is the source, the fountain that flows out. The grace of Christ is the course of the love of God. Then the grace of Christ with the love of God reaches us in the fellowship, the communication, of the Spirit for our inward enjoyment and participation. Day after day and all day we should participate in the fellowship, the communication, of the Spirit which is in the flow of the grace of Christ that comes out of the source of the love of God. This participation is our daily enjoyment, and it is an organic process in the Spirit that will change us, renew us, transform us, and perfect us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). This refers to the believers&rsquo; organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (15:4-5). It is a matter not only of life, but in life (the divine life). Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit. Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), who is now in us and is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16).</p><h2 class="head1">AS THE TRANSFORMED, TRIPARTITE MAN<br />
BECOMING ONE COUPLE<br />
WITH THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>As the transformed, tripartite man, we are becoming one couple with the processed Triune God. Revelation 22:17 refers to &ldquo;the Spirit and the bride.&rdquo; This is a couple of God and man. This God is not the &ldquo;raw God&rdquo; but the processed Triune God, and this man is not the natural man but the transformed, tripartite man. Our spirit was transformed by being regenerated, our soul is now being transformed by being renewed, and our body will be transformed by being transfigured at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. At that time all three parts of our being will have been transformed. Thus, we will become a transformed, tripartite man to be God&rsquo;s bride, God&rsquo;s counterpart. God is triune and we are tripartite. The processed Triune God and the transformed, tripartite man are a universal couple that match each other in every way.</p>
<p>The Triune God has been fully processed, and by the time of His coming back, a group of overcoming saints will have been fully transformed. Revelation 19 tells of the marriage feast that these saints enjoy with the processed Triune God (vv. 8-9). Eventually, the Spirit and the bride speak together as a couple. The conclusion of the entire revelation concerning God in the Bible is that He is now the Spirit, the consummated Triune God. From God&rsquo;s creation through His ascension was the period of the process of the Triune God. The consummation of this long process is the consummated Spirit, who is the Spirit. When the Bible says &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; in Revelation 22:17, it is referring to the consummated Triune God who is the Bridegroom. &ldquo;The bride&rdquo; refers to the transformed, tripartite man, who is composed of the perfected, overcoming saints, including both the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers. The bride of the consummated God is the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom. Revelation 21:9 and 10 tell us that the New Jerusalem is the bride, the wife of the Lamb. The bride is mainly for the wedding day, while the wife is for the entire life. The New Jerusalem will be the bride in the millennium and the wife, composed of all God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people, in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The consummated God will be the Husband of the New Jerusalem, the transformed, tripartite man. This is the conclusion of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WITHOUT THE SPIRIT, NO REALITY;<br />
WITHOUT THE SPIRIT, NO BODY OF CHRIST, NO CHURCH</h2>
<p>Without the Spirit, we have no reality. Without the Spirit, we have no Body of Christ, no church. In chapter two we have seen that the Spirit is the reality of the Body of Christ. Hence, if there is no Spirit, there is no Body of Christ, no church. The reality of the Body of Christ is the Spirit whom we have received, experienced, and enjoyed in many aspects, and the church life is the very Spirit in whom we live and according to whom we walk. It is this Spirit that makes the church organic. The organic factor of the church life is altogether the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>As a concluding word to our fellowship in this book, I would like to fellowship my burden in studying all these items concerning the organism of the Triune God in the organic union of His divine Trinity. You need to consider what we would be if we were all active in this organic union. You may love the Lord, but you need to ask yourself&mdash;are you organic, living, active, and capable in preaching the gospel to get sinners saved for the Lord? You may have preached the gospel out of your love for man, but you must confess that you have not been that organic, living, active, and capable. You may have spent much time in the past to bring people to the gospel preaching meetings so that they could be saved, but you were not organically capable to talk to these ones about the gospel. When I preached the gospel to a large gathering, many saints would come to me after the meeting with their unbelieving guests so that I could bring them to the Lord. These saints had a heart for the gospel, but they did not have the capability to talk to people concerning the gospel. In the preaching of the gospel, most of the saints are not that organic, living, active, and capable. If you would receive the fellowship in this book and practice it, I believe that within a short time you will be organic, living, active, and capable in saving sinners. You will be able to have a small gospel preaching meeting with a new one and his family.</p>
<p>I would also like to ask another question&mdash;how many young saints, how many new believers, are under your care? You may be taking care of someone, yet you do not know how to help him because you have not been organic, living, active, and capable. If you would take the grace to get into the fellowship in this book and live according to the organic union for a period of around six months to a year, you will not only have a heart to take care of the young ones, but you will also be organic, living, active, and capable in taking care of them.</p>
<p>The speed of the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is too slow, and the rate of increase is too low. There are not many churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery that have over one thousand saints. If our children were the only ones who were gained for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we would still increase, but our rate of increase has been too low. We may baptize ten people, but it may be that not even two of them would remain. This is because there are no nursing mothers to take care of them. A newborn child needs a nursing mother&rsquo;s care. If we would take the fellowship in this chapter to live an organic life, we will be organic, living, active, and capable in preaching the gospel to save sinners and in taking care of the new ones, the young ones.</p>
<p>You may have a heart to preach the gospel and to take care of new ones, but you may not have the capability because for years your Christian life and church life have not been organic. They may have been too much according to organization and arrangement. If ten new ones are baptized, you may be assigned by the church to care for two of them. You may try your best to take care of them, but eventually you will become disappointed. You may go to visit these new ones, but they will not get helped because you have not been helped yet. Since you have not been helped, how can you help others? This is the real situation because we have not been living our Christian life and church life in an organic way. A pastor of a certain denomination decided to divide the congregation into small groups. These small groups were to come together during the week for fellowship, and certain ones were assigned to be leaders of these small groups. Eventually these small group gatherings had to be stopped because none of the participants knew what to do. Why was this the case? It was because the members had not been perfected to live an organic church life.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11 and 12 say that the gifted ones perfect the saints to do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ. Verse 16 says that the Body will build up itself through the joints of the supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. This means that every member of the Body is operating and working. But how can each one part work without being perfected? The fellowship in this book is to help us to wake up and reconsider our way. Is our way of meeting organic or organizational? Every bit of the church life must be organic, not organizational. Everything organic is in the Spirit and full of life.</p>
<p>If we practice the fellowship in this book, we will be organic, living, active, and capable. Because we have received the help, we will know how to talk about Jesus with the unbelievers and how to take care of the young ones. Because we have been perfected, we will know how to perfect others. Because we have a living and an organic Christian life and church life, we will be capable of helping others in a small group meeting. Furthermore, when the whole church comes together, everyone will have something to say according to the truth revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Whenever we come together, each one will have something. This is different from today&rsquo;s practice of one speaking and the rest listening. We need an organic Christian life plus an organic church life. We must wake up and reconsider our way. Will we be satisfied with our present situation? Should we continue in the same way for another ten years? Surely we should not. Then what shall we do? We must be organic in our Christian life and in our church life.</p></body></html>
