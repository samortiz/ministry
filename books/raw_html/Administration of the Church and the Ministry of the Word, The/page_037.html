 <h2 class="head1">RECEIVING HELP FROM GOD AND NOT FROM MAN</h2>
<p>We should not be indebted to others. We should receive our help from God, not from man. The past one hundred years of Christian work here has not built up the church; instead, it has damaged and torn down the church. The Western missionaries need to learn the lesson of helping people before the Lord without making them their beneficiaries. People should feel that they have received their help from God, not man.</p>
<p>It is not edifying for the Western brothers to give people the feeling of being their beneficiaries. By so doing, they make themselves superior to others. This will never build up the church. The church has been corrupted. When we help in secret, our help will benefit others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT CONSIDERING OTHERS SUPERIOR<br />
AND OURSELVES INFERIOR</h2>
<p>The Western brothers had good intentions, but they needed to consider their way. Their way was inappropriate because it did not edify. Many of the brothers were associated with them for a long time, considering that everything from the West was good and helpful. We never thought that we should help them in this aspect because we considered ourselves to be inferior. We should not think too highly of ourselves, and we should not consider ourselves inferior. We do need the supply from the West in many areas, but this does not mean that everything from the West is correct. This depends on our ability to discern matters.</p>
<p>We have received help from the Western brothers, but they also need to receive help from us. We should be humble and receive help from them, but this does not mean that everything they have is proper. We criticize them because we hope that we can all learn the lesson. When the elders decide to study a particular book of the Bible, they would not insist on another book if they were experienced in spiritual matters and in their behavior. These brothers were competent in their medical field, but in administrating the church and in touching spiritual matters, they were infants learning to speak.</p>
<p>Whether we can supply the need of the church does not depend on which book of the Bible we study. We can supply the spiritual need of the saints through any book. These brothers were not responsible ones in the church, but they gave the saints a negative impression. Before they rendered a supply, they adjusted others; before their capability was manifested, they criticized others. This indicates a lack of learning in spiritual matters and an inability to get along with others. Such a lack damages the building work of the church. Therefore, we need to learn to know people and discern matters.</p>
<p>When we are learning to serve the Lord, we must be able to discern matters. We should not think that everything from the West is good. We have invited Western brothers with great expectations, but the result of their visit causes us to be fearful. On their side, their conduct was inappropriate; on our side, we did not know how to express ourselves. We received many &ldquo;Western meals,&rdquo; but the Western brothers refused to receive &ldquo;Chinese meals.&rdquo; This is pride.</p>
<p>It is necessary to discern matters for the building up of the church. If we always appreciate the things of the West and despise the things of the East, the church will never be built up. The Lord is not only the Lord of the Jews; He is also the Lord of the Gentiles. Likewise, the Lord is the Lord of the Westerners and of the Chinese. He does not give light only to the West. Hence, while we should not be proud, we should not feel inferior. We should study whether a matter is right or wrong and whether it is helpful or not. We should not think that everything from the West is good and therefore should be received. Rather, we should learn to know people and discern matters.</p>
<p>As we are building the Lord&rsquo;s church, we must learn to discern matters. We should not treat anything lightly. We should carefully consider and evaluate the matters that involve us and the saints. We should consider the source of a matter and its consequences before making decisions. We must learn this lesson. Every doctor must carefully consider the medication that should be given to a patient. We cannot be rash and careless or crude and coarse; rather, we must always be careful and cautious. We need to spend time before the Lord to carefully consider how to deal with others. Since we are building up the church, we must learn to discern matters. This applies to the administration of the church, the ministry of the word, and our contact with others.</p>
