   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we considered the first three items of the armor of God: the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The girdle is related to truth, the breastplate is related to righteousness, and the shoes are related to peace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that truth is God expressed in our living as our standard, pattern, and principle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Righteousness is Christ in our enjoyment and experience as the covering of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have truth in our living, we shall certainly have righteousness as our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible reveals that righteousness issues in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is peace both with God and with man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is the very peace Christ accomplished on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, to have the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes is to have truth, righteousness, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we live out God in our daily living, we are covered with Christ as our righteousness, and we have peace as our firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we are prepared to fight against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I. THE SHIELD OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 16 says, With all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need truth to gird our loins, righteousness to cover our conscience, peace as the standing for our feet, and faith to shield our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we live by God as truth, we have righteousness 4:24 , and righteousness issues in peace Heb 12:11; Isa 32:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With all these, we can easily have faith as a shield against the flaming darts of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the Author and Perfecter of such faith Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For us to stand firmly in the battle we need to be equipped with these four items of God s armor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The shield of faith is not something that we put on, but something that we take up in order to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Faith comes after truth, righteousness, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we shall spontaneously have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This faith is a safeguard against the fiery darts, the attacks, of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need now to consider the shield of faith in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We certainly are not to have faith in our own ability, strength, merit, or virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our faith must be in God Mark 11:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is real, living, present, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to have faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We also should have faith in God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every Christian must know both God and the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s heart toward us is always good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No matter what may happen to us or what kind of sufferings we may undergo, we must always believe in the goodness of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has no intention to punish us, to injure us, or to cause us to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Along with faith in God s heart, we should have faith in God s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may change, but God does not change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As James 1:17 says, there is no shadow of turning with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, He cannot lie Titus 1:2 , but is always faithful to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is not only faithful, but also able.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we need to have faith in God s ability.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 3:20 Paul declares that God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Still another aspect of our faith is faith in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is bound to fulfill all that He has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more He speaks, the more responsible He becomes to fulfill His own word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can tell Him, God, You have spoken, and Your written Word is in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Lord, You are bound to fulfill Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hallelujah for God s faithful word!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We also need to have faith in God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because God is a God of purpose, He has a will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His will with respect to us is always positive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, no matter what befalls us, we should care not for our happiness or our environment, but for God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our environment may change, but God s will never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, we must have faith in God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because God is sovereign, God could never make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Under His sovereignty, even our mistakes work for good.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If God did not sovereignly allow us to make mistakes, we could not possibly make them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, this does not mean that we should deliberately make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we are wrong, we need to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But there is no need for us to regret, for that means we are lacking in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After we repent for a mistake or shortcoming, we must still exercise faith in God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We could not have made that mistake if He had not sovereignly allowed us to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, there is no need for regret.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all need to have a full faith in God, in God s heart, in God s faithfulness, in God s ability, in God s word, in God s will, and in God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we have such a faith, Satan s flaming darts will not be able to damage us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The flaming darts are Satan s temptations, proposals, doubts, questions, lies, and attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Flaming darts were used by warriors in the apostle s time, and the apostle used this as an illustration of Satan s attacks on us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Every temptation is a deceit, a false promise.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The flaming darts include the Devil s proposals that come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As we are waking up in the morning, often Satan will make proposals to us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For this reason, we need to get into the Word the first thing in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we are not in the Word, we shall have no covering against the Devil s proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Doubts and questions are also flaming darts of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Have you ever noticed that a question mark looks very much like a serpent?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It was Satan who asked Eve, Hath God said?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Gen 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When the Devil questions us in this way, our response should be to flee, without even talking to him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many times Satan attacks us with lies.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But the shield of faith also guards us against these flaming darts.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Devil s flaming darts come as thoughts injected into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These thoughts may seem to be our own thoughts, but they are actually Satan s. I used to believe that such thoughts were my own.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Later I began to realize that they came from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I discovered this after such thoughts persisted in coming after I had decided not to entertain them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I saw that these thoughts were not mine, but Satan s. Prior to that time, my practice was to confess all these thoughts to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now I refuse to confess them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, some may think that even though these thoughts come from Satan, they are injected into us because we are evil.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do not believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Rather, you should say, Lord, I am fallen, but I am under Your cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Satan, this thought is yours, and you must bear the responsibility for it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I will not share this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Nevertheless, due to an overly sensitive conscience some continually confess things that are caused by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Never confess thoughts injected into you by Satan in his subtlety.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In order to have the faith to be defended against Satan s flaming darts, we need a proper spirit with a conscience void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>However, faith is not mainly in our spirit nor in our conscience, but in our will, the strongest part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The New Testament says that we believe with our heart Rom 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>According to our experience, this faith in our heart is related mainly to the exercise of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>No one with a will like a jellyfish can have strong faith.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In James 1:6 we are told that he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Such a person has a vacillating will.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Hence, if we would have faith, we need to exercise our will.</S>
