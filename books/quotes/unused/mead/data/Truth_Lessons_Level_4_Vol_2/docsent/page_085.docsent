   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This work involves calling, redemption, regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were once the old creation, but God is working on us, making us a new creation.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s other kind of work related to the new heaven and new earth is His work of restoration in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is God s work to restore the unregenerated nations to be the people, the nations, in the new universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through these two kinds of work, God will have two kinds of peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first kind will be the saints, the regenerated and transformed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The second kind will be those who are not regenerated and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will be the restored nations, that is, those who are restored to the original state of God s creation.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is a basic difference between the new creation and the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation possesses the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though the old creation came into being through the mighty work of God, He does not reside in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, the first creation, the old creation, has no divine content.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The divine nature does not dwell in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the old creation has become old.</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These nations will be restored and even redeemed, but they will not be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, in the new heaven and new earth, God will have both the new creation and the restored part of the old creation.</S>

   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This indicates that the dwelling place of God and His redeemed will not be in heaven but on the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, the restored nations, whose rebellious nature will have been completely purged, will become the nations on the new earth, dwelling around the New Jerusalem.</S>
