   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF AUTHORITY I. AUTHORITY AND ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whenever we talk about the administration of the church, we should consider the question of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without authority, there is no administration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whether it is the administration of a group of people or the administration of a place, there is the need for authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you examine the affairs conducted among mankind, you will discover that there is hardly an issue which does not involve authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is quite amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, it should not be amazing, because God has ordained it this way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For instance, a maid may be hired to work for you in your kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even here, there is the question of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On one hand, you give her the authority to manage the kitchen; on the other hand, you also become the authority over her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although she only performs such menial tasks as those pertaining to the kitchen, there is authority above her, and at the same time there is authority in her hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Strictly speaking, the authority in her hand is the same authority over her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If she does not acknowledge the authority over her, she will lose the authority in her hand immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If she does not acknowledge you as her employer, or if she denies your authority over her, immediately she will lose her authority to work in your kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although cooking in a kitchen is a very menial task, authority is involved in it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose two brothers in a meeting hall are responsible for the cleaning of the hall throughout the year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you look into this matter carefully, you will realize that authority is also there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the responsible brothers assigned these brothers to the cleaning work, they were given authority to open and lock the doors in order to manage the cleaning of the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they want to close the doors, you and I have no right to interfere, because they have this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where does this authority come from?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It comes from the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The responsible brothers have given them this authority; at the same time, they also have become their authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they do not accept the authority of the elders, they will at once lose this cleaning authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Once they reject the authority over them, immediately they will lose the authority in their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You can see the matter of authority even in such a work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is true not only in the home and in the church, but everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no way to avoid this consideration of authority, whether in the school, in the office, in the factory, or in any organization.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once authority is removed from human society, it will be impossible to organize people together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a sure principle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Among all of mankind, nothing is more noble than the administration of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, such a noble task can never be carried out without authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If authority is taken away from a church, there will be no way to administrate and manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It will be useless to talk about anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To administrate is to rule, and to manage is to arrange.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without authority, there will be no way for anyone to administrate and manage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps you can do something haphazardly, but you can never administrate affairs and conduct them on the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to conduct matters on the right track, there is no way to dispense with authority.</S>
