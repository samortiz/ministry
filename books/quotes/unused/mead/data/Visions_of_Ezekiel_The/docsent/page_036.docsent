   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE KINDS OF PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Within the nation of Israel, there were the priests, the kings, the prophets, the elders, and the people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This long record of twenty-three chapters covers these five kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Ezekiel 22:26 the priests violated the Word of God and profaned the holy things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They made no distinction between the holy and the profane, between the unclean and the clean.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord was profaned among them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because they did not minister the proper Word of God, they cheated and robbed the people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They did violence to the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some teachers today in Christianity minister the Lord's Word in a violent way, cheating and fooling the people by the wrong use of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ezekiel 22:27 says that the princes, the kings, were in the midst of the land like wolves ravening the prey, shedding blood, and destroying souls for dishonest gain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were anxious to grasp something for their own gain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The prophets, according to Ezekiel 22:25, were like roaring lions devouring souls.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They took the treasure and the precious things, causing many to be widows.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Like foxes in the desert, they loved to hide and live in a desolate place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is difficult for a fox to live in a proper house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when a house is desolate, foxes come in. The Lord condemned the prophets because they would not fill up the gap and make up the hedge during the time of the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This parallels today's situation when few Christians are willing to stand in the gap for the Lord's recovery and for the Lord's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During Ezekiel's time, there were false prophets who prophesied according to their own hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ezekiel used a parable to describe their manner of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said that it was like daubing the walls with untempered mortar 22:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What does it mean to use untempered mortar?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mortar is made from lime and must be thoroughly saturated with water before it is applied to a wall.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will give properly tempered mortar.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the mortar is not thoroughly saturated with water before it is applied to the wall, a rain will wash it away and the wall will crumble.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The meaning of this parable is that many prophets ministered the Word of God, but not in a properly tempered way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They were not fully saturated with the Holy Spirit and not fully soaked with the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many preachers and teachers today are simply daubing with untempered mortar.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They may give a good sermon, but when a storm comes, it is washed away like untempered mortar.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A word which is fully saturated with the Spirit and with the experience of life is absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When such a word is ministered, it will strengthen God's people to withstand whatever storms may come.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need teaching that is saturated with the Spirit and soaked with the proper experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not a matter of eloquence or a word that is pleasant to the ear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It must be real, solid, and thoroughly saturated with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of word will protect, strengthen, build together, and cause us to stand against any kind of storm.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An even poorer situation existed among the daughters of the people 13:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They not only prophesied falsely, they also prophesied when, in fact, the Lord had not spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even today, this kind of prophesying occurs frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people have said, "Thus saith the Lord," but the Lord did not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, a number of people have prophesied that Los Angeles will fall into the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some even predicted the exact date, but Los Angeles is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that they said, "Thus saith the Lord," but the Lord never said that.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such false prophecies are exposed and terminated when they are not fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The women in Ezekiel were not only prophesying falsely, but they were also practicing superstition and witchcraft.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, they sewed on a magic band, an amulet as a superstitious protection from the demons and the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They even sewed veils to hunt people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, today some pastors and preachers speak in a superstitious way, to comfort people in a false way, not according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord said that the elders had set up idols in their hearts 14:1-3 , and yet they came to inquire of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord would not be inquired of by them because of the idols in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They were not honest with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, they were ravening and robbing, taking others' treasures into their own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today's situation is very much the same.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The people, according to Ezekiel 22:29-30, used oppression and exercised robbery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They vexed the poor and needy and they oppressed the stranger wrongfully.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord was unable to find any one among them who could make up the hedge and stand in the gap.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The situation in today's Christianity is very much the same.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May the saints among us not be like these.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May the Lord fully deliver us from the degraded situation in today's Christianity.</S>
