   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have met some so-called evangelistic ministries or some preachers who have said that Jesus was not born of a virgin, that He is not the Son of God, that His blood is not for redemption, that He had died but did not resurrect, that His deeds and works before His death were patterns, and that His death is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The people who say this only care for what the Lord Jesus did during His thirty-three years on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They do not see the necessity of the Son of Man being lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They have not seen that the Son of Man would be lifted up just as Moses lifted up the bronze serpent in the wilderness John 3:14 ; they do not realize how important this matter is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They consider the Lord Jesus' death to be nothing more than the death of an ordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not believe that the Lord's death is the death of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They do not realize that if the Lord had not died, we would have to die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They take the Lord's teaching as unfulled cloth, and they try to cut out a patch to mend their torn garment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Friends, many people may not say this with their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But they say this in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I once met an unbeliever and gave him a copy of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After he read the four Gospels, he still would not admit that he was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He only admitted that his conduct was not as good as Jesus', and that he should imitate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only do unbelievers think this way, but Christians also think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you ask whether their Christian conduct is as good as the Lord's, they will readily answer no. But if you ask them what they should do, they answer that they have to donate more money to the church or do more good works.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They admit that their garment is torn, but they try to cut off a patch of the unfulled cloth the Lord's teachings to mend their tear.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the Lord said that if anyone tried to patch the old garment with unfulled cloth, the tear would become worse.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Friends, the Lord's word is very careful: "No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some think that since their garment is torn and they are a sinner before God, they should fast twice a week.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some wonder what they should do about their torn garment and decide to take five dollars out of their monthly income to give to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others say, "I have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps I should rise up every morning to read one chapter of the Bible; perhaps I should kneel down while I read."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Please be clear: I am not saying that we should not fast, pray, read the Bible, or offer our money.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am saying that it is futile to try to please God by doing these things or to count them as merits toward patching up our torn garment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if a Christian does these things, it is still wrong for him to regard them as merits toward pleasing God, because all these can be works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are those who say, "I have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I will try not to lie or go to movies, and I will try to be good and answer to my conscience so that the world will say that I am an upright and clean person and God will be pleased with me."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We think that since we have sinned, we should try to make up our lack by doing these things, and patch them on our torn garment piece by piece.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Lord Jesus said that this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You can try to mend the tear, and you can try to make many resolutions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But the more you mend and the more resolutions you make, the worse the tear becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, you may love the game of mahjong, but you are determined to stop playing it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the more you make up your mind not to play, the more you cannot stop playing; in fact, you find yourself playing the whole night.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may have a habit of smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you make up your mind to quit, you will find that you will be making resolutions over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may think this will never happen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in reality, it always happens.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more you mend, the worse will be the tear.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There was a student who spent only half an hour on his homework each day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the examination came, he tried to hastily prepare his lessons, only to find that he could not catch up with his work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He made up his mind that after his examination, he would spend two hours every day to prepare his lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But this resolution, instead of resulting in two hours of work every day, made him incapable of keeping up with even his half hour of work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A person once said that he hated lying, but that he always lied; he was determined not to lie anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was afraid to put this resolution down in his diary, for fear that others would see it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He put a big black circle in his diary every time he lied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a result, he found that his diary was full of black circles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the result of the work of mending; the tear becomes worse.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Previously, the tear could escape men's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the more one mends, the worse the tear becomes and the more obvious it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have not met all that many people in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But I can testify that I have never seen one person who could maintain his good works to the very end, without acknowledging the Lord Jesus as Savior and admitting that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He can be zealous for good works temporarily, and he can be inspired temporarily, but after a few months, everything is usually over with him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At any rate, his condition will never last for more than a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Someone once told me about the story of his cousin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This cousin was the chairman of the chamber of commerce, but he became a Christian through the influence of a missionary.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For a while, he helped the YMCA and other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But now he has become one of the strongest opponents of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He opposes Christians and has become a Buddhist.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I asked him why his cousin turned out this way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He answered that the gospel his cousin believed in was different from our gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His cousin wanted to help Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He thought that Jesus was too busy, and that he had to help Him out a little.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Actually, we are the ones who are too busy, and the Lord Jesus is here to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The gospel his cousin believed in is different from the gospel we believe in. I agree with his answer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Friends, we can never patch up our life with the life of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We cannot just accept His teaching and assume that He is here only as our Teacher or wonderful model.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do this, we are as far away from the kingdom of God as are all great sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some think that since we cannot mend with the unfulled cloth, we should mend with the old cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But the Lord Jesus was very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He only spoke of mending the old garment with the unfulled cloth; He did not speak of mending the old garment with old cloth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If unfulled cloth cannot mend the old garment, how can old cloth mend it?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We cannot mend the lack of today with the things of yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord never said anything about using old cloth to mend the old garment.</S>
