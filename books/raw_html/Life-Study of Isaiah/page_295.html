<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Having a Full Taste Fulfillment<br>at Christ's Second Coming</H2><P>The prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah in Isaiah 61:1-3 will have a full taste fulfillment at Christ's second coming, for the restoration of Israel unto the new heavens and new earth. The restoration age will usher in the new heaven and new earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah<br>Being upon Him</H2><P>Isaiah 61:1a says, "The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me." The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah was upon Christ in His first coming and will be upon Him in His second coming. When the Lord Jesus comes the second time, the striking significance will be that the Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Him. Here Isaiah especially adds in the word Lord. It is not just the Spirit of Jehovah but the Spirit of the Lord Jehovah. The Spirit of such a One will be upon the coming Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehovah Having Anointed Him</H2><P>Jehovah has anointed Christ (Isa. 61:1b; Matt. 3:16). He anointed Christ in His first coming. When Christ was baptized, He rose up from the water, and the Spirit of God came upon Him in a bodily form as a dove (Luke 3:21-22). Today the Spirit upon us is not in a visible figure. But on the day of Jesus' baptism, the Spirit came upon Him in a bodily form as a dove. It was very striking. The Spirit's coming upon Jesus after His baptism was the fulfillment of Isaiah 61:1 and was carried out to anoint the new King and introduce Him to His people. That anointing Spirit will still work in His second coming.</P><P>Jehovah anointed Him to do a number of things. First, He was anointed to bring good news, the gospel, to the afflicted, the suffering ones (Isa. 61:1c). Second, He was anointed to bind up the wounds of the brokenhearted (v. 1d) and third, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the release of those who are bound (v. 1e). This may also mean the release of those who are imprisoned. Fourth, Christ was anointed to proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah and the day of vengeance of our God (v. 2a). The acceptable year is toward God's people; the day of vengeance is toward the enemies of God's people. When Christ comes again to Israel, that will be the acceptable year to them and also the day of God's vengeance over the enemies of God's people, Antichrist and his followers. Fifth, Jehovah anointed Christ to comfort all who mourn (v. 2b). Mourning indicates that you are suffering more. At the beginning of your suffering, you may not mourn. Later, you mourn.</P><P>Sixth, Christ was anointed to grant to those who mourn in Zion a headdress instead of ashes, oil of gladness instead of mourning, and the mantle of praise instead of a spirit of heaviness (v. 3a). Zechariah tells us that when Christ comes again all the scattered Israelites will have returned to their forefathers' land. Two-thirds of them will be slaughtered by their enemies (13:8). Even today the nations around Israel hate Israel. The plight of Israel throughout the last twenty centuries is the fulfillment of the Lord's word in Matthew. The Lord lamented over Jerusalem (Matt. 23:37) and prophesied of its coming destruction (24:2). This prophecy was fulfilled when Titus and the Roman army came in A.D. 70 to destroy Jerusalem and the temple, not leaving one stone upon another. From that day the Israelites were scattered from their forefathers' land to all the nations for nearly nineteen hundred years. They were wandering for so many centuries, but in 1948 they were re-formed as a nation. Nineteen years later, in 1967, they captured back Jerusalem and the Golan Heights through the six-day war.</P>
