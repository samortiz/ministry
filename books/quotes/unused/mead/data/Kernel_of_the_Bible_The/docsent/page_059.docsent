   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MEETING ACCORDING TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By giving these illustrations I simply wish to point out our need to drop all the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If some saints desire to speak in tongues, give them that liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although you may not like it, you should not stop them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If some saints receive profit from calling on the name of the Lord, we should not criticize them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have no ordinances regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we still have ordinances, we cannot have the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To have the new man all the ordinances must be slain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not a matter of a loud meeting or a quiet meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a matter of a meeting according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should have no preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I am hungry, I have no preference; I simply desire to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day the Lord s disciples were hungry and broke the Sabbath by eating grain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today the saints must have the same liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not keep any regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the Brethren observe certain regulations, they kill their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we in the Lord s recovery must never set up regulations in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, we must come together as the Spirit leads.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not have regulations; we have the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As He leads, we move and act.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this also requires our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE ORDINANCES VERSUS THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Throughout the years, saints from various backgrounds have come to our meetings and tried to convince us to take their way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We told them that we could not take their way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we did, we would be sectarian, just as they were.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we did not ask them to change, we told them that they could not expect us to take their way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither would we expect them to take our way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Deep within, you may feel that you do not like our kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Who are you to criticize?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Are you the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are you sure that you are one hundred percent right?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>None of us can be sure of this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, we must learn to let others have their liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who criticize us are narrow-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the past a number have tried to convince us to take speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We replied, If you like to speak in tongues, feel free to do it in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will not stop you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But neither will we be convinced by you to practice a meeting centered on speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we did this, we would lose our ground of being general.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Others may enjoy pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who are you to criticize it, or to say that only your way is the right way?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is neither right nor fair.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are not happy with the practice of pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord in the meetings, then do not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But do not criticize others for doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Have you never read Romans 14?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A very clear word is given in Romans 14:2 and 3: One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not drop the ordinances, it will be impossible to have the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, we shall be a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some who read this message may already have been poisoned by the rumors that we are narrow and that we like to convince all others to be like us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is an absolute lie.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have no intention of convincing others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our expectation is that other Christians would give us liberty and that we would give them liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This surely is a fair attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you do not like to speak in tongues, then do not speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if I want to do it, please give me the liberty to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I may be profited by my speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is wrong with this?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You may not agree with the matter of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But why must you criticize us for calling on His name?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are nourished when we call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is no reason for you to reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Look at today s pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Where is the new man?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Instead of the new man, there are ordinances everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some of our brothers attended certain meetings and at the beginning they were charged not to say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They were told that if they said anything, they would be disciplined and put out of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What a sectarian spirit this is!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is dictatorship.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How could anyone with such an attitude have the new man?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Throughout the years, thousands of people have visited our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have not forbidden anyone to speak; our meetings are open.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you want to say something, you are free to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If I attend your meeting, will you have the same attitude?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If I began to speak, would you stop me?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is those who are narrow themselves who condemn others for being narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Brother Nee once told us that only robbers are afraid that others would steal from them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you are not one who steals from others, you will not have the fear that others will steal from you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If I am afraid that the brother standing near me will steal my wallet, surely I must be a thief myself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Likewise, those who accuse us of being narrow are the ones who are narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Examine the situation of their meetings to see if their meetings are open.</S>
