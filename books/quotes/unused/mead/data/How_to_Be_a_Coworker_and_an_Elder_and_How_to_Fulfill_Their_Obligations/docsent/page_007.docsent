   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. In the First Stage, the Stage of His Incarnation, from His Human Birth to His Death</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The full ministry of Christ is in three divine and mystical stages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first stage, the stage of His incarnation, began with His human birth and ended with His death, including the entire course of His human life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, His human birth, His passing through human living, and His death formed the stage of His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To Bring the Infinite God into the Finite Man</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In His full ministry in the first stage, the stage of His incarnation, Christ brought the infinite God into the finite man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some may think that this point is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, perhaps the most you can say is that Christ in His incarnation brought "God into man"; you cannot say that He brought "the infinite God into the finite man."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is our new language today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is infinite, and we human beings are finite.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In His full ministry in the stage of His incarnation, Christ brought the infinite God into the finite man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One is infinite and the other is finite how could the two become one?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, it was carried out by Christ in His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is truly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In general, most Christians today know only about the so-called Christmas to celebrate the birth of Christ as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, they have not seen anything concerning the mystical aspect of the full ministry of Christ in the stage of His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am very concerned and afraid that perhaps many co-workers and elders in the Lord's recovery have not entered into these deep and profound significances.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because of this, people find nothing interesting in the things which you speak, and they consider them something trite, something which even non-Christians have already heard.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if you use the new language to speak the things seen in the new culture, telling people that, in His full ministry in the stage of His incarnation, Christ brought the infinite God into the finite man, people will be stirred up and will be interested in listening to you, because this is something not found in the old culture but in the new culture in the divine and mystical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To Unite and Mingle the Triune God with the Tripartite Man</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His full ministry in the first stage of His incarnation, Christ also united and mingled the Triune God with the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Triune God is mysterious, and the tripartite man is difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we simply say that Christ united and mingled God with man, this is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, according to the new language of the new culture in the divine and mystical realm, we need to say that Christ united and mingled the Triune God with the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning the Triune God, the Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the entering in. Concerning the tripartite man, the spirit is the innermost part, the soul is in the middle, and the body is on the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not easy to explain clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nevertheless, we need to know these things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not have the knowledge, we cannot have the experience or the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not have the experience and enjoyment of Christ, we simply cannot gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then when we go to speak to others, we will have nothing to say and will be poor in utterance and void of words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if we compel ourselves to speak, what we speak will be shallow, simple, and trite.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some co-workers and elders often would say to me, "I don't dare to speak about these high truths because the believers whom I am serving cannot understand them according to their present spiritual condition."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My reply is: "It is not that they cannot understand, but it is that you cannot speak clearly."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is only after we have known, experienced, and gained Christ that we can speak to others, according to the new language in the Lord's recovery, concerning this Christ whom we have gained.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must learn to use the new language to speak the new culture in the divine and mystical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then people will listen to us with great pleasure and will definitely understand the things we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is only by this way that we are qualified to be co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Otherwise, we are outdated in the Lord's move in the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ministry of Christ was not only to unite but even more to mingle the Triune God with the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must be able to tell people clearly what it means to be united and what it means to be mingled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When two pieces of wood are connected together, they are united; when two things are ground into powder and blended together, they are mingled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is easy to speak concerning the union of God with man, but it is not easy to speak concerning the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we preach these truths, we need to explain them in detail.</S>
