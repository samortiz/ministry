We will try our best to answer them. Questions which are not edifying will not be answered. Unprofitable questions will not be answered.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RIGHTEOUS AS SHEEP IN THE KINGDOM</H2><P>Question: Matthew 25:31 to the end speaks of all nations being judged on the earth. In verse 37, it refers to the righteous. Who are these righteous ones? (Chang, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: These righteous ones are, of course, different from us today who have become righteous by believing in the Lord. By that time, the Lord Jesus will have already come to earth (vv. 31-32). Therefore, it will be a period of time after the seven years and before the thousand years; the age of grace will be over. God will deal with the world in the same way that He dealt with Israel in the Old Testament. The righteousness here, therefore, does not refer to our present righteousness, which is obtained by grace. The Lord calls them the righteous because they have treated the Jews ("one of these, the least of My brothers") kindly. Their being called righteous is to differentiate them from the cursed ones. The principle of this judgment follows Genesis 12:3, 27:29, and Numbers 24:5, 9, and 14. Please read Psalm 37:10-11 and 21-22 and compare with Matthew 5:5.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WOMEN TEACHING</H2><P>Question: In 1 Corinthians 14:34 and the verses after that, and in 1 Timothy 2:12, Paul says that the women are not permitted to speak or to teach in the churches. Should women be permitted to teach in the churches? (Chang, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: The Bible says they should not.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN THE BAPTIST</H2><P>Question: Before John the Baptist was born, he leaped in his mother's womb when his mother saw Mary. He later proclaimed many times that the Lord Jesus was the Lamb of God. When the Lord Jesus was baptized, John said that the heavens opened and the Spirit descended. He even heard God's own testimony. If so, why would he not know who the Lord Jesus was? Why did he send his disciples when he was in prison to ask who the Lord Jesus was? (Kang, Honan)</P><P>Answer: This event was recorded in Matthew 11:1-19. From the answer given by the Lord Jesus, we know that the faith of John the Baptist was weakened at that time. The answer of the Lord is in verses 4 through 6. At the end of His answer, the Lord said, "And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me." For John to ask such a question meant that he was stumbled by the Lord Jesus. What does this mean? John the Baptist was the forerunner of Christ. He was the last of the Old Testament prophets. Like all the other Old Testament prophets, he did not understand many of the things he preached. He was a Jew, and he could not help but be influenced by the hope of the Jews of that time, that the Messiah would be a king. Thus, when he preached that the kingdom of the heavens was at hand, he thought that the Lord Jesus was going to be a physical king on this earth. He had high hopes in the physical things, because he was the forerunner of Christ. He did not realize that the kingdom of the heavens has two stages: first the spiritual stage (in which Christ was despised by the world) and then the manifested stage (at which time Christ will be honored and worshipped by the world). The Christ that he testified of was not what he hoped He would be. This Christ did not emerge to establish a manifested kingdom, but instead He traveled all over to preach and to heal. He acted as if He had no ambition to be a king! In the meantime, John was imprisoned, and his own life was in great danger! As a result, his faith was shaken; he questioned whether the Lord Jesus was indeed the Christ. If He was, why did He fail to match his expectation? (Often, we are the same way.) He, therefore, sent his disciples to question the Lord Jesus. In essence, the Lord gave His answer as follows: "You should know who I am from the things that I have said and done (v. 4). You should not be stumbled just because My works are lowly and do not match your expectation. The Messiah must first suffer and then enter into His glory." May our hearts not be stumbled because Christ was despised.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
