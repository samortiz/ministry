[1]  There are two great mysteries in the Bible, one is the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit, and the other is the Person of Christ.
[2]  Christ is both God and man, and the two natures, divinity and humanity, are complete in Him.
[3]  Therefore, He cannot compare with God, but is merely all-excelling, being the most outstanding, the noblest, and the highest among the creatures for the Word is not God who is uncreated; rather, He is the chief of all creation.
[4]  Under careful examination the false doctrine of the Arians is found to contain three points which are contrary to the revelation of the Scripture: 1 The Bible says clearly that the Word was God John 1:1 , yet Arius asserted that the Word is not the self-existent God and therefore maintained that Christ's divinity is imperfect and cannot compare with God.
[5]  Although the Person of Christ is a great mystery, the Bible speaks very clearly regarding this matter.
[6]  In the book of Isaiah it says, In that day there shall be a sprout of Jehovah for beauty and glory Isa 4:2, Darby .
[7]  This sprout is Christ, who came forth from Jehovah God.
[8]  Therefore, He, as the sprout that came out from God and possesses the Godhead, is for the manifestation of God's beauty and glory.
[9]  Although the Lord was a man conceived and born through a virgin, men called Him God is with us, for when He was in the flesh He was God with men.
[10]  Now all this took place that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
[11]  After Peter had received the revelation from God, he declared, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God Matt 16:16 .
[12]  At the time of the Lord's transfiguration on the mountain, God spoke out of the cloud and said, This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight Matt 17:5 .
[13]  This not only proves that the Lord Jesus is God who can forgive sins, but also indicates that the Lord confesses Himself to be God, the God who alone can forgive sins.
[14]  The Lord Jesus said, That all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father.
[15]  Here the Lord shows us that He enjoys the same honor with the Father because He is the Father, and He is also God.
[16]  There are numerous verses in the Epistles which state that the Lord is Lord as well as the Son of God, thus strengthening the evidence that He has God's divine nature and the Godhead.
[17]  In addition to these, the following few verses clearly and definitely show us that our Lord is God; He is no less than the unique God Himself.
[18]  Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever Rom 9:5 .
[19]  His visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men Isa 52:13-14 .
[20]  The Old Testament shows us that Christ needed to be a man.
[21]  In order to be a man He needed to become the seed of the woman as well as a seed of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Jesse, David, etc. At the beginning of the New Testament, Matthew chapter one shows us that Christ actually became the Son of Abraham and the Son of David v. 1 ; He also became a descendant of Isaac, Jacob, Judah, and Jesse vv.
[22]  Finally, in Matthew 26:63-64 before His crucifixion the high priest who was judging Him asked Him if He was the Son of God.
[23]  In all the verses mentioned above whether in the Old or New Testaments, we can clearly see that on the one hand Christ is God and on the other hand He is man.
[24]  On the one hand He is man, and on the other hand He is God He is a mysterious One, God as well as man, man as well as God.
[25]  It says: He was the firstborn son of Mary Luke 2:7 ; He is the firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 ; He is the firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 ; He is the firstborn from among the dead Col 1:18 ; He is the Firstborn of God Heb 1:6 ; and He is the Firstborn of the dead Rev 1:5 .
[26]  We must see that He is God, and He is also man; He is the Creator, and He is also a creature; He is the I AM; He is also the Firstborn; He is without beginning, and He is also with a beginning.
