   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY CITY DESCENDING FROM HEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us see the details of the holy city, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 21:9-10 says, "And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the angel wanted to show John the great harlot in Revelation 17:1-3, he led him into the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In God's eyes and in the eyes of those who are inspired by the Holy Spirit, the harlot is one who dwells in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She lives in a place where there is no life and no fruit a barren land.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Men today can behold high church buildings, they can take part in well-prepared Sunday services, and they can admire the ability of man, but in the sight of God, everything that has its origin in Babylon is in the wilderness; it is deserted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the angel showed John the wife of the Lamb, he brought him up to a great and high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There he showed him the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was from a great and high mountain that John beheld this sight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This reveals that if we desire to see the eternal vision of God, we must be brought by Him to a great and high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are not standing spiritually on a high mountain, we will not see those who are living on the plain, we will not see the New Jerusalem, nor will we see the ultimate work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Moses reached the Jordan with the children of Israel, what did God tell him to do?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He commanded him to go up to the top of Mount Pisgah and lift up his eyes to behold the land which He had promised.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This also tells us that in order to receive vision and revelation and to behold the plan of God, we must be upon the height.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Never think that just being an ordinary Christian day by day, not committing any great sin, is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must realize that whenever we take this position, God's eternal plan is nothing more to us than doctrine and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must hope to do some spiritual climbing and have some spiritual attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should expect to climb a high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only when we do this will we be able to see the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What God desires to do, He will accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What God has purposed in eternity past, He will obtain in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, there must be overcomers to bring in the kingdom, and then there must be overcomers to bring in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the problem is, who will be the overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be an overcomer, we must have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is no revelation, it is easy to receive anything as a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we must remember that knowledge can never produce fruit; only revelation is fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in order to have revelation we must go up to the high mountain; we cannot dwell in the plain.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is some difficulty in climbing a mountain because we must exercise our strength to climb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot reach the peak unless we make some effort.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May God grant us this spiritual attainment and deliver us from the low plain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not think that just being saved and not wanting anything more is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God must save us from this low level of living and show us His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only when we are on the high mountain will we receive revelation.</S>
