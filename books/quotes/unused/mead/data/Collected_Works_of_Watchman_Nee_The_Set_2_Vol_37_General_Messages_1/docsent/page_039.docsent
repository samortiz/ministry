   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY THE CONTINUATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BOOK OF ACTS Scripture Reading: Acts 28:30-31; Rev 1:11-12, 20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are sixty-six books in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we come to the end of many of these books, we can say that the book is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are fifty chapters in Genesis, and when we come to the end, we sense that we have come to the end. The Gospel of Matthew has twenty-eight chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we come to chapter twenty-eight, we feel that we have come to the end. When we come to the Romans 16, we also feel that this is the end. When we read Revelation 22, we also feel that this is the end.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But there is one book in the Bible which does not have an end. All the other sixty-five books have an end. But one book does not have an end. This book is the Acts of the Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why does Acts 28 end the way it does?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you read Acts 28, you feel as if the book has not yet concluded.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This book does not have an ending.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Acts of the Apostles is a book without an ending because this book is still being continued.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps the acts of the first century apostles have ended, but the book of Acts as a whole has not yet ended.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Until now we still have the Acts of the Apostles with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This book has not yet ended.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working" John 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that since the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man, God has been working until now, and the Lord is also working.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the book of Acts?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The book of Acts is not a record of the work of Paul or a record of the work of Peter or John.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The book of Acts is a record of the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who can say that God has done no work after Acts 28?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who can say that God's work stopped after Acts 28?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The book of Acts does not have an ending.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After chapter twenty-eight, many of God's vessels are still carrying on with His work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His work is continuing and has not stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything was not over after Paul worked in Rome for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul lived in Rome and was later martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>None of these things are recorded in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter, Paul, and John are three important persons, yet none of their endings were recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can we say that the book of Acts has ended?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's testimony can never be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We could say the same thing even if there was a twenty-ninth chapter, or a thirtieth chapter, or even a hundredth chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If one wanted to write more, new things could always be added.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why Acts stops at chapter twenty-eight.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although the written record no longer continued after chapter twenty-eight, God's work has been going on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The work in the first century was not the peak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For four thousand years, God has been working.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we say that Acts 28 was the peak, we must be at the bottom of the hill; we must have come down from the peak.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not true because the Lord said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not assume that God's work reached its peak at the time of Paul, and we should not consider that God's work reached its peak at the time of Martin Luther either.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No, the first century was not the end of God's work, nor was the sixteenth century the end of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even last century was not the end of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His work will go on until the kingdom and even until the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is always advancing; He never stops.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we know this and believe in this, we will praise our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man always has a misconception that his age is the worst age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the time of Martin Luther some thought this way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the time of John Wesley some thought this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We consider Martin Luther's time a marvelous age and John Wesley's time a marvelous age also.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While we consider their ages marvelous, some who come fifty years after us will say that we were at a marvelous age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are afraid that man will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But God never stops.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every year, He knows what He is doing, and He knows how much He will work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every year, He does what He wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is a God who goes on day by day; He is always advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is a God who keeps on advancing!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every time God advances, He finds some vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the book of Acts, God found some vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the time of Martin Luther, God found a vessel, and at the time of John Wesley, He also found a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every time there is a spiritual revival, God finds some vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Where is God's vessel today?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is true that the Father is working until now.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But who is continuing to work together with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Who can say, "I also am working"?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the crucial question.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brothers and sisters, if God grants us light and if we see God's truth, we will admit that God is after the same vessel today that He ordained at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This vessel is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In other words, God is not after an individual vessel today, but a corporate one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Since God is after a corporate vessel, His children must be brought to the awareness of the Body of Christ and the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Otherwise, they are useless in His hand and can never fulfill His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Revelation 1 tells us that the churches are golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God does not simply say that the churches are golden; He says that the churches are golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If the churches are just golden, they cannot satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God says that the churches are golden lampstands because golden lampstands shine and enlighten.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God desires the church to be a shining vessel, a vessel of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>From the beginning God has ordained that the church be a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The church, not individuals, is a lampstand before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is not enough just to be golden, and it is not enough just to be of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There must be the shining for God and the testimony for Him before the church can be considered the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, the church exists for God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Anything that is not golden is not the church, and anything that is not a lampstand is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Anything that does not have life within is not the church, and anything that does not have the testimony within is also not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The church must realize what God is doing and what He is after in this age; it must realize what God's testimony on the earth today is.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only then can the church be considered the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Simply put, God's work is always advancing.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He is still seeking this vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>His vessel today is the same vessel He intended to have at the beginning; the church is this vessel, not single individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Some may ask: What does it mean that the overcomers come out of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is true that there needs to be overcomers that come out of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But even the testimony of the overcomers is maintained on behalf of the corporate whole; it is not for individuals alone.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The overcomers are not men who consider themselves extraordinary, better than others, and who put everyone else aside.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The overcomers work on behalf of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They do the work, while the whole church gains the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The overcomers are not for themselves; they stand on the ground of the church, and they are there to bring the whole church to perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They stand on the ground of the church and maintain their stand on behalf of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Even the victories of the overcomers are corporate victories.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The vessel God is after is a corporate one.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Therefore, we have to learn to live the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In order to live the Body life, we have to deny the natural life and be judged and dealt with by God in a deep way.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We must learn obedience, and we must also learn fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In this way, we will have the chance of becoming God's vessel.</S>
