   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having No Natural Affection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Shepherding and Care</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, if there are those who have physical illness, they can share that matter briefly in the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps the brothers and sisters will receive the burden immediately to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this way, we can see that the small group meetings include shepherding and nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, the church in Taichung has over seven hundred brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have ten or more to a small group, we can have over fifty small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the ten or more brothers and sisters in each small group can shepherd one another and nourish one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This will be more thorough than the care of eight or ten elders.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason, the function of the small group is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The small group meeting should carefully avoid one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If fifteen brothers and sisters have been meeting for half a year, they will be very familiar with one another and will care for and love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After half a year, their number may increase to over thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At that time they should divide into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, everyone may be unwilling to divide.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time we should be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps the natural affection has become too strong among them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to see that we only have love between the brothers and sisters; we do not have any tie in friendship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything of the natural affection has to be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We only care for one another by the love in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only then will the Lord have a chance to spread His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE HEART BEING THE GOOD GROUND,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>TRUSTING IN GOD S GRACE TO TAKE THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we truly desire to take the biblical way, we must pay the price to live a revived and renewed life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not depend on ourselves, but should depend on the resurrected Lord and His power, His authority, and His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every week we should consecrate two evenings for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should do this not only for a year or two, but until we see the Lord face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It requires much prayer on our part so that we will deny ourselves and will not trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only by this can we persevere and put such a thing into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus spoke to the disciples the parable of the sower in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said that the sower went forth to sow and that four kinds of results were borne.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The seeds that fell by the wayside are the first kind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The birds came and ate them all up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that although the Lord sowed the seeds, some hearts are hardened by the traffic of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This typifies the heart of some being hardened by communication with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a result, it becomes hard for the seed to get in vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second are those who appear to be good ground outwardly, but actually are shallow and rocky places.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There being not much earth, the seeds immediately sprang up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and because they had no root, they were dried up vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the third case the ground was the normal earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But it was filled with thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The thorns typify the anxiety of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the temptations of the lusts v. 7 . When we have these three kinds of things, it will be difficult for the Lord s word to have the ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fourth kind of result comes from those that fall into good ground v. 8 . The good ground typifies the good heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It does not have the worldly traffic to harden it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nor does it have hidden sins, the anxiety of this age, or the deceitfulness of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only this kind of heart can receive the Lord s word and can allow it to grow and bear fruit, even up to a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This parable of the Lord is very scientific.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He pointed out laws from our everyday, practical lives.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot break these laws.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, we have to deny our self, trust the Lord, and depend on His resurrection power, His authority in ascension, His Spirit, and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way, our heart will have no worldly communication, hidden sins, or bondages of lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead it will be fully a fertile ground.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only then can the will of the Lord be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is what the new way is striving for today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything in this new way requires the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul said, But by the grace of God I am what I am...yet not I, but the grace of God with me 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For this reason, all of us have to know the grace of God, which is just the very God enjoyed by us in death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only when we are in this One can we be the top kind of person to take the new way that is humanly unattainable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This way is absolutely not in the old creation or the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather it is in the new creation and the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why in everything we have to trust in the resurrected Lord, in His resurrection power, in His authority in ascension, and in His all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taichung on March 29, 1989</S>
