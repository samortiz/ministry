   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5 HAVING BEEN MADE DEAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So then, my brothers,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>you also have been made dead to the law</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>through the body of Christ so that you might be</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>that we might bear fruit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 7:4 Scripture Reading:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 7:4, 15-19</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Romans 7 is a very familiar chapter to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not only is it familiar to us in our reading, it is also familiar to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We often read Romans 7 and often practice Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What the Lord wants me to speak on today is the way to be delivered from the demand of the law, that is, the way to be delivered from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>WHO CAN RECEIVE GOD S DELIVERANCE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before we speak on the subject of deliverance and the way to be delivered, I will first mention one qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What type of persons are qualified to speak about deliverance?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brothers and sisters, although God s deliverance is for everyone, not everyone receives deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although it is possible for everyone to be delivered from the law, not everyone is actually delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problem is absolutely not with God but with man, because man does not want to be delivered and has not paid the price for deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostle who wrote Romans 7 was eventually delivered because he paid the price; he hated something and he willed to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The biggest problem that confronts us today is that we are not yet delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet I would like to ask if we have deeply hated the temper that we have not been able to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have we deeply hated the sin that causes us to fall and the things that stumble us all the time?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Or are we willing to say that sinning is something common to all Christians and is, therefore, unavoidable?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do we sense a hatred for the unclean thoughts, the sinful deeds, the entangling temper, and the evil lusts; do we look for deliverance from them?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The apostle not only speaks of deliverance in this chapter but also of his feeling before his deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before he was delivered, he hated what he repeatedly did.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not practice what he willed, and he did what he hated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first question is whether we love or hate the things that we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The apostle experienced deliverance because he deeply hated and desperately sought for deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was so disgusted with his life of sin that he could no longer tolerate it; he felt that he could no longer go along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He hated it so much that he wished to die.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He would not allow it to go on for a moment longer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He experienced the deliverance because he had such a determination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brothers and sisters, do you have such a hunger within?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you ever said that you cannot continue to live a life that is bound and entangled with sin?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Have you realized how loathsome such a living is?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, the words which God commissioned me to speak this morning are only for those who desire deliverance and consider that the level of their Christian life is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My words are not for those who are self-satisfied and content with living in sin and failure.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are for those who seek deliverance and have not found the way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are not for those who think it is all right to lose one s temper, to be lustful, or have unclean thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Neither are they for those who think that they only need to confess when they have failed and that everything will be all right as soon as God forgives their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The victory in Romans 7 is for those who experience the failures like those in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anyone who is not saved cannot experience this kind of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only those who hate their present living and do not wish to continue with such a living can experience this victory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who live in failure and sin, not realizing that they have to reject these things, will never find God s deliverance coming to them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every time a person wants to have spiritual growth in his life before God, he must first be dissatisfied with his present living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All growth begins from dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One must be pressed to such an extent that he feels he cannot go on anymore, that he has reached the end of himself, and that his living is unacceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He must consider that it is no longer acceptable to be bound by the self, the world, and sin; and it is no longer acceptable that what he wills, he does not do, and what he hates, he does.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He has to recognize that such a contradictory life cannot go on and that there must be a way out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God will grant His deliverance only to those who are living under these conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, we have a great need before God to ask Him to give us the grace to not be content with our life of sin and failure.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every victory begins with a realization of our failure and wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everyone who desires deliverance must first be so pressed that he feels he cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only then can he experience deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am merely telling the way; actual deliverance can only come from God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In other words, while I am giving the light, only God gives the revelation directly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Light cannot save; only revelation can save.</S>
