The Lord has graced us. Three brothers and three sisters are standing on the testimony of oneness, serving Him, and glorifying Him. Other than the Lord's Day morning meeting, we will have a small meeting on the Lord's Day afternoon, the Lord willing. There are over ten brothers and sisters who come regularly to the meetings. We started the Lord's table meeting on July 16. Seven to eight people come each time. Please pray much for us. Enclosed please find X dollars for The Christian; the rest is for needy brothers and sisters. May the Lord bless this small sum as He blessed the five loaves and two fishes.</p><p>Weak members in the Lord,<br />Lee Wen-han and Hsu Yi-min, August 15</p><h2 class="head2">Mo-Gan-Shan, Chekiang Province</h2><p>I regret that I could not attend Brother Watchman Nee's special conference. Although the mail route is clear, land transportation is still blocked. I hope that more publications will come out so that those in the inland regions, who cannot listen in person, can receive the help from the literature. The church meetings in the mountains have been going on as before on the Lord's Day. There are still regular Bible classes and home prayer meetings. Thank the Lord for His great grace; His work is still able to go on in this hidden corner. Both my family and the Yu family have no leading to leave the mountain. Circumstantially, there is no possibility of leaving the mountain anyway. May the Father guide us so that by the time we leave the mountain, a few families can join us. The standard of living on the mountain has gone up quite a bit. Of course, we have to live in a simple way in everything. Greetings to Brother Nee and all the saints. Be comforted that we are safe in the mountains.</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Sun Chen Yao-jen, August 11</p><h2 class="head2">Nan-Sha, Chekiang Province</h2><p>A few brothers from Nan-Sha found jobs in Shanghai. This is wonderful. Presently, the east and north sides of Sha-Di are disaster areas because of the flood. Much of the saints' land is flooded. More is about to be flooded. The saints can only look solely to the Lord and pray in oneness at set times in the morning. There is no other way. Please pray for all the things that are happening to the brothers in Nan-Sha.</p><p>Brother Kao Jin-fu, July 7</p><h2 class="head2">Kuling, Kiangsi Province</h2><p>My whole family is in Kuling and has been preserved by the Lord. Last year Brother Hu Bao-shan and his family left Kuling for Hunan. They are now staying at Shen Jou-shing's drugstore in Shang-Chiao, Tao-Yuan. Brother Cheng Tso and his family of five moved to inland regions in Kiangsi. The Lord's Day morning meeting in Kuling is conducted according to the number in attendance. Sometimes we preach the gospel, and sometimes it is for perfecting the saints. The Lord's table meeting is in the afternoon. The number ranges from twenty to more than thirty. There are more sisters than brothers. Please continue to pray for us in Kuling. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Xin-liang, July 25</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_114.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_116.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 115</div><br></body></html>
