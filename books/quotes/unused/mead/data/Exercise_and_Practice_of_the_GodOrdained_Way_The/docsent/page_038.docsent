   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL BY VISITING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have learned from church history, and it is confirmed by the Bible, that to preach the gospel effectively, we must go where the people are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first one to visit people for the preaching of the gospel was the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He came all the way from the heavens, and He even changed His form to become a man in order to visit sinners 1 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He went from city to city and from village to village to visit people Luke 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He sent the twelve to visit people Matt 10:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later He sent seventy to visit people Luke 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's word in John 15:16 is His sending of us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He says, "I appointed you," He is referring to all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has set us in a certain position for a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should as a command go forth and bear fruit, and our fruit should remain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the God-ordained way to practice the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, and we all must exercise to promote it because it is not easy to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The old way of having a big congregation with one speaking and the rest listening does not accomplish much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It can only edify people in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was in a Brethren assembly for more than ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I continually went there to sit and listen so that I could be edified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That little Brethren assembly was there for over fifty years, yet no other church was raised up by them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the mid-1970s, we had more than one thousand saints meeting in Orange County, but today the number is much less.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For years we have been very busy going to the meetings yet with very little positive result.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all must realize that to stay in the old way does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christianity has tested this old way throughout the centuries, and they now agree that their way does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They cannot go on in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I came to this country in 1958, I heard that the United States had a population of two hundred million and that half of the people were Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today the population might be over two hundred forty million, and only one hundred twenty million may be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In over thirty years, there has only been an increase of twenty million.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is less than a one percent increase per year.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christianity has nearly come to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Due to this, the Southern Baptists have begun to pick up the practice of door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Last winter they began to do this in Texas, and this summer they practiced it in Las Vegas.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BEING DISCIPLED FOR BEARING MUCH FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not that this biblical way, the God-ordained way, does not work; it is that we are not faithful to this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In John 15 the Lord used the word "disciples."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and you shall become My disciples" v. 8 . The reason we are not fruitful is because we have not been discipled that much by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to become His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be discipled is to change our way, our position, and our character, that is, not to be natural.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we go out to visit people in a natural way, our going out will be ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must be discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For someone to play the piano properly, he must be willing to be tutored, "discipled."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, he has to practice many hours to become discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be discipled is to get out of the natural way and take another way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Are we willing to be discipled?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a matter of whether we could or should be discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is altogether a matter of our being willing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everybody should be discipled and can be discipled, but not many would be discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is why nearly twenty centuries have passed, and the Lord still has not returned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not many are living in the United States for the New Testament priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not many are willing to be discipled.</S>
