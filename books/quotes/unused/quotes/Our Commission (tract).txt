We preach the gospel of Jesus Christ that sinners may be saved to become the members of Christ for the building up of His Body
After the Lord's ascension, the early believers followed His pattern and went out to visit people everywhere with the gospel of Jesus Christ
We have been commissioned to preach the gospel, but our commission also includes nourishing those who have been saved through us
To accomplish this, we visit the new believers in their homes or meet with them in any place available, week after week
By these, they are fed with the riches of Christ and are supplied with the divine life that they may grow spiritually
Only through such regular and consistent nourishment can the new ones stay alive and be healthy in the Christian life
God desires that all the believers would be perfected for the work of the ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ
It is clear from Paul's words that the Lord has entrusted this perfecting work to His believers; thus, it is also a part of our commission
The saints are perfected through mutual shepherding, mutual care, mutual intercession, and mutual teaching in small groups
During these small group meetings, the brothers and sisters ask questions of one another and answer each other in mutuality
By being open to the good deposit in one another, all the saints can be perfected by all the members in these small groups
To prophesy in this way is to speak for God and to speak forth Christ so that the saints can be edified and the churches can be built
These can be either the meetings of an entire local church, if the church is small, or the district meetings of a larger church
