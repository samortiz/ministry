        <h2 class="head1">HAVING THE LOVING AND<br />
FORGIVING HEART OF OUR FATHER GOD<br />
AND THE SHEPHERDING AND SEEKING SPIRIT<br />
OF OUR SAVIOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>I love Luke 15. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to Him to hear Him.&rdquo; The gentlemen and righteous men were not joined to Him, but the tax collectors and sinners were. Therefore, the Pharisees murmured and complained again. Then the Lord spoke three parables. The first is concerning a shepherd seeking the one, unique, lost sheep. Of one hundred, this one was a lost one, so the shepherd came purposely for him. Why did the Lord go to a house full of sinners and tax collectors? It was because among them there was one lost sheep of His, whom He had come to seek. The second parable is concerning a woman who lit a lamp and swept the house to seek her lost coin. The third parable is about the prodigal son. The shepherd is the Son, the woman is the Spirit, and in the parable of the prodigal son there is the Father. As the prodigal son was returning, he was preparing and considering what to speak to his father. He prepared himself to say, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants&rdquo; (vv. 18-19). While he was walking and thinking like this, the father saw him. Verse 20 says, &ldquo;But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately.&rdquo; That the father saw the son a long way off was not an accident. From the time the son left home, the father must have gone out to look and wait for his coming back every day. We do not know how many days he watched and waited. When the father saw him, he ran to him. This is the Father&rsquo;s heart. The father interrupted the son while he was speaking his prepared word. The son wanted to speak the word he had prepared, but the father told his servants to bring the robe, the ring, and the sandals and to prepare the fattened calf. A teacher among the Brethren told me that in the whole Bible we can see God run only one time, in Luke 15, where the father sees the returning prodigal son. He ran; he could not wait. This is the Father&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>To speak truthfully, we have lost this spirit among the co-workers, elders, and vital groups. We do not have such a loving spirit that loves the world, the worst people. We classify people, choosing who are the good ones. Throughout my years I have seen many good ones. Eventually, very few of the good ones remain in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Rather, so many bad ones remain. In the beginning I also was one who classified them as bad, but today many bad ones are still here. If it were according to our concept, where would God&rsquo;s choosing be? Our choosing depends upon God, who chose His people before the foundation of the world...It is not up to our choosing, our selection. It is based upon God&rsquo;s eternal selection.</p>
<p>Do not classify people. Who can tell what they will be? When I was playing mah-jongg at the age of eighteen or nineteen, who would have thought that this mah-jongg player would sit in America many years later to talk to people about the Lord? Who brought me here? It was Christ as the heavenly ladder. He brought me up to God in the heavens, and He brought me down to the earth with Himself. The heavenly ladder has many steps, and God brought me up not in one year but over many years. When I arrived at the top, I met God, and He equipped me and sent me back down. I came down, first to Taiwan, then to the South Asian islands, and then to this country. Now I am here. The pastor in my hometown did not say of me, &ldquo;I know this man. He is a gambler, a mah-jongg player. I do not like him, and I do not want to have such a member in my church.&rdquo; Rather, he visited me, and one day very mysteriously the seeking Spirit was seeking in me, like the woman in Luke 15.</p>
<p>Why would I spend so much time on this subject? I want to shepherd and disciple you from the Bible so you can see this matter and have a change. I am discipling you to change your concept. The God-man concept is that Christ came to save sinners, especially the top sinners. He saves the &ldquo;gangsters,&rdquo; even the leader of the &ldquo;gangsters,&rdquo; Saul of Tarsus. Paul said, &ldquo;Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:15). Paul could say this because he was the top sinner opposing Christ. He rebelled against Christ, but while he was rebelling, Christ knocked him down, called him, and saved him. Jesus Himself said, &ldquo;Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill...I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners&rdquo; (Matt. 9:12-13). That is why He was there among the sinners and tax collectors, eating and feasting with them, reclining at the table and enjoying with them.</p>
<p>lf we lose this spirit, whether we are elders, co-workers, or serving ones, we are finished. This is the main reason why we are so barren, bearing no fruit for so many years. Recently, a brother went to care for a couple, but he did not have this spirit. He visited them no more than ten times and became disappointed. Since the couple had no heart for this brother, he reported that it was useless to visit them further. When Pastor Yu visited me, I did not care for him, but he continued to come for three or four months, week after week. We need to have this spirit. We all have to change our concept. Therefore, we need discipling. We have too much of the natural thought. We need to be discipled to have the divine concept, the concept of the Father&rsquo;s heart and the heart of the Lord Jesus, who came to save sinners.</p>
<p>We like to rank people, saying that the co-workers are the first rank, while others are the subsequent ranks. This is absolutely wrong. There is no rank. We all are the people in the world and in the flesh...I do not even consider myself qualified to be a pastor. I am just the same as the other saints. Once we condemn anyone, we lose the position to take care of that one. Condemnation does not stir up our care for others. Who among the human race is lovable? In the eyes of God, everyone is not lovable in themselves, yet God still loves them; that is, He loves the world. I do not prefer to have this kind of fellowship with you, but I must speak in this way for your sake in order to shepherd you.</p>
<p>We all have to admit that we are on the same level, with only a little difference in degree. Regardless of how much higher one seems than another, we are still at the same level. We all need to see this; then our mouth will be shut. We should not talk about others; we are the same as they. If we are bothered by other people&rsquo;s criticizing, our spirit may tell us that we also criticize others. Then our mouth will be shut. We are the same as others. One may criticize ten percent, while another criticizes fifteen percent. We are the same; we are all criticizers.</p>
<p>We must humble ourselves. Pride is the biggest enemy of God. God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble (James 4:6; 1 Pet. 5:5). Whenever we criticize others, we miss grace and instead suffer God&rsquo;s resistance. We all must learn to shepherd one another. This does not mean that since I am shepherding you, I do not need your shepherding. I need your shepherding. We all have defects and shortcomings. Everyone has defects. Therefore, we have to humble ourselves to meet God&rsquo;s grace. This strengthens our spirit to visit people and to take care of people regardless of whether they are good or bad. Regardless of what they are, we must go to visit them and keep visiting.</p>
<p>We need to have this kind of love and go to tell all the dormant ones who think that the church condemns them that the church does not condemn anyone. Rather, the church wants to see all the dormant ones come back. If they all would come back, I would weep with tears of thanksgiving to the Lord. The Lord can testify for me that I do not condemn anyone. We have no qualification to condemn anyone. Without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we would be the same as the dormant ones. Therefore, we must love them. It all depends upon love, as the wise king Solomon said, &ldquo;Love covers all transgressions&rdquo; (Prov. 10:12). We love people. We love the opposers, and we love the top rebels. I really mean it. We love them and do not hate them. Who am I? I am not qualified to condemn or to hate. Am I perfect? Even the prophet Isaiah, when he saw the Lord, said, &ldquo;Woe is me, for I am finished! / For I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell&rdquo; (Isa. 6:5). Who is clean today? If we criticize people and say something bad about them, we are not clean. (<em>A Word of Love to the Co-workers, Elders, Lovers, and Seekers of the Lord,</em> pp. 27-28, 29-30, 31, 31-32, 32-33)</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
