   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having Loved His Own Who Were in the World,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He Loved Them to the Uttermost</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second part of verse 1 says, "Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you do not love anyone in this world, you can allow many things to go unattended.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you have no relatives, friends, or children, you can die peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But there were many whom the Lord loved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I were close to death and I had many loved ones, the final thing that I would do would be to give them my will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what man would do, but this was not what the Lord did.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He washed the disciples' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord loved His own who were in the world, and He washed their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He could do a thousand other things, but He did not.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, He chose to wash the disciples' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did this because of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This makes the foot-washing a very wonderful matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Lord had not loved His own who were in the world, foot-washing would not have been so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But foot-washing is very wonderful because the Lord did this to those whom He loved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord, having loved His own who were in the world, loved them to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, He washed their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is an expression of the Lord's uttermost love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan Having Already Put into the Heart of Judas</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>the Thought to Betray Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 2 says, "And while supper was taking place, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, that he should betray Him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was not a common occurrence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here was a man who was going to betray the Lord, and the Lord knew this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was facing a most difficult and critical situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is like a man who cannot leave his house even though he knows that it is going to collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unlike many rich people in Shanghai, who give up their houses and move away when they collapse, he does not have any money and cannot move anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What would you do if there was a war in this place and the condition was critical?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What would you do if you knew that danger was approaching in five minutes, that a bomb would fall or the enemy would arrive?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Would you still be washing or shining your shoes?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course not!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We would not be doing insignificant things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, we would be doing the most important things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During this critical juncture, the Lord washed the disciples' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you think that He was wrong to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Foot-washing must be a very important thing because it was done at the time when Judas was about to betray the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Father Having Given All</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>into the Lord's Hands</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 3 says, "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands..."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This refers to His exaltation, glory, power, honor, crown, and enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord knew that He was to receive all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you knew that you were about to be exalted and would receive glory, power, and honor, what would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You would surely do something that prepared you for your exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Perhaps you would refurnish your house to make room for guests and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You would do some crucial things that would match your new status.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord knew that He was about to depart from this world, and He knew that the Father had given all into His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet He washed the disciples' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This shows that foot-washing must be a very crucial thing in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He Himself washed the disciples' feet, and He also charged the disciples to wash one another's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, we must not pass by John 13 easily; we should not look at this chapter lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before coming to the subject, I wanted to first consider the background behind the foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have seen that this act was done when the Lord was about to depart out of this world to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord loved His own who were in the world to the uttermost; He knew that there was danger before Him because Judas was about to betray Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He also knew that the Father had given all into His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Against this background, the Lord washed the disciples' feet and charged them to wash one another's feet.</S>
