<P>A number of questions may be asked in the group meeting. Some will be concerning the truth, and others will be concerning life. In this way there will be the mutual teaching of the truth and the experience of life. This does not mean that we do not need books to help us. We still need the help from books such as Truth Lessons and Life Lessons. In our fellowship with the new ones, we can tell them that it is best to have books like these in our homes so that we can study a part of a lesson when we want to learn something concerning the truth or life. Then when we are in the group meeting, we can refer to these books when we answer something. We can tell the new ones that they can read more concerning a certain truth at home in their spare time. When we take this way, the answers to the questions in the group meeting will become very rich. This way gives the opportunities to every attendant to use their knowledge and their experience to answer questions. If a new believer is brought into a group meeting, and he attends over forty-five group meetings a year, he will learn much truth. All of us start the meeting in our homes, and everyone in the meeting is a leader and a teacher.</P><P>The scriptural basis for the group meetings is in Hebrews 10:24 and 25. When Paul wrote this, he was talking to the Hebrew brothers and telling them not to forsake their own meeting, their Christian meeting. This is because some of the Jewish brothers had left their Christian meeting and had gone back to their Judaistic gathering. In our present situation, we need to have a meeting that is our own meeting. We should not forsake our own meeting. We must help all the saints to realize that the group meeting is their own meeting.</P><P>The group meeting is a meeting of mutuality in which all the saints participate. Everyone can start the meeting in his home, everyone can fellowship, everyone can intercede, and everyone can render the mutual care and the shepherding. In this way everyone in the group will be exercised to shepherd one another. It is impossible for a few elders to shepherd all the saints in the church. But if the church is divided into group meetings, all the saints will shepherd one another. The group meetings are so easy and so delightful. There is no hardship or any heavy burden on anyone. If someone were charged to be the leader of a group meeting, he would have to prepare a teaching to give, and he would be overburdened. But in the organic way, no one is overburdened. Everyone is ecstatic. When a question is raised, we can all answer, listen, and learn.</P><P>Hebrews 10:24 says that we should incite one another to love and good works. It is by this "free way," the organic way, of having group meetings that we can incite one another. In this way there is no limitation, no assignment, and no designation. The meeting is left open to everyone. All the riches of the attending members will come out in the group meetings, and these are the riches of the Body of Christ.</P>
