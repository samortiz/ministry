   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION FIFTEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MESSAGES AND FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN SHANGHAI IN 1941 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-FOUR GOD'S ETERNAL PLAN Date: 1941</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place: Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3-23 Please pay special attention to vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4-5, 11, 16-19.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>EPHESIANS AND GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians is a book on God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It speaks of God's purpose more than once and covers the lofty and eternal aspects of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter one Paul prayed for the saints to see and know.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter two points out the saints' relationship with the Lord and with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter three Paul prayed for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today we will concentrate on the prayer in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>SEEING AND KNOWING THREE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul prayed for three things in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He prayed that the saints would see and know God's calling, His inheritance in the saints, and His power toward those who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's eternal plan is related to His calling, His inheritance, and His power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's Calling</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, the saints must see the hope of God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 4 describes this calling: "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has called us to this condition, that is, to be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we compare this picture with the actual situation of Christians today, we can see that there is a great difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's Inheritance in the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second, the saints have to see God's inheritance in them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Concerning His inheritance, verse 5 says that God predestinated us unto sonship and verse 11 says that He predestinated us to be an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's inheritance in the saints is for us to become His inheritance, which is for us to receive the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's plan is related to sons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's predestination has nothing to do with man's salvation or perdition; it has to do with Him having many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Theologians pointlessly argue about predestination unto salvation or predestination unto perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Galatians 4 and Hebrews 2 both speak of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the appointed time God will redeem His people unto sonship, that is, He will receive His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Redemption is a parenthetical move, whereas predestination unto sonship is a matter that occupies an eternal place in God's things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What does it mean to inherit an inheritance?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we inherit an inheritance, it means that someone else's possession becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All fixed assets and other assets become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, we receive an inheritance, which is the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, God receives an inheritance in us, which means that He gains and possesses us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's Power in the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are two parts in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first part was accomplished before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second part was accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's plan was accomplished before the foundation of the world, whereas the problem of man's fall was dealt with by the accomplishment of the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ephesians 1:7 says, "In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's power in the believers is the power which He caused to operate in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This power raised Christ from the dead and seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today this power is operating in the believers for the accomplishment of God's purpose.</S>
