[1]  CONTENTS Keeping Oneness in Love God's Administration Fellowship Concerning Our Going On
[2]  Chapter one was a message given to the saints in the training on July 8 and chapters two and three were fellowship with the elders on July 9.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE KEEPING ONENESS IN LOVE Scripture Reading: Eph 4:2-3; Rom 14:1-3, 5-6; Phil 2:2-3; 1 Cor 11:27-29
[4]  PRACTICING ROMANS 14 TO HAVE THE REALITY OF THE BODY LIFE IN ROMANS 12
[5]  At the beginning of my ministry in the United States in 1962, I spoke frequently on Romans 12.
[6]  First, you have to present your body to the Lord v. 1 , then your mind will be renewed v. 2 , and your spirit will be burning v. 11 . With our body presented, our mind renewed, and our spirit burning, we can know the will of God v. 2 , which is to live the Body life.
[7]  If we are going to have the proper Body life, the church life, we must learn how to embrace all the differences between Christians.
[8]  Some of the saints at Paul's time were vegetarians, while others liked to eat meat v. 2 . Some of the saints in the church life wanted to keep certain days as holy days, while others did not v. 5 . Some probably liked to keep the Sabbath, and others felt that every day was the same.
[9]  Suppose that a Seventh Day Adventist came to take the Lord's table, and he sat next to you.
[10]  CONCERNING THE LORD'S TABLE Proving Ourselves to Partake of the Table
[11]  First Corinthians 11:27-29 says, "So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.
[12]  Now that we have seen the crucial matter of keeping oneness in love, we want to study the Word concerning God's administration on this earth.
[13]  If we are going to see God's administration on this earth, we have to see the administration of the church.
[14]  Among the priests was the high priest with his priestly garments.
[15]  GOD'S ADMINISTRATION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT The Elders Appointed by the Apostles
[16]  These verses show us that the elders were properly produced in the New Testament through appointment by those who preached the gospel to them, who taught them the truth, and who formed them with the saints into a local church.
[17]  Paul, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, made this matter of God's administration in the New Testament very clear.
[18]  He charged the brothers in Corinth to remove a certain sinful man from the fellowship of the church 5:13 , which is also the fellowship of the apostles and of the saints.
[19]  His desire was that this evil person would be removed from the church, but he would not do it by himself because he was not the direct administrator.
[20]  By the New Testament teaching and example, we can realize that some elders had been established in the church in Corinth.
[21]  Besides the elders as the priests and as the administrators, there are the prophets and teachers as illustrated in Acts 13:1-4.
[22]  The apostles' hands should be off of the church in its administration, but this does not mean that the apostles have absolutely nothing to do with a local church after its elders have been established.
[23]  Based upon Paul's word to Timothy in this matter, how can we say that the apostles, who appointed the elders and handed over the church to them, have nothing to do with the church or the elders once they have been established?
[24]  The Churches Being Local in Administration but Not Absolutely Independent
[25]  There is another important item from the Word that we have to realize.
[26]  In 1 Corinthians 4:17, Paul says, "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church."
[27]  Now that we have seen something concerning God's administration in chapter two, I want to have more fellowship concerning our going on.
[28]  I must obey my Lord who sent me, who charged me, and who gave me this commission to help His recovery, who gave me this burden of the ministry of His word to release His word.
[29]  I have a burden to stay in one place for at least nine months out of the year in order to directly help build up the local church there with some elders.
[30]  In 1922 Brother Nee raised up a local church in his city.
[31]  Sixty-six years have passed and we have not seen a model of a local church built up entirely according to what we have seen from the Lord.
[32]  Because I was so busy training the saints, I did not have the opportunity to build up a local church according to what I teach and according to what I have seen of the Lord.
[33]  Question: Many times you reach a point in your experience where you have genuine concerns.
[34]  If I see something in you that would not be so good for the recovery, I must pray for you and seek the Lord's leading to go to you and open up the matters of concern.
[35]  I should be able to do this without any kind of fear because we are brothers in the recovery, and we can fellowship about these things.
[36]  Before we go to see him, we should not say anything to anyone because this kind of "pre-talk" opens the door for the devil to come in. If I have seen something about you that is not so fitting in the Lord's recovery, I should not talk about this to anyone.
[37]  I hope that all of us would practice this principle.
[38]  If we have a real concern about a certain matter involving a certain person, we should firstly pray.
[39]  If we realize that the by-product, the result, of our touching this matter will not be profitable, then we should exercise our wisdom not to touch it.
[40]  Question: When the leading brothers come together to pray for the church, am I understanding correctly that you do not bring up any of the problems that you see in the saints?
