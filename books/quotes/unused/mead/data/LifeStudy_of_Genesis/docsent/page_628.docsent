   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c Positioned in Heaven, but Living on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although God's people are positioned in heaven as the sun, the moon, and the stars, they are living on earth as sheaves Phil 3:20; 2:15 , for sheaves grow in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today we are the heavenly people living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have been encouraged, strengthened, and edified by this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have complete faith in you all, and I expect to see you all in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I like to have an eternal view, not the view from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not want to view things according to my limited sight.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, I would use the divine telescope.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you say that the brothers and sisters are so bad, it means that you are extremely shortsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if you use the divine telescope to see through time, you will behold the New Jerusalem where there is nothing but sheaves and stars.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Jerusalem there are no "gophers" or "scorpions."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There, everything is full of life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we consider Joseph's dreams, we realize that no human mind could have conceived the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only God could have caused Joseph to have these dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>d Actually Being Sinful</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although Joseph saw these two dreams, he still suffered the hatred and conspiracy of his brothers in that very chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, in the following chapter we see Judah's lust.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that actually the sons of Jacob were evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, in the heavenly view they were not evil; they were sheaves full of life and stars full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason these two chapters are put together is so that we may have a contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In God's view the sons of Jacob are bright, but actually they are dark.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In actuality they were sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now we can understand why chapter thirty-eight follows chapter thirty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>e Christ Still Coming through Them</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the sons of Jacob were sinful, Christ still came through them 38:27-30; Matt 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Out of the gross sin committed in chapter thirty-eight, two sons were born, the first of whom was a forefather of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Pharez, mentioned in the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1, was one of Christ's forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the holy word of Scripture, Christ came through the sinful sons of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is similar to David's sin with Bathsheba.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The issue of that sin was Solomon, who was also a forefather of Christ, one through whom Christ came Matt 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not believe that the church is not good, and do not complain against the saints or say that they are "scorpions."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Out of a seemingly hopeless church, full of saints who, in your eyes, are "scorpions," Christ will come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, this does not mean that we should do evil that good may come.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, it is a testimony of God's sovereign grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether the believers are good or bad, we must be careful not to speak against them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do, God will say, "I do not see any iniquity or perverseness among them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>My Christ will come through them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Don't you condemn them."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all need such a heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The mature life has a reigning aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more mature in life you become, the less you will speak negatively concerning the saints or the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we came into the church, we had a church-life honeymoon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The honeymoon, however, never lasts very long.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After your church-life honeymoon has ended, you may say, "I thought the church would be so good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But actually it is not good at all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I could find something better, I would certainly not stay here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But, sorry to say, I cannot find anything better.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, I'm still looking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I may even go somewhere to start something on my own.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Regardless of what I do, the church here is certainly not very good."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whenever you speak like this, you will suffer death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But one day the heavenly dream will come, and your view will be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You will realize that you dare not say anything negative concerning the church or the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the contrary, you will say, "This is the church, and this is God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In God's eyes the believers are all sheaves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are also the sun, the moon, and the stars."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you come to this stage, you will not dare to say anything negative about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After seeing such a vision, I have nevertheless said at times, "Yes, I have seen that the church is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But actually it is not so."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In saying this, the "tail" was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even this "tail" caused me to suffer death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Eventually, I was completely subdued and convinced, and I said, "Lord, I forget my short sight and use the divine telescope.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church is excellent, marvelous, and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is nothing wrong with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is perfect and complete."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When I speak like this, I am full of life and I enjoy life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To me, every brother and sister is wonderful, and I love them all, including the backsliders.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more I speak this way about the brothers and sisters, the more I am full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I believe many of us have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are not the ones to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God is the Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>And He is not judging the saints; He is working on them to transform the "scorpions" into sheaves and the "gophers" into stars.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Eventually, we all shall be sheaves and stars.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May we all have this eternal view.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>6 His People to Be under His Reign</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Eventually, all Joseph's people will be under his reign 37:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Joseph signifies the reigning aspect of the mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only the mature life can reign, just as Christ reigns over the Jews Matt 27:11; John 19:19 .</S>
