   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Four The Vision of Christ in Glory Scripture Reading: Isa 6:1-8; John 12:38-41 In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple Isa 6:1: The One who was seen by Isaiah was Christ as the Lord, the King, Jehovah of hosts v. 5b: John, in his account of Christ s living and working on earth, said that Isaiah saw His glory and spoke concerning Him John 12:41.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to see the vision of the glorious enthroned Christ, we need to take heed to Isaiah s warning word Isa 6:9-10 by exercising our spirit to pray that the Lord would open our inner eyes, soften our heart, and keep our heart turned to Him so that we may receive His inner healing of our blindness and sickness John 12:38-40; Matt 13:14-17; Acts 28:25-27; Rev 3:18; 4:2; 2 Cor 3:16-18 .</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the unique good thing in the universe; we must look at Him with undivided attention by turning away from every other object; we should not look at anything or anyone other than Christ Heb 12:1-2a.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On this earth everything changes and fluctuates, but Christ remains the same today and forever; hence, we should not look down at the situation on earth but should look up to Christ on the throne v. 2; 13:8.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ s long robe signifies His splendor in His virtues, expressed mainly in and through His humanity; that Christ was wearing a long robe indicates that He appeared to Isaiah in the image of a man; Christ is the enthroned God-man with the divine glory expressed in His human virtues Isa 6:1; cf.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A great percentage of the words that we speak are evil because most of the words are words of criticism; if we eliminate gossip, murmuring, and reasoning, we may find that we have very little to talk about Phil 2:12-14; cf.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Isaiah was purged with an ember from the altar; the application of this ember by the seraphim signifies the effectiveness of Christ s redemption accomplished on the cross and applied by the Spirit, the Holy in His judging, burning, and sanctifying power vv.</S>
