   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dan 2:28; 9:24-27 The two Epistles to the Thessalonians were written in the light of the Lord s coming; the Lord s coming Gk. parousia is His presence: Every chapter of 1 Thessalonians ends with the coming of the Lord; this shows that the writer, Paul, lived and worked with the Lord s coming before him, taking it as an attraction, an incentive, a goal, and a warning 1:10; 2:19; 3:13; 4:15-18; 5:23.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because we are awaiting the Son of God from the heavens, our future is focused on Him; our life declares that we have no hope on this earth and no positive destiny in this age, and that our hope is the coming Lord, who is our destiny forever; this governs, holds, and keeps our Christian life for the church life 1:10; 2 Thes 2:1, 8.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see the coming presence Gk. parousia of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him vv.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the end of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, the second half of the last week in Daniel 9:27, the majority of the believers, both the dead and resurrected and the living, will be raptured into Christ s presence parousia in the air; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 speaks of this rapture, which corresponds to the reaping of the harvest in Revelation 14:14-16.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The prophecy of the seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24-27 shows that the day of the Lord s coming is very near; the seventy weeks are divided into three parts, each week being seven years in length cf.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Third, the last week of seven years will be for Antichrist to make a firm covenant with the people of Israel v. 27 ; in the middle of that week he will break the covenant, terminate Israel s sacrifices and oblations to God, and persecute those who fear God v. 27; Rev 13 ; this will be the beginning of the great tribulation, which will last for three and a half years: When there is news that such a strong man signs a treaty of seven years with Israel, we have to prepare ourselves to be raptured Matt 24:32-44.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the beginning of the great tribulation, Antichrist s image will be set up in the temple as an idol, and he will sit in the temple of God, exalting himself above every object of worship; this means that the temple must be rebuilt before the great tribulation begins vv.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a gap of unknown duration between the first sixty-nine weeks and the last week of the seventy weeks; this gap is the age of mystery, the age of grace, the age of the church Eph 3:3-11; 5:32; Col 1:27: During this age Christ is secretly and mysteriously building up the church in the new creation to be His Body and His bride Eph 5:25-32.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the end of the last week of the seventy weeks, Christ with His overcomers, His bridal army, will come as the smiting stone to crush the totality of human government and become a great mountain, the kingdom of God, that fills the whole earth Dan 2:34-35; 2 Thes 2:8; Rev 19:19-20.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord will come secretly as a thief to those who love Him and will steal them away as His treasures to bring them into His presence in the heavens; hence, we must watch and make ourselves ready to be His bride Dan 10:19; Matt 24:42-44; 25:13; Rev 19:7; 22:20: Every day that we have is truly the Lord s grace; therefore, as long as we have today, as long as we still have breath, we must love the Lord and His appearing, await the Lord s coming, and always take His coming as an encouragement 1 Thes 5:1-11; 2 Tim 4:1, 6-8; Luke 12:16-20.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must persevere in prayer to glorify God, thank God, worship God, and serve God; our prayer and our being should be totally for God s interests Dan 6:10; 9:17; 1 Kings 8:48; cf.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must be watchful, on the alert, for our prayer life, cooperating with the indwelling, sanctifying Spirit to live a rejoicing, praying, and thanking life as a glory to God and a shame to His enemy Matt 25:13; Col 4:2; 1 Thes 5:16-18.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must not beat our fellow slaves, eat and drink with the drunken, or bury the Lord s gift; instead, we must feed God s children, spreading the truth of the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth Matt 24:14, 45-51; 25:25.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must keep the word of the Lord s endurance, standing against the wearing-out tactics of Satan, and live, walk, and work by faith and love in the hope of the Lord s coming back Rev 3:10; Dan 7:25; 1 Thes 1:3.</S>
