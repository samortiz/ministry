   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord's Progressive Leading Guling, Jiujiang</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You have no way of knowing our situation because communication is so difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We would like to tell you how the Lord has progressively led us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We resumed meetings in July and August of 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time, Brother Rao Jun-ren and Brother Huang Deh-en from Nanchang and Brother Hsu Xu-guo from Nanking were all here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A newly saved brother, Wei Yan-bin, who was bearing responsibility with them, was also with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Wei returned to Shanghai long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By the Lord's arrangement we borrowed a hall at 15 He-Dong Road because of the needs of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Beginning in July, we began paying rent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the rent is not much, it makes our ground more solid.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By the Lord's grace, we are learning to serve Him step by step and have been continually kept in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although we are in an isolated spot, the Lord has helped us to learn to trust Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The number in the meetings here varies according to the season and the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the most we have around fifty or sixty, and at a minimum we have more than ten.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The number of those who regularly attend the meetings is around thirty or forty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are about ten men and twenty women.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Five brothers and sisters were baptized on June 11.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the beginning we only had meetings on the Lord's Day, but later we added the prayer service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Presently, we have four meetings a week: a message meeting on the Lord's Day morning at 9:00 we preach the gospel on the first Lord's Day of every month , the Lord's table meeting at 11:00, a fellowship and Bible study meeting on Wednesday at Brother Hsu's home, and a prayer and Bible study meeting on Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have a children's meeting every Lord's Day afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are almost one hundred children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Three young sisters bear the responsibility for this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We really need the supply for the children's meeting and the edification of a new believers' meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Please remember us much before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The brothers in Guling,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Xiong Cheng-en, Yu Xin-liang, Hsu Xu-guo</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>July 28</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mailing Address: Wenhua House, Hsin 121 Bo-shu Road, Guling, Jiujiang</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Repeated Cries</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Wanxian, Szechuan Province</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We recently read Brother Kuo Ben-biao's letter from Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He met a certain Brother Ma Cheng-yen of Shanghai in Hankow who had gone to Chungking as a pioneer for groups migrating to Szechuan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to his letter, two hundred thirty brothers and sisters in Shanghai have signed up for migration for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We were overjoyed when we heard this news.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We saw that there is not only the need in the remote places but also the response in the coastal centers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we feel that we should bring our pressing needs to your attention at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we left Shanghai last spring, we remembered that Brother Witness Lee said in a meeting something to the effect that our returning to Szechuan might be for later migrations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We did not have such foresight then, but we really do have a heavy burden for the work in Szechuan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have been here for more than a year and have written to tell you about the condition of our gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We already have begun the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen the Lord's support and blessing amidst all our weakness, immaturity, and pitifulness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have given Brother Hsu Jung-jieh in Chungking detailed reports of the situation in Wanxian and have asked him frequently for advice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We recently received a letter from Brother Hsu saying that if the Lord allows, Sister Sia Xiu-lian may come to Wanxian to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We held our first baptism meeting last Lord's Day June 18 and baptized a total of twenty-one brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord was really with us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>With regard to brothers and sisters from Shanghai migrating to Wanxian, we have found a place that can accommodate from twenty to one hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the brothers arrive, there will be no problem finding them a place to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Regarding the problem of the brothers' occupations after coming to Wanxian, we have made the following preliminary investigations: 1 Farming.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have asked if fields would be available after the harvest next fall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the brothers coming to Wanxian want to farm unused land, they will not be able to make a living, because there is not much unused land, and what there is is too difficult to till.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the brothers decide to farm here, we will do our best to find a way and tell you in another letter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>2 Industrial production would be easier to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is a very good building not far from the city that can hold over a hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is excellent for a factory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the brothers can bring some means of production, and if they are able to engage in such work, this place can be a good production base for Wanxian.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is merely a suggestion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>With regard to the details of the matter, you will need to make decisions about how many brothers and sisters are coming to Wanxian and what kind of product would be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you have any questions, please write us, and we will carry out your instructions and decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This letter is merely to give you an introduction to our needs and the situation here for your consideration and decision.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In conclusion, we are issuing a repeated call, and we ask that you not ignore it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In any event, you must remember this lonely, weak, and pitiful flock of sheep in a remote mountain corner.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Finally, we ask that you answer our letter, lest we worry!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Oh, we rejoice so much when we receive a letter, a magazine, or a book from the brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Chen Fa-guang, Chen Liu Shi-feng</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>June 23, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Mailing Address: 120 Huan Cheng Road, Wanxian, Szechuan</S>
