   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Speaking the Word of Wisdom and of Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and the Prophetic Word</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 12 shows us that speaking the word of wisdom and of knowledge and the prophetic word are the result and the manifestation of the infilling Spirit 1 Cor 12:7-8, 10 and notes 8 1 and 10 2 in the Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word of wisdom is deeper than the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is mainly of our spirit through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the one who is filled with the Spirit inwardly, this revelation becomes an utterance, which is the word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word of knowledge is mainly of our understanding through teaching, yet even this word from the mind is inspired; it is something that comes out of the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word of knowledge helps the saints to know the heavenly, spiritual, and divine things, and is mainly concerning Christ as the mystery of God Col 2:2 and the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapters twelve through fourteen of 1 Corinthians are very much related to Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 12:12 says, For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 13 continues, For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The one Body is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two verses concerning the Body and concerning Christ, the Head of the Body, are the governing verses for chapters twelve through fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is covered in these chapters is altogether related to Christ as the Head and the church as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is unfortunate that many readers of these chapters have never considered that they are concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most readers consider that these chapters merely deal with problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One exposition of 1 Corinthians written among the Brethren points out that this book deals with eleven major problems in the church in Corinth, but it does not speak much concerning Christ and Christ crucified 1 Cor 2:2 and the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we get into the depths of chapters twelve through fourteen, we will see that they deal with the things concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the one hand, there is the need for the word of wisdom to reveal these things to us, and on the other hand, there is the need for the word of knowledge to teach us these things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I believe that this is exactly what we are doing now in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Quite often we have the word of wisdom, and even more we have the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The prophetic word is the word directly inspired by the Spirit for speaking for God and speaking forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may receive a word through the inspiration of the infilling Spirit to speak Christ or to speak forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word of prophecy also includes foretelling, prediction, to tell things before they happen.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, prophecy is not used much in this sense in the New Testament, particularly in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 the word prophecy refers not mainly to prediction but to speaking Christ and speaking forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To speak Christ and speak forth Christ is the proper prophesying, the prophetic word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not the ordinary word of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is something very divine, coming from the direct inspiration of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word of prophecy is a strong sign that the speaker is filled with the essential Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Living by the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>and Walking according to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The result and manifestation of the infilling Spirit includes living by the Spirit and walking according to the spirit Gal 5:16, 25; Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Galatians 5:25 living by the Spirit differs from walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We Christians are not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As human beings, we have three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Sometimes we live by our soul, and sometimes it seems that we are just living by our body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although we cannot live without the soul, a person may sometimes live as if he only had a body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only does such a one live without his spirit, it seems that he is living even without his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He does not care about politics, education, or ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He just lives to eat, drink, and have a good time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There may also be a person who lives neither in his spirit nor for his body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This kind of person is very strong in his soul and may be a professor with a Ph.D. in psychology or philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a one will always lead you into the forest of his thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After talking to him for ten minutes, you will be lost and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not want to be persons who live by our body or soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should be persons living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we live in the spirit, we are filled with joy, and we speak the word of praise, the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, and the prophetic word, full of teaching and full of exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If anyone is to exhort, he must be sober in his mind, his thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet he can speak out from his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Walking in the spirit is more than living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To walk is to take action.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you take any action, you cannot avoid walking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to Galatians 5:16 and 25, there are two kinds of walk in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first is the walk in our ordinary living referred to in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We still have to maintain a job, to be educated, and to care for our house and our children.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the walk of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, we also need another kind of walk referred to in verse 25, a walk in a regulated line with a definite goal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This may be illustrated by the life of a proper student in college.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the same time every morning this student must rise up and drive to school.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the afternoon he returns home, eats, and does his homework.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This illustrates the second walk, not the ordinary walk of daily life, but a walk with a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You must walk in the regulated way in order to reach a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all must have these two kinds of walks in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must walk daily and regularly for our living, family, housing, and transportation, and we must also walk with a certain direction day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These two kinds of walks are also signs that we are filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today many do not live by walking properly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They have no goal; they walk irregularly and in an unregulated way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we would walk by the Spirit in the way of the ordinary daily life and also in a regulated way with a certain goal, this would be a strong sign that we are persons filled inwardly with the Spirit.</S>
