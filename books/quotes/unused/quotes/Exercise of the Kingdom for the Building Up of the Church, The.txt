They replied, 'Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets'
According to the Old Testament principle, anyone used by God to carry out His administration had to be anointed
Christ is the anointed One, the One upon whom God has poured Himself out as the ointment to accomplish His administration
The difference between these two symbols of the Spirit is that the Spirit as water is for life, whereas the Spirit as oil is for function
The Spirit came not as water, but as oil, because Christ was the anointed One of God for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
The Lord said to Peter You are blessed Simon Barjona because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but My Father Who is in the heavens
We need to look to the Father in heaven to grant us to see that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God
Because God's element, essence, life, and nature are embodied in the Son, the Son is the substance, the expression, of the divine life
Corinthians 1:21 says, 'Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed One, and has anointed us, is God'
Through this revelation, Peter was transformed from Simon to Peter, from a son of Jonah to a son of the Father in the heavens
Many Christians in Catholicism or in the denominations are familiar with the verse about Christ building His church upon this rock
It was at the juncture of confessing that Jesus was the Christ and the Son of God, that Simon was changed to Peter
According to Matthew 16, to be built upon this rock is to see the Person, to receive the revelation, and to make the declaration
The rock being cleft signifies Christ crucified, and the flowing of living water signifies Christ flowing through resurrection
Day by day we are drinking the water flowing out of the cleft rock, and we are also being attached to the anointed One
We all need to see a vision of the Person of Christ and then declare what we see, saying, 'Amen, this is Christ, the Son of the living God'
The last Adam was the cleft rock and the lifegiving Spirit is the living water flowing in His resurrection flowing in the resurrected Christ
By drinking of the cleft and resurrected Christ, we receive the flowing water that enables us to grow and be built up
If we declare that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God, we shall be filled with water and covered with oil
By life and function we shall become the corporate Christ, the one Body with the many members to fulfill God's purpose
He came firstly not to express what God is, but to accomplish what God wanted Him to do for the fulfillment of His purpose
For this reason, in Matthew 16:16 Peter said that Jesus was the Christ, and then went on to say that He was also the Son of the living God
Before we consider the function of the anointed One, we need to see that the Son of the living God is the embodiment of what God is
Perhaps you have never before realized that when the anointed One was crucified on the cross, He was carrying out His function
The anointed One functioned by being crucified, resurrecting, and ascending, all that the Son might be imparted into us as life
Through the function of the anointed One, the Son of the living God has been imparted into us, and we have life
On that day, the anointed One of God functioned through His crucifixion and resurrection to impart Himself as the Son of God into Peter
On the day of resurrection, Peter received the Son of God as life; on the day of Pentecost, he gained Christ for function
Remember, on the day of resurrection, Simon Bar-jona, the son of a natural man, was constituted with the Son of the living God
On the day of resurrection, the Son of God was wrought into him, and on the day of Pentecost the Christ was poured out upon him
The church is a group of sons of flesh and blood who have been constituted with the Son of God within and with the Christ without
As we have seen, all that God is, is embodied in the Son and all that God does is related to Christ, the anointed One
We are also attached to Christ, the anointed One, and become part of the corporate Christ, the Body, the church
When we are Peters, not Simons, and are constituted with the Son of God and the Christ, we are no longer Satan's food
When He was transfigured and entered into another realm, the realm of transfiguration, that realm became the kingdom
When we are transformed into Peters, we have the keys of the kingdom, which were given not to Simon, but to Peter
The keys of the kingdom were not given to the natural man, but to one who had been reconstituted and transformed
Apart from the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, it is impossible for any son of Jonah to be reconstituted
When the Lord appeared to His disciples on the day of His resurrection, the mark of the cleft was still visible in His side
By continuing to drink of Him we were solidly founded upon the rock, which is the crucified and resurrected Christ
Today nearly all Christians know that Christ is the rock upon which the church is built and that He is the foundation of the church
Being founded on the rock is not merely a matter of becoming a Christian and then coming together with other Christians
When this is our condition, we are not only the church on the defensive, but also the kingdom on the offensive
If you are a Peter, then one day you saw the Christ, the Son of the living God, and you reacted to what you saw
All these sons of Jonah have been reconstituted to become not only the church on the defensive, but also the kingdom on the offensive
In order to interpret the Bible, we must follow the basic principle of taking care of the context of every verse
In Matthew 16, Christ, the Son of the living God, the church, the kingdom, the gates of Hades, and the keys of the kingdom are all revealed
It was through the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ that Simon, the son of Jonah, became Peter, a son of God
Verse 22 says And Peter taking Him to him began to rebuke Him saying God be merciful to You Lord this shall by no means happen to You!
For whoever desires to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
If anyone desires to come after Him that is take Him as the pattern and the pathway he must deny himself take up his cross and follow Him
In addition to the self verses 21 through 26 also speak of the mind and the soul both of which are also gates through which Satan comes out
Throughout history, the church has not been damaged mainly by Judaism or Gnosticism; it has been damaged mainly by the self
Martin Luther once said that although he was afraid of the pope, he was more afraid of the stronger pope, the self, within his own heart
In 1948 there was a certain brother in Shanghai who was full of self and whose soul was an open gate that no one could lock
A short while later, he stopped coming to the church meetings, began a meeting in his home, and hired a traveling preacher
With the financial support of this dissenting brother, this preacher wrote a long article opposing Brother Nee
As we have seen, Matthew 16 speaks about the building up of the church and also about the gates of Hades and the keys of the kingdom
Among the brothers and sisters in the church, there should be a pure divine love, but there should not be any personal affection
We need to receive the mercy of the Lord to regard all the saints as our brothers and sisters, but none as our friends
Whenever you discover that you are feeding a brother's self and that he is feeding yours, you must use the key to lock the gate of the self
Peter had a good heart, but within him there was the hidden self that became the gateway for Satan to come out
Verse 24 says, 'If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me'
If the Lord had not denied Himself and gone to the cross, He could not have been resurrected, and there would have been no church
We see that Paul desired to know three things: Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings
Now the Lord has given us further understanding to see how the church can be built up through the exercise of the keys
Whether the brothers love you and welcome you or hate you and do not welcome you, you still need to lock your self
Verse 22 says And Peter taking Him to him began to rebuke Him saying God be merciful to You Lord this shall by no means happen to You!
You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
Verse 24 says Then Jesus said to His disciples If anyone desires to come after Me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
In order for the church to be built, the Lord Jesus had to take up His cross, and we also must take up our cross
The Lord was willing to take up the cross, to go to the cross, and to remain on the cross until God's will had been fulfilled
Although we have the divine life within us and have become members of the church, the problem is whether or not we shall be built up
Throughout the centuries, Christians have had the divine life in them for the church, but there has not been the building
He may either suffer with her like a criminal being executed on the cross, or he may take her as God's will and as his lot and portion
Although being in the church may cause us difficulties, there is nothing we can do about it, for the church is the church
Nearly all Christians today choose a church according to their taste, like people who choose restaurants according to their taste
Others prefer a church where they can speak in tongues or hear musical performances by soloists, quartets, and choirs
Whether we like the church or not, we must recognize the church is not according to our taste, but according to God's will and ordination
If we receive mercy and grace from the Lord, we shall become a happy bearer of the cross, not a criminal condemned to execution
The church has not been built over the past nineteen centuries because not many have been willing to take up the cross
After staying in a certain place for a period of time, they became unhappy with the church there, especially with the leading ones
What a shame it is if we talk about the building, but do not actually have the building because of our natural preferences!
We are here as the testimony of the building, and we want there to be no ground for the demons and evil angels to say anything'
We must have no preferences, no choices except the will of God; and we must take up the cross, that is, take up the will of God
Because of this, many have been veiled from seeing the fact that verses 21 through 28 disclose the way to build the church
Years ago we saw the revelation concerning Christ and the church and the prophecy that Christ would build His church
Verse 25 says, 'For whoever desires to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
Luke 9:25 says, 'For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away'?
According to the context of Matthew 16, the self in verse 24 is the embodiment and expression of the soul in verse 25
If you consider the context of verses 25 through 27, you will see that the Lord is speaking about the enjoyment of the soul
To lose the soul means to lose the enjoyment of the soul, and to gain the soul means to have the enjoyment of the soul
As tripartite men, we have three kinds of enjoyment: physical enjoyment, spiritual enjoyment, and psychological enjoyment
According to the New Testament, both the physical enjoyment and the spiritual enjoyment are for the soulish enjoyment
In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus said that if we would take His yoke upon us and learn of Him, we would find rest to our souls
Those who attend nightclubs may be satisfied in a fleshly, soulish way, but they do not have the support of spiritual satisfaction
The rest we enjoy in our soul is lasting because it has the support of the rest in the spirit, the support of spiritual satisfaction
The physical enjoyment is for the soulish enjoyment, and the spiritual enjoyment supports the soulish enjoyment
The Lord said that whoever desires to save his soul will lose it, and that whoever loses his soul for His sake will find it
Suppose the brothers living in a brothers' house have seen the vision concerning Christ and the building of the church
One brother may actually move from that house to another house, where, after a few weeks, he learns that the situation is the same
He moves to a church in another part of the country, concealing the reason for his move under the cloak of seeking a better church life
When he arrives in the new locality and moves into a brothers' house there, he finds the situation even worse than the one he left
If you feel sorry for yourself because you are the only one to wash the dishes, the gate will be opened for Satan to come forth
If someone offends you, you may be unwilling to forgive him simply because you enjoy being able to condemn him
If you are willing to lose your soulish enjoyment, you will be rewarded one day when the Lord comes into your family
You were willing to lose it, but when the Lord comes in, He will save it and cause you to have great enjoyment
If you are willing to lose your soul in a practical way, others will be nourished by you and built up through you
As you are washing dishes in the brothers' house, you will be happy and willing to lose your soulish enjoyment to satisfy others
We need to lose all our present soulish enjoyment for the Lord's sake, for the sake of the church, and for the sake of all the saints
If you are willing to lose your soul for the sake of others, those with you will be enlightened, nourished, and filled
For us the church life will be darkness, and, during the time of transfiguration, we shall be rewarded with suffering
If we had insisted that this brother go in a certain direction, it would have meant that we were not denying ourselves
If a brother loses his soul by losing the case to his wife, the Lord will reward him by coming in at a certain point to save his soul
The Lord Jesus will reward you in a positive way when He causes a transfiguration to take place in your family
Not many Christians have a clear understanding of the salvation of the soul or of the verses that refer to this matter
When we believed in the Lord Jesus and were washed in His blood, we were regenerated by the Holy Spirit and saved
Just as God created the stomach to receive and digest food, so He created our spirit to contact, receive, and even digest God
When the Lord Jesus, God incarnate, came, He said that He was the bread of life and that whoever ate Him would live by Him
The fact that the Lord Jesus likened Himself to the food supply, the bread of life, indicates that we need to eat Him and digest Him
God created us with a spirit as the organ to receive Him and digest Him, that is, to take Him as our life supply
If He would remain in heaven and not get into us and be wrought into our being, He could not be expressed through us
For us to receive God, we need a spirit; and for us to live Him out and express Him, we need a personality, which is our soul
Some may think that those who are strong can express God, but that those who are not so strong cannot express Him
God created us with a spirit to take Him in, a soul to express Him, and a body to contain ourselves in a normal way
In Genesis 3 the tempter came in to stir up the enjoyment of the soul, tempting Eve with the fruit that would make her like God
Man's first sin was not adultery, stealing, or murder; it was taking something according to his own preference
To take fruit was not wrong, but to take fruit according to the preference of the soul was the activity of the self
We have been called we have repented we have believed in the Lord Jesus we have been cleansed and the Spirit of God has come into our spirit
Paul delivered him over to Satan that his flesh might be destroyed , but that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus
By confessing our sins, believing in the Lord Jesus, and calling on His name, we are regenerated and have salvation in our spirit
Because people have lost God, they seek entertainment by going to the movies, theater, and various sporting events
Anyone who has been regenerated in his spirit but still plays Mah-Jongg will eventually lose his soul at the Lord's coming
For the Lords sake for the gospels sake and for His testimonys sake we need to be willing to lose the enjoyment of the soul in this age
We need to be those who care for the Lord's pleasure and satisfaction, and we all must believe the Lord's word
He not only tells us that if we believe in Him, our sins will be forgiven, we shall be cleansed, and we shall have eternal life
As long as we have what is necessary for our existence- food, clothing, lodging, and transportation-we should be content
Of giving your brother the money the Lord tells you to give, you may reason with the Lord about it, trying to lower the amount
Will you save your soul by buying an expensive suit, or will you lose it by buying one that is adequate but much less expensive?
The word we have heard in the Bible or in messages will be implanted within us and work for the transformation of our soul
As we lose our soul in all sorts of situations, the word will be implanted into our being to transform our soul
Peter 1:11 says, 'For so an entrance shall be supplied unto you richly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ'
When verse 18 is put with verse 16, we have the complete revelation: Christ and the church, the great mystery of God
Peter's revelation and the acknowledgment of that revelation are the rock upon which the Lord will build His church
The church is the goal, and the Christ revealed and acknowledged by the disciples is the material with which the church is built
If you consider the history of Christianity, you will realize that the enemy has frustrated the believers from Christ and the kingdom
As we have seen, for the building of the church we need Christ, because Christ is the material for the building
Fifty years ago, many articles spoke of the kingdom, and those involved in evangelical work even spoke of spreading the kingdom
If you carefully read the New Testament regarding the kingdom, you will see that today the kingdom is an exercise to us
Verse 10 says, 'Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens'
Whenever we are willing to lose the enjoyment of the soul today for the sake of righteousness we are in the kingdom and the kingdom is ours
If we suffer for the sake of the kingdom, if we are willing to lose our soulish enjoyment today, we are in the kingdom
Where can you find a place where people always have the attitude that they are nothing and have nothing and that they are empty vessels?
If we cannot find people with such an attitude in the church, then there is a question whether that really is the church
His way is not to enlarge the eye of the needle and make it a wide gate so that even a heavily laden camel can get through
Rather, His way is to reduce the size of the camel until it is thin enough to pass through the eye of the needle
After Paul tells us that we need to let the mind of Christ become ours he speaks of how the Lord Jesus was willing to become small and lowly
He pointed out that although Christ was so high and great, He was willing to become lowly and even to be put to death on the cross
If we are willing to cooperate with Him, He will have the ground and the way to work within us so that we may work out our salvation
These doings are related to three matters: the denying of the self, the taking up of the cross, and the losing of the soul
The question is whether or not we are taking Christ as our supply to deny the self, bear the cross, and lose our soul
Paul realized that although he was preaching the gospel of the kingdom to others, he himself might be disapproved, that is, be cast away
The way Paul was pressing toward the prize was by knowing Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings
Paul realized that Christ had been spun into thin thread, and he wanted to be the same as He, even conformed to His death
No doubt, Paul will be one of the co-kings with Christ, one reigning over the nations during the thousand years
If we exercise ourselves in the kingdom today, the topmost, particular portion of the enjoyment of Christ will be ours
You will desire to deny yourself because the best enjoyment of Christ is in self-denial and in the losing of the soul
Although there are millions of genuinely saved Christians, so many have gone no farther than receiving Christ as their Savior
Although he had experienced Christ to such a degree, he still said that he was stretching forth to gain more of Christ
You have been in the ministry for more than forty-five years, and you have been in the church life for such a long time
Christ is the Triune God processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to be the life-giving Spirit
The reason very few Christians are hungry for Christ is that the gospel of the kingdom has never been preached adequately
We need to warn the believers about being cast into outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
We need to preach the warning gospel of the kingdom to stir up the Christians regarding God's dispensational punishment
The other angle is to tell people how Christ has done everything to save them and that they simply need to receive Him
At that time they will be either rewarded or punished, either brought into the bright enjoyment with Christ or cast into outer darkness
When we have been compelled and encouraged to seek Christ, we shall not be idle regarding Christ, and we shall no longer be indifferent
Because so few Christians are hungry for the subjective Christ, it is impossible for the church to be built up with them
He was utterly hungry for Christ, and he did everything possible to gain Christ, to experience Christ, and to be saturated with Christ
From his experience he could say that it was God who worked within him both the willing and the working of His good pleasure
The requirements of the kingdom's constitution and the exercise of the kingdom reveal what great things Christ's life can accomplish in us
Now, after having been incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended, Christ is the very all-inclusive life-giving Spirit within us
If we are filled, saturated, and permeated with Christ, we shall spontaneously be under the exercise of the kingdom
Paul enjoyed Christ as the life-giving Spirit to the uttermost; he hungered after Him and constantly enjoyed Him
There is only one class of people with whom the church can be built: those who are in the exercise of the kingdom
If we are poor in spirit and are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, the kingdom is ours, and we are in it today
On the one hand, the kingdom is ours, and we are in it already; on the other hand, the kingdom is coming, and we shall enter into it
Whether you will accept it or not, whether you will be hungry for Christ and seek Christ or not, is your responsibility
