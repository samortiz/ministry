   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO BE ONE IN SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Philippians deals very much with the soul of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must strive together with one soul in the faith of the gospel 1:27 ; we must be joined in soul, thinking the one thing 2:2 ; and we must be like-souled, genuinely caring for the things of the Lord 2:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the gospel work, in the fellowship among the believers, and in the Lord s interests, our soul is always a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, it must be transformed, especially in its leading part, the mind Rom 12:2 , that we may be of one soul, joined in soul, and like-souled in the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the book of Philippians the experience of Christ is the key point, and the secret of the experience of Christ is to be one in soul or joined in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to this book, we cannot go on in the experience of Christ unless we are joined in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are one only in spirit but are not joined in soul, we cannot go on in the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is a great difference between being in the soul and being one in soul or joined in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The secret of experiencing Christ is to be one in soul, not to be in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The dissenting ones who are altogether in the soul find it impossible to be one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who exercise their mind, emotion, and will are not one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we would experience Christ, we need to be one with others in the soul; that is, we need to become like-souled with others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we exercise our mind, emotion, and will, we may be very individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if we exercise our spirit to be one in soul, our mind will be sobered, our emotion will be regulated, and our will will be adjusted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then it will be possible for us to be one in soul with other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The extraordinary expression like-souled is used in the Bible only in this one place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The King James Version renders the Greek word as like-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The mind is the leading part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the context, to be like-souled primarily means to be like-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The book of Philippians deals much with the believers mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the beginning of chapter two, Paul tells us to think the same thing and even the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates clearly and strongly that to be like-souled is to be like-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some translations have made a serious mistake in their rendering of the Greek word for like-souled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The New American Standard Version says kindred spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is terrible!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In fact, it is actually a change of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a rendering ignores the crucial difference between spirit and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This same version even goes so far as to use the expression united in spirit in 2:2 instead of joined in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past we have emphasized the fact that to experience Christ we must know our human spirit, for only in the spirit can we experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we must go on to see that to experience Christ we must also be one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Experiencing Christ in our spirit is primarily for our individual, personal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But our personal experience of Christ must issue in a concern for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If our experience of Christ results in a concern for the churches and the saints, it will be impossible for us to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, we shall realize the need to be corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to care for the church, we must be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, the more concern we have for the church, the more problems we shall cause.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One brother will enjoy Christ in the spirit, and this experience will give him a concern for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Another brother will also enjoy Christ in the spirit, but have a different kind of concern for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These different kinds of concern will cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The only way for us to be one in our concern for the church is to be like-souled, to be joined in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me give you an example of the problems caused when the leading ones in a local church are not like-souled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>More than forty years ago, it was necessary for me to visit the church in a certain locality in China to help smooth over the differences among the five elders.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Each of the elders loved the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All of them were intelligent and also frank and straightforward.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, these five brothers experienced the Lord in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, each had a different concern for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a result, when they came together for an elders meeting, they argued.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They did not argue over worldly things, but over the church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every few months I was asked to visit that locality to try to reconcile the brothers and to settle the differences.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, after a short period of time the problem arose again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even though the elders in this church loved the Lord and experienced Christ in the spirit, they were not able to be one in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Problems between husband and wife also arise because the two are not one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In loving the Lord and experiencing Him, they have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The brother experiences Christ in his spirit, and his wife experiences Him in her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, when they talk over certain matters, the husband has one concept, and his wife has another concept.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In other words, the husband and wife each have different souls.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The wife may eventually recognize that her husband is the head and go along with him, but inwardly she still does not agree with his concept.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are not truly like-souled.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What should the elders in a local church do when they find that they are not one in soul?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their relationship to one another is surely different from that between a husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Who among the elders can be regarded as the head to whom the others should submit?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No one is the head.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even though they love the Lord and experience Christ in the spirit, they may not be one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This lack of oneness is a leakage which weakens the eldership in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Perhaps certain of the elders who are more experienced will not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead, they will remain quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This quietness, however, may be political.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Actually they may not be willing to open and express what is in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since the elders are not one in soul, they lack the genuine oneness in the concern for the church and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They find it easy to be one in spirit, but not to be like-souled.</S>
