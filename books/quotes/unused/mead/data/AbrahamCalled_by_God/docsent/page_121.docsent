   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>As we have seen, God's intention is to work Himself into a corporate man that He might have a corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the basic concept of the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God called Abraham with the purpose of working Himself into him, but Abraham had a strong self.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This natural self was the strongest frustration to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The same is true with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's purpose is to work Himself into us to be our life and even to be our living, but our natural self frustrates this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, God must cut us and deal with us that He may get into us to be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God does not need us to love others and to be humble that society might be improved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If God wants a better society, He only needs to say, "Better society," and it will come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He calls things not being as being Rom 4:17 and does not need our help.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God wants to work Himself into us to be our humility and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He wants us to say, "Lord, I am nothing and will not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I just open up to You that You might come in, make Your home in me, live in me, and do everything for me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, You live and I'll enjoy Your living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever You do something in me, I'll say, Praise You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am not the doer; I am an enjoyer, appreciating all You are doing for me.'"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's intention today is to deal with Abraham that Isaac may come.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His intention is to deal with our natural being that we may have the full experience of Himself in Christ wrought into us as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have been experiencing married life for close to fifty years, experiencing much enjoyment and much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before I was married, I truly loved the Lord, and I often told Him how much I loved Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After I was married, I went to the Lord and assured Him, saying, "Lord because I love You, I want to be the best husband."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, I failed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I went to the Lord and confessed all my failures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After experiencing the anointing, I was happy and I made up my mind to try again to be the best husband.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But I failed once more, and this experience of ups and downs was repeated again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later, I even gave a message in which I said, "The Christian life has many nights and mornings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Never be disappointed over your failures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Just wait for several hours and you will be in the morning."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For years and years I went through days and nights, nights and days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day, I received the revelation and said, "Stupid man, who told you to do so?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is here waiting to be your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You must say, Lord, I am nothing and I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if I could do something, it would never be recognized by You.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Come, Lord, and do Your job and be the best husband for me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is Your job, not mine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You charge me, and I return the charge to You and ask You to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lord, You be the best husband and I will praise You for it.'"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever I prayed like this, the Lord always did the best job.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Grace is God working Himself into our being as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The very God today is not only God the Father, but also God the Son and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, God the Spirit is the Spirit of grace Heb 10:29 , and this grace is the grace of life 1 Pet 3:7 , which is "the varied grace" 1 Pet 4:10 , the "all grace" 1 Pet 5:10 , and the "sufficient grace" 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Triune God is such a grace, and this grace is now with our spirit Gal 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Grace is the divine Person of the Triune God as the Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the Spirit of grace indwelling our spirit to be our enjoyment that we may enjoy God as our life and our everything, even as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why every one of Paul's Epistles ends with the words, "Grace be with you."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Grace is not outside of us; it is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whatever we call it, the Spirit of grace or the grace of life, it is something living and divine in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do have such a divine reality, the Triune God Himself, in our spirit as our grace and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When He loves others through us, this love is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When He lives Himself out through us, this living is also our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Day and night we may enjoy His living through us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why then do we suffer?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because the self, the ego, the natural man, is still here and must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Praise Him that no dealing is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every dealing from God is a breaking of our natural man that we may enjoy more of Him as our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, we have Abraham and Isaac; we have the suffering of the loss and the enjoyment of the gain.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This gain is not the gain of outward things; it is the gain of the indwelling One, that is, the Spirit of grace and the grace of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Again I say, whatever God gives as a gift outside of us is, at the most, a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When this gift is wrought into our being, becoming the life element within us, it is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The blessing must become the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the Old Testament, God gave many things to His people as blessings, but all those things were merely outward blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before Christ came, none of those blessings had been wrought into God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ came not only to die on the cross for us, but, after His death, to become the life-giving Spirit to enter into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thus, in the New Testament, we have the terms "in Christ" and "Christ in you."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now He is in us and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whatever God gives us in Christ has been wrought into our being and has become grace, our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now we are not merely under His blessing; we are in His grace and His grace is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What are you enjoying today blessing or grace?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The New Testament never says, "Blessing be with you."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, it says repeatedly, "Grace be with you."</S>
