   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OLD MAN AND THE NEW MAN OF A BELIEVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As believers we all have our old man and also the new man Rom 6:6; Eph 4:22, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also can say that we believers of Christ are both the old man and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Romans 6:6 Paul said that our old man has been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then, in Ephesians 4:22, 24 he said that we need to put off the old man and put on the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a thing has not been thoroughly taught in today's Christianity, but in the Lord's recovery this has been ministered to the saints throughout the past sixty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1924 Brother Nee began to speak concerning the old man and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In his book The Spiritual Man he made this matter more than clear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we check with our experience, we will realize that at times we are the new man, and at other times we are the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we are both the old man and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After our morning revival we are the new man, but a short time later we may be offended by someone and become the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then, after repenting and confessing our failure to obtain the Lord's forgiveness, we become the new man again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of experience is the story of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Christian life is a life in which we are sometimes the old man and at other times the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OUR OLD MAN THE OUTER MAN TO BE CONSUMED, BUT OUR NEW MAN THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>TO BE RENEWED DAY BY DAY</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's economy is to have our old man the outer man consumed and our new man the inner man renewed day by day 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Being consumed is not the same as being killed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A person may be killed instantly, but the consuming of our old man is a long process that requires many years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have been in this process for nearly seventy years; nevertheless, the consuming of my old man has not yet been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every day in the church life we are being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This consuming is our being molded, or conformed, to the death of Christ Phil 3:10c .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In making cakes, dough is put into a mold and pressed into the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way the dough is conformed to the form of the mold.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the mold is in the image of a fish, the dough that is pressed into this mold will be conformed to the shape of a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The death of Christ is our mold, and we are the dough.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since the day we were saved we became the dough.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This dough is made of fine flour from wheat Lev 2:1; John 12:24; 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is the fine flour for us to be made the dough.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has put us all into the mold of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The death to which we are being conformed is not Adam's death but Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The death of Christ is a particular death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Out of millions and even billions of deaths, only Christ's death is a particular death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>From the time that we became dough God put us into this death Rom 6:4 , considering this death as a mold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Day by day and year after year God is molding us to conform us to this death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, we are happy in the recovery and in the church life, but on the other hand, deep within we are suffering here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, we have no way to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every day we are being molded.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we come to the dining table to eat, we may not like the food that has been prepared for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is part of the mold, the mold of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Marriage too is a part of this mold.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Marriage is used very much by the Lord to conform the married ones to the death of Christ.</S>
