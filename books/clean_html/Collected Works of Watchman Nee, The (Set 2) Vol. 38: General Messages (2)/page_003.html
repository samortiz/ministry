<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>But what was tragic was not just the condition of the old prophet but the damage the man of God suffered under the old prophet! The Lord charged the man of God saying, "Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest" (1 Kings 13:9). The man of God remembered this charge and rejected the offer of the king. He also rejected the first invitation of the old prophet. Yet he was deceived when the old prophet said, "I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water" (v. 18). He thought that the old prophet was more experienced than he, and he thought that he should listen to him. He returned with the old prophet and ate bread and drank water in his house. The man of God disobeyed the Lord's charge because of the word of the old prophet, and he was killed by a lion. He was very clear about the Lord's charge but was affected by the words, "I am a prophet also," and he became confused. Here we must learn a grave lesson. Once a servant of the Lord has received a clear commandment from the Lord, he should never listen to an old prophet whose word does not match the Lord's charge.</p><p>Paul's charge to the Galatian believers was along the same principle. "If even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed" (Gal. 1:8). The gospel which Paul preached was not according to man but according to the revelation of Jesus Christ (vv. 11-12). But there was another group of people who tried to change the gospel of Christ. They preached another gospel to the Galatian believers. Paul warned the Galatian believers not to be deceived by them. He saw through the deception of the ones who came as servants of God and who tried to distract others with seemingly spiritual words. He warned the Galatians with severe words. He said, "But if even we..." This means that even if Paul himself went to them and preached a gospel different from what he had been preaching, they should not believe in it; they should only believe in the gospel which came from the revelation of Jesus Christ. They should not put their trust in the name "Paul." If he, Paul, were to preach a gospel different from the one he had received from God, they should not believe in it. Paul knew that many people were easily influenced by names; it was easier for them to believe in man's name than in God's word. Therefore, he took a stand; he spoke on behalf of God's truth. He did not give any ground to man or to himself. He wanted them to follow God's truth completely and not man's name. Paul struggled to defend the truth; he was absolutely for God and not for himself at all. He maintained God's truth, not his own name. The only reason he opposed the deceivers was because they had adulterated the word of God and had led the believers into error. He showed us that we should stand on God's side and choose what words we should receive and what words we should reject. If anyone teaches anything that is contrary to God's truth, we cannot listen to him no matter who he is. Paul said, "But if...an angel out of heaven..." He reminded them that they could not even lightly accept the words of the angels. In 2 Corinthians 11:13-15, when Paul spoke about the false apostles, he said, "For such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if also his ministers transfigure themselves into ministers of righteousness." An "angel of light" comes with a mask of benevolence, and it is easy for a man to drop his guard. The Galatians were deceived after they had heard the gospel of the Lord because these ones claimed that they were also preaching the gospel, and that they were zealous for the law of God. Their words seemed persuasive, and the Galatians who had heard the truth were deceived. These deceivers often creep into the church to damage men's faith and to entice them from the Lord's way. We must guard against them watchfully. They are able to deceive others through their false spirituality and their pretended love for the Lord. They speak about "God's revelations" and "God's will," and they can teach seemingly correct doctrines. They confuse truth with falsehood and easily deceive others. Brothers and sisters, we should have a watchful heart and discerning power; we should be faithful to God's Word and keep the faith that has been once delivered to us. We should reject all the "gospels" of those who adulterate the Lord's word, no matter who they are, and we must ask the Lord to keep us in His truth.</p><p>This old prophet did not have any feeling concerning the great sin that Jeroboam had committed. Yet he cheated others with his title of "prophet." He had lost his fellowship with God, yet he still claimed that "an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord." The failure of the man of God lies in the fact that he did not keep the word which he had received directly from God; he was shaken by the vain name of the old prophet and deceived by his lies; therefore, he fell into tragedy.</p><p>The old prophet was so fallen that he even lied to a man sent from God. When they were sitting together at the feast, the word of the Lord came to the old prophet. Does this mean that he had become spiritual again? No. God was dealing with the man of God who had disobeyed His word. He no longer had any demand on the old prophet; God already had put him aside. After the man of God was killed by the lion, the old prophet buried him in his own grave and charged his sons to bury him next to the man of God when he died. The old prophet believed that the word which the Lord charged the man of God to speak against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places which were in the cities of Samaria would surely come to pass. Yet he himself simply waited to die there!</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should remember a few things from this sober and tragic story. First, once a man has lost his fellowship with God, he becomes old, blind, and stale. Second, even though a man has been used by the Lord, once he departs from God, he must no longer deceive others with his "qualifications." Third, once a man disobeys God's word and stays in a place that he should not stay, spiritual death will result. Fourth, any spiritual utterance must match the word of God. Otherwise, even if the words come from an old prophet or from an angel, one should reject them resolutely.</p>
