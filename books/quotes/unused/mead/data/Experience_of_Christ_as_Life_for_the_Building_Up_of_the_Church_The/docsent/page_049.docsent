   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NUMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>RELATED TO THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to consider the numbers related to the ingredients of the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to typology, all the numbers in the Bible are meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Humanity and Divinity</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Compounded in the Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are four spices, and the number four in the Bible is the number of the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The book of Ezekiel speaks of the four living creatures 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, the number four signifies humanity in God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There were 500 shekels of myrrh, 250 shekels of cinnamon, 250 shekels of calamus, and 500 shekels of cassia in the compound ointment, giving a total of three units of 500 shekels each.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The number three signifies the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From these numbers we can see that both humanity and divinity are compounded in the Spirit of God, the heavenly olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Second of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Split on the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Notice that the second unit of 500 shekels is split in half into two units of 250 shekels each.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This signifies that the Second of the Divine Trinity was split through His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Connection of Christ's Death and Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The two units of 250 shekels each are not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of the Lord's death; the other signifies the precious resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This shows that the Lord's death is incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His resurrection must follow His death and be added to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These two things are not separate but are connected together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Complete, Perfect, Eternal, Divine Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All of these elements are put into one hin of olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This entire hin of olive oil signifies the complete, perfect, eternal, divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit of God is complete and eternally perfect in Himself, but He still needs more ingredients to be consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
