   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S WORKING DURING CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to consider how we can prove that when Christ was suffering death on the cross, God was busy there.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Colossians 2:14 says that when Christ was being crucified on the cross, God was wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, contrary to us, nailing it to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 15 says that He also stripped off the rulers and the authorities and made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When Christ was suffering death on the cross, God was busy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was busy in wiping out the handwriting in ordinances by nailing it to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The handwriting in ordinances refers to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you still love the law, what you love was nailed to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While Christ was suffering in being nailed to the cross, God was also busy nailing the law there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While Christ was being crucified, the evil angels came in to frustrate God, and there was a struggle between them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was a group of evil angels who came to frustrate God from working on the cross, so God stripped them off and made a display of them openly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Stripping off in Colossians 2:15 also means putting off, as the putting off of the old man mentioned in 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the cross God was nailing the law and He was putting off many evil angels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was busy on the cross according to the invisible scene.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the intrinsic significance and understanding of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must have the spiritual eyes, the heavenly view, to see an invisible scene every day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IN THE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we need to ask what was accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to answer this question intrinsically.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, Christ took away the sin of the world for God's eternal redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sin in John 1:29 is a total term, including the sin within in our nature and the sins without in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hebrews 9:26 says that Christ put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself, and then verse 28 says that He was once offered to bear the sins of many.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These verses refer to sin singular and to sins plural .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sin does have these two aspects: the inward aspect, the sin in our nature, and the outward aspect, the sin in our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In our preaching of the gospel, to some extent, we should make this clear to our contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if you think you have no sins in your conduct, you are still sinful because in your nature you have sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sin is a factor of your constitution, your being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your being, your person, has been constituted a sinner with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As an illustration, we call a certain drink orange juice because this juice is constituted with oranges.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The orange is the essence, the nature, of this juice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, we are sinners by constitution, not by transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our constitution we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A newborn babe is a sinner because within him there is the constituting factor, the essence, of sin Psa 51:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sin is the essence of our natural constitution, so we are sinners.</S>
