<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PLANNING FOR THE INCREASE<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 1:3; Rev. 22:2; Eph. 5:15-17</h1>
<p>In John 15:5 the Lord spoke of a law for the increase and propagation of the church, saying, &ldquo;I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo; He is the vine, and we are His branches. He and we are a great vine in the universe. A fruit tree bears fruit according to a law of life; it does not bear fruit because someone prays for three days or because God performs a miracle that results in the sudden appearance of clusters of fruit. Rather, a fruit tree grows leaves at a set time, sprouts buds at a set time, blossoms at a set time, and finally bears fruit at a set time. This is according to a law of life.</p>
<p>Matthew 28:19 speaks of our going and discipling all the nations, Mark 16:15 speaks of our going into all the world and proclaiming the gospel to all the creation, and Luke 24:47 speaks of our proclaiming repentance for forgiveness of sins in His name to all the nations. However, John 15:16 speaks of our going forth and bearing fruit. These charges from the Lord show that leading people to salvation through the preaching of the gospel is not merely an outward activity; it is related also to life, showing that the increase and propagation of the church comes out of the operation of the law of life.</p>
<p>The propagation of humanity is continuous and always increasing. This propagation is according to a law, not according to signs and wonders. Even the birth of the Lord Jesus was not accomplished through signs and wonders. He was not conceived of the Holy Spirit one day and born of Mary the next day. If this had happened, it would have been a miracle. Instead, the Lord was conceived in Mary&rsquo;s womb and born nine months later according to the law of human life in God&rsquo;s creation. Even His growth was based on the law of our human life. Even though He is omnipotent, He was not born the day after He was conceived, nor did He grow up the next day and begin to minister the following day. The Bible does not associate such signs and wonders with His human life. Instead, it shows the birth and growth of Jesus according to the law of human life: the Lord was born from His mother&rsquo;s womb after nine months, and He grew gradually. In His growth there were years as a child, years as a teenager, and years as a young adult. He did not begin His work until He was thirty years old. When we understand the significance of the law of life, we will realize that the increase and propagation that we are speaking of involve more than merely being stirred up to gain fifty thousand people in a short period of time. We must follow the law of life in John 15. It is very natural for a fruit tree to bear fruit in its season according to the inner law of life. This is a matter of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AND THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE UNIVERSAL VINE AS THE ORGANISM<br />
OF THE TRIUNE GOD,<br />
AND THE BELIEVERS AS BRANCHES IN THE VINE BEING IN AN ORGANIC UNION<br />
WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>According to John 15, Christ and the church are the universal vine. This vine is the organism of the Triune God. The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is this vine. Ephesians 4:4-6 shows that the Spirit, the Lord, and God are all mingled in the Body of Christ, which is the universal vine as the organism of the Triune God. As branches of this vine, the believers have an organic union with the Triune God.</p>
<p>The union that we have with God is an organic union. A table is not organic, because it is made with pieces of lifeless wood that are joined together by tenons, nails, and glue. In contrast, the human body is an organism that is joined together with living limbs and organs. The union of the human body is organic in nature. Even though a dentist can make a set of dentures, every person&rsquo;s first teeth are the issue of the growth of life. Life implies growth, because growth is the spontaneous issue of a living organism.</p>
<p>Our union with the Lord Jesus is a union with the Triune God, because the Lord Jesus is the embodiment of the Triune God; in Him the Triune God is realized. When we believed into the Lord, we entered into Him and were organically joined to Him (1 Cor. 6:17). The branches that are joined to a tree are not nailed to it; rather, they grow out of the tree. When a branch is grafted into a tree, it grows because the life within the branch is connected to the life within the tree; the growth of a grafted branch is the result of an organic union. Similarly, the union that we have with the Lord is an organic union.</p>
<p>In order to enjoy our organic union with the Lord, we need to abide in the Son. We can abide in the Son, because we are one spirit with Him. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; When we are one spirit with the Lord, we partake of His position and authority. Ephesians 2:5-6 tells us that we were crucified with Christ, raised up together with Him, and even seated together with Him in the heavenlies. Because we are in an organic union with Him, He and we, we and He, are joined as one in both position and authority. The Lord has been given all authority in heaven and on earth so that we could go and disciple all the nations (Matt. 28:18-19). In our going, His authority is our authority, and His heavenly position is our position. When we go forth to preach the gospel, we need the faith and realization that we are in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus and that we have His authority, because we are organically joined to Him.</p>
<p>When we abide in the Son, we absorb the Father&rsquo;s cultivation of the Son. In John 15:1 the Lord spoke of the Father as the husbandman. <em>Husbandman</em> means &ldquo;cultivator of the soil, land-worker, farmer.&rdquo; When we abide in the Son, we absorb the Son, who was cultivated by God the Father so that He could work Himself with all His riches into the vine, enabling us to partake of all the riches of the Father&rsquo;s divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). This is a matter in the spirit. We have to learn to abide in the Lord every day. As we abide in Him, we absorb the riches of God&rsquo;s cultivation by partaking of the divine nature.</p>
<p>When we abide in the Son, we experience the Spirit as the realization of the Son (John 14:17, 19; 15:26). The Lord Jesus is realized as the Spirit so that He can become the reality in us. Today the Lord Jesus is in us as the Spirit, and this Spirit is the realization of the Lord Jesus. When we pray, we have the assurance that He is operating in our spirit. When we lack strength, He operates in our spirit to become our strength. This is the Spirit becoming the realization of the Lord. We do not have holiness, but when we turn to the Lord and pray to Him, the Spirit operates in our spirit to work the Lord with His holy nature into us. Consequently, Christ becomes our holiness through the Spirit. The Spirit is the realization of Christ in our life and experience. Hence, when we abide in the Lord, we experience the Spirit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Spirit is also the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2) in those who believe in the Lord. He is the essence of life in us. We have a spiritual essence in us, and this essence is the Triune God. Today the Triune God is our essence, and the indwelling Spirit of life causes the Triune God to be realized in our experience.</p>
