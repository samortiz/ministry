   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ has made propitiation for us so that there may now be peace between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was prophesied in Genesis 49:10 and fulfilled in Ephesians 2:14-16.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word both refers to the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not only the uncircumcised Gentiles but also the circumcised Jews needed reconciliation to God through the redemption of Christ accomplished on His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cross of Christ, on the one hand, has slain the enmity caused by the ordinances which were given because of the flesh, and, on the other hand, has redeemed us with the blood of Christ shed upon it.</S>
