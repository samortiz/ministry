   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PEACEABLE FRUIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>YIELDED THROUGH DISCIPLINE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 11 says, "Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here the apostle draws special attention to the words at the present time and afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a fact that one does not feel happy at the time of discipline, but grievous.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that suffering is wrong when you experience God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Discipline is surely a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible does not say that the cross is a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It says rather that the cross is affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The cross brings us suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord despised the shame for the joy set before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible does not say that the cross is a joy; the cross is not a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is always a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not wrong to grieve and feel afflicted when we are disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we must learn obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only through obedience can we partake of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Discipline indeed is not a matter of joy "at the present time."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, it is grief to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not surprising; it is in fact quite normal for us to feel this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our Lord did not consider the trials a matter of joy when He passed through them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, we can make it a matter of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter said that we can exult in various trials 1 Pet 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, they are a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, we can reckon them to be a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How we feel is one thing, and how we reckon is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can feel grieved, but at the same time, we can reckon it to be a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A. Yielding the Peaceable Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A child of God should fix his eyes not on the present but on the future.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Pay attention to this sentence: "Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not look at the suffering you are going through now.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, look at the resulting peaceable fruit of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. Moab Being at Ease from His Youth</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>and Settling on His Lees</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jeremiah 48:11 says, "Moab has been at ease from his youth;/And he is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel;/Nor has he gone into exile.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are you clear what this is saying?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the problem with many who have not passed through trials.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The passage describes those who have never suffered any chastisement or sufferings before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Moabites had been at ease from their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They experienced no suffering or pain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What did such ease produce?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They became like wine settled on its lees.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a person brews liquor from grapes or other kinds of fruit, the wine surfaces to the top, while the lees settle to the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The wine floats, while the lees sink.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to clear the wine, it has to be poured from vessel to vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the lees remain at the bottom, sooner or later they will spoil the taste of the liquor.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In making wine, a man must first allow the grapes to ferment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After the grapes ferment, he transfers the wine from one vessel to another.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he is not careful, he will pour the lees out as well.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why he has to pour carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But one pouring is not enough; some lees are bound to escape into the other vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why he has to do this again.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A second time may still not clear the lees, and he has to pour the wine into a third vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He has to keep pouring until no lees are left in the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God said that Moab had been at ease from his youth and had settled on his lees.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He had not been emptied from vessel to vessel, and his lees always followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One must be emptied from vessel to vessel if he wants to do away with the lees.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He has to be poured out again and again until one day the lees at the bottom are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moab was full of lees; although he was clear at the top, he was not emptied at the bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Those who have never gone through trials and chastisement have never been emptied from vessel to vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Often it seems as if God is digging a person from his roots.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A brother may experience God's uprooting through his consecration; everything that he owns may be completely uprooted.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A brother may experience God's uprooting through his sufferings and trials; he may be stripped of everything he has.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is to be emptied from vessel to vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's hand will crush us thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He does this in order to clear away our lees!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To be at ease is not a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brothers and sisters, God wants to purify us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is why He disciplines and scourges us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Never consider ease and comfort to be something good.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Moab's ease caused him to remain Moab forever!</S>
