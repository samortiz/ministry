   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TEN SIGNS IN CHAPTERS FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN The Sign of the Father's House</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now go on to have an overview of the ten signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first sign in these chapters is the sign of the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians think that the Father's house in John 14 refers to a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This concept, however, is far off.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we come to chapter fourteen, we shall consider the revelation concerning God's dwelling place from the beginning in Genesis to the consummation in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We shall cover a number of items, the first of which will be Jacob's dream at Bethel Gen 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Bethel means the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In previous messages on Bethel we pointed out that Bethel is the gate of heaven, and that at Bethel heaven is brought down to earth, and earth is joined to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Genesis 28:17 Jacob declared, "This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, we are told in verse 12 that the ladder Jacob saw in his dream was "set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The vital point, however, is that the Lord stood above the ladder v. 13 . This indicates that the ladder actually reached not to heaven but to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This ladder brings God to earth and joins earth to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Genesis Jacob saw Bethel, but in Exodus Jacob's descendants built the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to realize that the tabernacle actually was Bethel, the house of God, God's dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, the tabernacle was the gate of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the tabernacle was erected, the glory of God descended upon it, filled it, and overshadowed it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, the tabernacle in Exodus became the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we see the progress from Bethel to the tabernacle and from the tabernacle to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may say that the Old Testament is a history of the tabernacle and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Old Testament God's people enjoyed the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to Psalm 132, it was the place of God's rest, the place that satisfied His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was also a place of rich provision for God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you know the Old Testament, you will realize that the enjoyment of God's redeemed people was the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They longed, yearned, to dwell in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The psalmist says that to dwell one day in the temple is better than dwelling a thousand days elsewhere 84:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How God's people appreciated His house!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Psalm 27:4, it was there they could behold the beauty of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 36:8 indicates that they were bountifully, abundantly satisfied with the fatness of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There in His house they drank of the river of God's pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Hebrew word translated "pleasures" is the plural of the word for Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that God's people drank the river of Eden, the river of paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's people also longed to be planted in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They knew that they would grow in the house of God as a green olive tree full of sap and that even in old age they would continue to bear fruit 52:8; 92:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All these verses in the Psalms indicate the enjoyment of the Old Testament saints in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Apart from God's dwelling place, the temple, the Old Testament saints did not have any enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The record in the Old Testament does not speak of entertainment or amusement enjoyed by God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, the Bible tells us only of the feasts at Mount Zion around the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was their real enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their holy days, their holidays, were the feasts, and their weekend was the Sabbath, a day on which they enjoyed resting with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Their enjoyment was altogether related to the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a brief description of the Father's house in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In forthcoming messages we shall also consider the Father's house in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first aspect of the Father's house in the New Testament is Christ incarnated to be the tabernacle John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The incarnated Christ was the Father's house, the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through Christ's death and resurrection, this tabernacle was enlarged and became the church, the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth 1 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, the church as God's dwelling place will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, there are six matters related to the great sign of the Father's house: Bethel, the tabernacle, the temple, Christ, the church, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
