   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRANSFORMING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul continues by saying that the Lord Jesus is the transforming Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Doctrine, culture, religion, and knowledge can only confine us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They could never change or transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the living Christ has come into us not to confine us, but to transform us, to change our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He does this by saturating our whole being with His being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His holy, divine, spiritual, eternal, and heavenly element has not only been added into our being, but it is saturating what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually we will be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That means to be transformed to what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And this transformation is from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is from one degree of glory to another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Day by day we are being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have been in Los Angeles for twelve years, and there are many saints here whom I have come to know in these past years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am so happy to say that many have become more like Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the transforming effect of the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Transformation comes out of His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His indwelling implies the life giving, the liberating, and the transformation, and it also implies a kind of killing of whatever we are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His indwelling kills our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is in order that He may transform us into His being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>UP AND DOWN TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus is not religion or doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is a living reality, not only in the heavens, but even more real in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And He is all the time moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I realize that especially among the young people, the sky is always fluctuating.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At four o clock in the afternoon the sky was clear, but just thirty minutes later, it is cloudy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is continually fluctuating.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We would all like to be stable; if not in the third heavens, at least in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one likes to be down on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, whether we are up or down does not make much difference.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jesus is still doing a work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I can testify concerning so many young people that I have been watching over during the past ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They have been up and down, up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They had the up and down transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Regardless of whether we feel we are in the third heavens or in the deep hell, Jesus is still moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are up, He is moving.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we are down, He is moving.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He never stops.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His intention is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus knows our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He knows that we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the thing that I treasure so much, to see so many young people loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the real mercy in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I never saw so many young people in other Christian groups loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a great grace upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as we love the Lord, His intention is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether we feel we are up or down, makes no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we are up, He is working.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we are down, He is still working.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I believe that many of us are disappointed when we lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I don t encourage you to lose your temper, but neither would I advise you not to lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whether I tell you not to lose your temper or to go ahead and lose it makes no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you lose your temper, you will just lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I cannot help you, and the Lord Jesus wouldn t help you either.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is because He knows, when we lose our temper, He is able to work more within us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times Christ has been wrought into our being through the losing of our temper more than through other things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But don t think that I am encouraging you to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I was a young man, for a long period of time I was nice to everybody.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But I can testify that through that long period Christ was not wrought so deeply into me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then the Lord took my goodness away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I would praise the Lord in the morning, but I would lose my temper with my wife at noon.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then I would be down.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I just couldn t live.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I would say, O Lord Jesus, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I lost my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Later I realized that when I was down to that extent, Christ was wrought into me much more.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as you love the Lord Jesus, I can assure you that you will be the elevator going up and down, up and down.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is through this kind of experiences that Christ is wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is especially true in the first stage of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To lose our temper affords much opportunity for Christ to be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the work of the indwelling Christ to work Himself into us that we may be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is not merely by studying, reading the Bible, or praying.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Of course, I don t mean that we shouldn t do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But many times Christ has to be wrought into us through our failure.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our failure affords a good opportunity to the Lord that He may work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Of course we should not try to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>That is a kind of performance.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But as we are loving the Lord Jesus in our up and down situation, He is working within us as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He is working by His indwelling to transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is His main work today.</S>
