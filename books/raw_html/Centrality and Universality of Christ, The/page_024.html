<P>Now as Christians, we need to check and see where we are today. Are we in the outer court, in the Holy Place, or in the Holy of Holies? Are we in Egypt, in the wilderness, or in the good land? Are we in the flesh, in the soul, or in the spirit where Christ is and which is the Holy of Holies to Christ? First, you may say you are in Egypt, in the outer court, or in the fleshly body. Second, you may say you are in the wilderness, in the Holy Place, or in the soul. Third, you may say you are in the good land of Canaan, in the Holy of Holies, or in the spirit. Are you in the first part, second part, or third part? Some may say they are in the second part. To be in the second part is to be neutral, lukewarm. If you are neutral, or lukewarm, you are neither cold nor hot, and the Lord will spew you out (Rev. 3:15-16). We need to advance. Look at the history of the children of Israel. They displeased the Lord simply by wandering in the wilderness.</P><P>We need to see that the goal set before us by the Lord is the Holy of Holies, that is, the spirit. The spirit is the innermost part of a human being. It is where Christ is today. It is the Holy of Holies to Him. Also, to be in our spirit is to be in the good land. In our spirit is Christ's Spirit, so this good land is Christ Himself. Hebrews 10:19 says that we have the boldness for entering the Holy of Holies. We are told, encouraged, and charged to have the boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies.</P><P>Some Christian teachers say that the Holy of Holies is in heaven. On the one hand, I admit that the Holy of Holies today is in heaven, where the Lord Jesus is (Heb. 9:12, 24). However, if the Holy of Holies were only in heaven, how could we enter into it while we are on earth today? On the one hand, the Holy of Holies is in heaven, but on the other hand, it is in our human spirit. The very Christ who is in heaven is now also in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). As the heavenly ladder (Gen. 28:12; John 1:51), He joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit. Hence, heaven today is in our spirit. Our regenerated spirit, our recovered spirit, our cleansed spirit, is the Holy of Holies today. Thus, it is easy for us to enter into the Holy of Holies. Wherever we are, there the Holy of Holies is, because it is the innermost part of our being. Hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies.</P><P>The problem is that many of us do not know where our spirit is. Once I was living in a house for many months, yet I was not aware that there was a secret room in the house. Likewise, many of us have been Christians for years, yet we have not discovered that there is a secret chamber within us which is the Holy of Holies, where Christ is today. That secret chamber is our human spirit, where Christ, the living One, the life-giving Spirit, the freeing Spirit, the transforming Spirit, the wonderful Spirit, dwells. We have to realize this.</P>
