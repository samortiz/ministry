<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching teaches us concerning the faith, not concerning the law. To teach concerning the law was something of Moses and the priests of the Old Testament. In the New Testament, however, the apostles&rsquo; teaching is altogether the faith in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This faith, which is the contents of the New Testament, was first taught by the Lord Jesus when He ministered on earth. After His resurrection He told the disciples, &ldquo;Go therefore...teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19-20). The disciples were charged to teach all the nations to observe all that the Lord commanded them. Therefore, the first aspect of the apostles&rsquo; teaching is related to the things that the Lord Jesus taught while ministering on the earth for three and a half years. At the end of that time, He told His disciples, &ldquo;I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality&rdquo; (John 16:12-13). The Spirit of reality in the disciples was to lead them into the profound truths. These profound truths are the economy of God.</p>
<p>The center of God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament is that Christ, the God-man, accomplished redemption, entered into resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit, enters into all who believe into Him to be their life, their everything, their life supply, and their person, and mingles Himself with them to be one spirit with them to make them members of His Body. The center of God&rsquo;s economy is to save us to the extent that Christ becomes our Head and we become His members.</p>
<p>In regard to this center, Christianity has spoken, at most, only concerning Jesus living in us. Twenty years ago, when I came to the United States, people told me that they never knew that there is a spirit within man. However, twenty years later Christian radio stations are now telling people that there is a spirit in man. Sadly, they do not know that there is a verse in the Bible that says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45b). Not only do they not know that Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, but they even consider it a heresy. Christianity adheres to the doctrine of &ldquo;three persons, one substance,&rdquo; saying that in the Godhead there are three persons with one substance. This is to say that the Father is a person, the Son is a person, and the Spirit is a person. This can lead to tritheism if the persons are considered to be both distinct and separate. This was condemned by the church fathers.</p>
<p>Ever since we came out of mainland China and went abroad, we have had the burden to tell people that as persons, we have another person living within us; a regenerated person is the dwelling place of God. We also have the burden to tell people that the Lord Jesus is God who became flesh, passed through human living, died, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit. Many may acknowledge that Christ lives in His believers, yet how could Christ enter into them and dwell in them unless He became the Spirit? For Him to dwell in His believers, the Lord Jesus must be realized as the Spirit. Since Christianity teaches the doctrine of &ldquo;three persons, one substance,&rdquo; most Christians dare not say that Christ is the Spirit. Although they advocate the doctrine of &ldquo;three persons, one substance,&rdquo; they also say that there should not be the confounding of the persons. This means that one should not say that the Father is the Son, that the Son is the Spirit, or that the Spirit is the Son. Hence, they dare not say that Christ is the Spirit, because once they say that Christ is the Spirit, they believe that they are confounding the three persons of the Godhead.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; A number of people understand <em>the Lord</em> here as referring to Jehovah in the Old Testament. As a result, in this verse God&rsquo;s being the Spirit corresponds with John 4:24, which says that &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; This is to misinterpret the truth of the Lord being the Spirit and thus to lose the revelation of the truth.</p>
<p>For twenty years we have been fighting the battle for the truth, and we have read quite a number of books on this subject. According to our observation, the booklets published by Christianity are influenced by the thought that the three in the Godhead are three distinct and separate persons. However, the fact is that God is distinct in person but absolutely not separate. We have published a number of books which show from the Gospels that although the Lord Jesus came to the earth from heaven, He came to the earth with the Father. He said, &ldquo;He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone&rdquo; (John 8:29). When He was on the earth, He did not work by Himself, because the Father was with Him. Not only was the Father with Him, but the Spirit was also with Him wherever he went. Therefore, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were embodied in Jesus the Nazarene.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> </body></html>
