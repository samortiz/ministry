   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW THE ELDERS SHOULD BE TO THE CHURCHES Needing to Have a Vision concerning the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The elders need to have a vision concerning the church Matt 16:16-18; Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They need a vision to see all the foregoing items in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For over fifty-eight years the tone of this ministry has never changed because of the vision we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have never changed our speaking despite all the turmoils in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, all the turmoils have strengthened our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Needing to Love the Church as the Flock of God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elders also need to love the church as the flock of God Acts 20:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is God's flock, and the elders are those appointed by God to care for the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As such, the elders need to love the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should love the church as a mother loves her own children 1 Thes 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In taking care of a church we should never take the way of legality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we take the legal way, we will bring trouble to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Love is the only way that can build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being the Overseers in the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The elders are the overseers in the church life Acts 20:17, 28a; Phil 1:1; 1 Tim 3:1-2, 6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An elder is a person of maturity, whereas an overseer refers to the function of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The responsibility and function of an elder is to oversee the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not Being the Rulers of the Church,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lording It over the Church,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>but Being Patterns of the Flock,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Taking the Lead in the Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The elders are not the rulers of the church, lording it over the church, but rather patterns of the flock, taking the lead in the church life 1 Pet 5:3; 1 Tim 5:17; Rom 12:8; 1 Thes 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The elders are overseers but not rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a matter is taken care of in the wrong way, the elders should not correct too strongly by rebuking but should simply take care of it in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way, everyone will see the proper way to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They must not lord it over or rule over the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a rest room has not been cleaned well, an elder should not blame or complain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, because he is an overseer, he has seen it, and he can silently clean it in a better way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>An overseer is not a ruler but a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a proper pattern has not been built up, the overseer should build it up.</S>
