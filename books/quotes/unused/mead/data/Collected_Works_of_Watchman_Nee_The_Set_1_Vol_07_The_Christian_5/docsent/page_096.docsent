   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The cross is related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 21 is a prophecy, whereas verse 28 is a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 27:"For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings."</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 8:"And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not say too quickly, "Hear Him," for this hearing may refer to 16:21.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 1-2:"And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Truly I say to you, There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How cold is our Lord toward the world!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The temple can be compared to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He passed through this world without giving heed to it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The disciples, on the other hand, were drawn to the beauty and attractive things of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a reason for the Lord's coldness; He knew that the world would be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Since all these things are to be thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness" 2 Pet 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Men love the world because they think that the world will last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Little do they realize that the heaven and the earth will be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Blessed are those who understand 1 John 2:17!</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The foolish ones are foolish not because they have not prepared the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The failure to prepare the oil is only a manifestation of their foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 4:"But the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How troublesome it is to have another extra vessel!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The world's tone is always, "Why bother to serve the Lord so seriously?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>MATTHEW 26</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verses 69-75:"Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But he denied it before all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And after he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And after a little while those who were standing there came to Peter and said, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech also makes it clear that you are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then he began to curse and to swear: I do not know the man!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And immediately a rooster crowed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And he went out and wept bitterly."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps Peter thought that it was better to deny the Lord and save his life for future use, rather than confess the Lord and lose his life then!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Little did he realize that this was a mournful act v. 75 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>MATTHEW 27</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 4:"Saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You see to that yourself!"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Judas knew his sins but would not trust in the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This made him a "son of perdition."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 18:"For he knew that it was because of envy that they had delivered Him up."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The sin of Pilate!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>1 CORINTHIANS 6</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verses 13-14:"Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach for foods; but God will bring to nought both it and them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise us up through His power."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Food and the stomach --both will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord and the body --both have gone through or will go through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 15:"Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Absolutely not!"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Food and the stomach are joined as one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the same way our body and the Lord are also joined as one; we are the members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 16:"Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For He says, The two shall be one flesh.'"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who are joined to a prostitute, like food joined to the stomach, will become one body with her.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>1 CORINTHIANS 8</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verses 1-2:"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Knowledge is versus love.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Man has nothing to boast of concerning what he knows, for he still does not know what he ought to know.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, knowledge always puffs up, whereas love builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When there is love, one does not care for what he knows; rather, he takes care of others' ignorance and will not cause others to stumble through his own liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Verse 3:"But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The greatest love is the love to God, and the greatest knowledge is to be known by God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Verse 12:"And sinning in this way against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Those who wound others have wounded Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To put it another way, those who love others love God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who love God have the real knowledge v. 3 . Hence, those who have caused others to stumble through their knowledge are not loving others; they do not love God, and they are void of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>1 CORINTHIANS 9</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Verses 9-10:"For in the law of Moses it is written: You shall not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.'</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Is it for oxen that God cares?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Or does He say it altogether for our sake?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Yes, for our sake it was written because the plowman should plow in hope, and he who threshes, in hope of partaking."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is the way to interpret the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Verse 19:"For though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all that I might gain the more."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All those who truly love the Lord have such experience.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>1 CORINTHIANS 10</S>
