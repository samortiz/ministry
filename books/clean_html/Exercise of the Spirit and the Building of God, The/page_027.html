<h2 class="head1">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s work of recovery, the Word functions to instruct, correct, and supply. The supply also depends on the Spirit. In the New Testament the Word, the Spirit, and the Lord are one. In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; This verse shows that there is a relationship between the words of the Lord and the Spirit. From our fellowship it might seem as though the Lord&rsquo;s words and the Spirit are not related. However, the Lord&rsquo;s words are related to the Spirit because He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; This shows us that the Lord is the Spirit. Furthermore, John 1:1 says, &ldquo;The Word was God.&rdquo; Thus, the Lord is also the Word. The Lord is the Word, the Lord is the Spirit, and His words are the embodiment of the Spirit. If the Lord&rsquo;s words pass through us in a proper way, they are of the Lord, and they are also of the Spirit. Therefore, if the words that we release in the church are of God, they convey not only His utterance but also God Himself as the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Epistles to the Ephesians and to the Colossians provide a further basis for saying that the Word and the Spirit are one. Ephesians and Colossians have many parallel portions. For example, both Epistles speak of praising the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs (Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16). However, there is a slight difference. Ephesians speaks of praising the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs because we are filled in spirit. We must be filled with the Spirit of the Lord in our spirit in order to praise the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Colossians speaks of praising the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs because we are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word. Both Epistles speak of praising the Lord, but one says that our praising is the result of being filled with the Spirit, and the other says that it is the result of being filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word. This shows that the Lord&rsquo;s words are the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRETHREN</h2>
<p>The ministry of the word should convey the Spirit. However, sometimes the ministry of the word falls into a situation in which mere words are uttered, without the Spirit. Then the ministry of the word is no longer the utterance of the Lord, because it does not contain His element. This condition speaks of the church&rsquo;s degradation. Around 1827 the Brethren were raised up, and they recovered many items related to the Word. For about fifty years after 1828 numerous ministers of the Word were raised up among the Brethren. Those who were raised up include J. N. Darby; C. H. Mackintosh, author of <em>Notes on the Pentateuch;</em> F. W. Grant, author of <em>The Numerical Bible;</em> James Taylor Jr.; and B. W. Newton. They were great ministers of the Word. Through them the Word of God was released like sea billows rolling upon the shore.</p>
<p>The release of the Word through the Brethren was like waves of the truth surging into the church. The words they spoke were living and full of the Spirit. Regrettably, in the second half of the nineteenth century the Brethren fell into division and lost the Spirit. Now most of their groups have fallen into doctrines and letters; they are short of the Spirit. They lack the fresh and living condition that they possessed in the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PENTECOSTAL MOVEMENT</h2>
<p>For a period of eighty to ninety years, beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, God raised up the Pentecostal movement as a reaction to the deadened situation among the Brethren. The believers in the Pentecostal movement did not focus on the Word or on its interpretation. They focused on being filled with the Holy Spirit, that is, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. They sang spiritual songs and spoke in tongues. The believers in the Pentecostal movement reacted to the deadened situation among the Brethren to the extent that they abandoned all regulations. In some places they even broke the norms of human behavior.</p>
<p>At the peak of the Pentecostal movement, there were three major groups: the jumpers, the laughers, and the rollers. These terms sound funny, but they were actually the three major groups of the Pentecostal movement. I had the occasion to attend their meetings and observe their situation. The jumpers did not jump in an ordinary manner; they jumped high above the ground. Their behavior seemed funny, but they were quite serious. The laughers laughed loudly, and the rollers rolled on the floor. In those days an elderly sister among us was affected by the Pentecostal movement. She would always roll when she received the outpouring of the Spirit. Consequently, when she knelt down to pray at home, her servant would immediately move the furniture in order to give her enough space in which to roll.</p>
<p>Such stories sound peculiar, but it is undeniable that the Pentecostal movement was raised up by God, because crowds of people were brought to salvation through them. Those who had been indifferent to the Lord gave up everything for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. We must not condemn the Pentecostal movement too harshly. We can only say that it was truly a reaction from God.</p>
<p>The Brethren and the Pentecostal movement are illustrations of God&rsquo;s work. He must supply His church with the Word as well as with the Spirit. The normal condition of the church should be that the ministry of the word is full of the Spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s words are the Spirit, and the Lord is the Spirit; moreover, the Word is the Lord. The Lord, the Spirit, and the Word are inseparable. When the church is in an abnormal condition, the ministry of the word is no longer with the Spirit. Rather, the ministry of the word becomes dead letters. At such a time God has to raise up a group of people to focus on the Spirit as a reaction to the deadened condition of the church.</p>
