<h2 class="head2">Si-Tou</h2><p>Since my return home, I stayed with the co-workers in Ping-Yang for a few months learning to preach the gospel. Last year I was in Brother Wu Siu-liang's house in Tung-Cheng teaching a few children and helping to preach the gospel. God has affirmed the gospel with miracles and wonders, and many people have come to listen, among whom many have believed. It is a blessing for my eyes to be able to behold His work. Thank Him. There was only one household in Tung-Cheng in the beginning, plus a few brothers from out of town. But now there are over a hundred people meeting every Lord's Day. Thank the Lord and glory to Him! The Lord has indeed opened the door of the gospel for His church. I answered the call of the brothers in Si-Tou, which is a few dozen miles from Tung-Cheng, to take a part-time teaching job and to learn to serve the Lord part-time. The Lord's table has been raised up with over ten brothers and sisters. On the Lord's Day there are over thirty people in the meeting. There are two more desolate areas in Fu-Ting that now have churches of God. All the work is the result of the pioneering effort of co-workers from Ping-Yang. I tell you this as an aid to your prayer. The Lord has led Brothers Hwa Shi-bin, David Hsu, and Chang Kwang-rong to work in Ping-Yang, Tai-Shun, and Fu-Ting for a while. Thank the Lord.</p><p>Lin Wei-jung, October 14</p><h2 class="head2">Yu-Si, Fu-Ching, Fukien Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord that He has given us peace so that we can testify to His salvation. Enclosed please find X dollars for The Open Door. The remaining balance is for brothers and sisters who are exiled because of the war. May the Lord care for His children, amen. Liem Tjiong Dil and his family and Sister Lin Ong Rue-tze have left for Southeast Asia.</p><p>Brothers in the church in Yu-Si, Fu-Ching,<br />Lin Wei-tzi, Lin Shao-liang, Chai Yi-sung, October 29</p><h2 class="head2">Bei-Si-Ting, Fu-Ching, Fukien Province</h2><p>By the Lord's grace, we are forwarding X dollars for The Open Door and X dollars for brothers and sisters in need because of the war or for the work in the inland regions. Please distribute it as the Lord leads. (The above amount has been sent to saints in need in Hunan province&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Brother Tseng Bing-hun, December 22</p><h2 class="head2">Pu-Tien, Fukien Province</h2><p>The local church in Pu-Tien is forwarding X dollars by the Lord's grace. This amount is to supply the needs of the saints suffering from the war in Hankow. Please distribute it according to the Lord's leading. Although a cup of water cannot quench the fire from a cartload of wood, it shows the heart of the brothers and sisters in the Lord. May the Lord bless this little sum.</p><p>Brothers Chu Ai-tseng and Lin Ru-jin, October 31, 1938</p><h2 class="head2">Chuenchow, Fukien Province</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars. Please direct it according to the Lord's leading for the brothers who are suffering. (This sum has been distributed in Hunan province&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Brothers Lan Jin-yang, Chai Tze-chung, Wang Deng-ming,<br />Han Jin-siu, Chen Ke-san, and Chen Jai-seng</p><h2 class="head2">Feng-Ting, Fukien Province</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars which are designated to relieve the brothers in dire conditions because of the war. The church here has seen some increase of saved ones, but one or two sisters have been tried through sickness and death. As a result some new believers have been weakened. Please pray for this. Greetings to the saints in Shanghai.</p><p>Brothers Chen Tuo-sien and Chen Bing-jiu<br />January 16, 1939</p>
