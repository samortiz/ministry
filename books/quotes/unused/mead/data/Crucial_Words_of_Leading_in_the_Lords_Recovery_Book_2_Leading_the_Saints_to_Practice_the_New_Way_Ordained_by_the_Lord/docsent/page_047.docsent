   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:7-9; 4:1; Eph 4:11-12; Acts 2:42</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament ministry and the apostles teaching are two matters in the church that have not been accurately understood by most believers for the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Brethren, who were raised up in England about one and a half centuries ago, saw a little concerning the apostles teaching and began to pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apart from them, nearly all other Christian groups are neither clear nor pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word for ministry means service, or work, that is, to serve as a slave; service is a kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the ministry as referred to in the New Testament carries a more precise and refined significance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament this word is used in relation to particular people and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To serve and take care of a patient is a ministry Matt 25:44 , and to serve tables, as the seven brothers did in Acts 6:5 is also a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition, the Bible says, Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it Col 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A believer s personal service to the Lord is also a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, some brothers and sisters clean the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whether they wipe the chairs, mop the floor, vacuum the carpet, or wash the windows, all of which are seemingly trivial tasks, their service is a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts 1:17 and 25 speak of this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After the Lord s ascension, Peter, one of the twelve apostles, asked the Lord to choose someone to become a witness with the apostles of His resurrection and to take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ministry that the twelve apostles received was to bear the testimony of the Lord Jesus, testifying that He is the Triune God and that, as the Son of God, He was incarnated to be a man to pass through human living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, that He was nailed to the cross and died there according to the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God 2:23 , that He was raised up after three days, and that in resurrection He appeared to the apostles and disciples, charging them to preach Him as the gospel to the whole inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul speaks of the New Testament ministry as this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here the phrase this ministry has an even greater significance than the ministry of which Peter spoke in Acts 1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The ministry spoken of by Peter is the ministry that the twelve apostles received from the Lord Jesus, who was incarnated, passed through human living, died, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, their ministry was to preach this God-man to all the nations, telling them how He was incarnated, passed through various processes of human living, died, and resurrected to become the Savior of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the ministry Peter received.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is clear that the ministry Peter received is not focused on the church; it speaks only of Christ, that is, how the eternal God became a man, passed through death and resurrection, and became both Lord and Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the ministry that the twelve apostles received, and it is the first half of the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, when Paul spoke of this ministry in 2 Corinthians, much more was included.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The ministry he speaks of includes the ministry that Peter speaks of and applies the Christ whom Peter and the other apostles had received to those who are chosen, redeemed, and justified, causing them to become members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the New Testament ministry.</S>
