[1]  Elders Training Book 05, Fellowship Concerning the Lord s Up-To-Date Move CONTENTS
[2]  The One Thing, the Unique Thing, in the Lord s Recovery
[3]  We believe it is altogether of You that we are all gathered together into Yourself.
[4]  Lord, grant Your blessing upon all of us and do bless this time.
[5]  This other vision is mainly described in verse 18: To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me. Forgiveness of sins is the initial grace and the base of all the blessings of the New Testament jubilee, while the inheritance is the main object of this heavenly vision.
[6]  I have been with many of you brothers in the English-speaking world for over twenty-two years.
[7]  Truthfully speaking, many of you are still under a kind of ignorance.
[8]  What you do, what you say, and how you take care of the churches, indicates that you are short of the vision that I have seen and that the Lord has been speaking to us for the past twenty-two years.
[9]  I am especially regretful that it is as if some of you have never heard the messages given in the elders training of 1984.
[10]  In those messages the New Testament ministry, the vision of the Lord s recovery, the way to carry out the vision, and other crucial matters concerning the practice of the Lord s recovery were stressed very much.
[11]  At that time the entire vision of the Lord s recovery was presented to you concerning God, concerning Christ, concerning the Spirit, concerning the believers, concerning the church, concerning the kingdom, and concerning the New Jerusalem.
[12]  What is the vision that the Lord has shown us for His up-to-date recovery?
[13]  The Lord began His recovery at least by the time of the reformers, among whom was Martin Luther.
[14]  The one thing that should be focused on, stressed, and ministered in the Lord s recovery is the New Testament economy of God.
[15]  In the second section of God s New Testament economy is the Spirit, as the Son, with the Father.
[16]  I consider the fifty-one messages I gave on God s New Testament economy in 1984 as a consummation of what the Lord has shown us in His recovery.
[17]  In John 14 the embodiment of God tells us that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter v. 16 . This another Comforter is the very realization of the embodiment of God, so He is called the Spirit of reality v. 17 . He is the realization of the Lord Jesus Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[18]  In John 16:13-15 the embodiment of the Triune God, Jesus, tells us clearly that in the divine Trinity whatever the Father is and has is embodied in the Son, whatever the Son is and has is received by the Spirit, and whatever the Spirit receives is disclosed to the believers.
[19]  The Son is the embodiment of God, the Spirit is the realization of the Son, and the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the divine Trinity by seven major steps taken by the processed Triune God: incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, the breathing of the life-giving Spirit into His chosen people, ascension, and the pouring out of Himself as the consummated Spirit upon His chosen people.
[20]  This wonderful One died on the cross with at least seven qualifications: as the Lamb of God John 1:29 He died to deal with our sin and sins 1 Pet 2:24; Heb 9:26, 28; 1 Cor 15:3 ; as a man in the flesh John 1:14 He died in the form of fallen man, in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 , to condemn sin in the flesh and deal with the flesh; as the brass serpent John 3:14; Num 21:4-9 He died to bruise the serpent s head Gen 3:15 and to destroy him Heb 2:14 , along with his satanic world John 12:31 , that all His believers may have eternal life John 3:15-16 ; as the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45 , the representative of the old man, He died to crucify our old man Rom 6:6 ; as the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 He died on the cross as part of the old creation to terminate the entire old creation; as the Peacemaker Eph 2:14-15 He died to abolish all the ordinances and differences in living, customs, and habits between all kinds of peoples for the creation of the new man; finally, He died as a grain of wheat to release the divine life for His reproduction John 12:24 .
[21]  The Triune God was embodied in the Son, realized and consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit, and as the seven Spirits, the intensification of the Triune God in the book of Revelation, He finalizes His New Testament economy.
[22]  My concern is that many of you have never gotten into these things and that you do not have any interest or any burden to teach people these things.
[23]  Instead you may pick up one small item of the recovery and make it a big item.
[24]  We must realize again that the thing in the Lord s recovery is the content of God s New Testament economy the Triune God embodied, realized, and consummated and taking the seven steps of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, breathing Himself into His believers, ascension, and pouring Himself out to dispense Himself entirely into His people as a Body.
[25]  In the finalization of His New Testament economy in the book of Revelation He is the seven Spirits, out from the eternal One, of the Redeemer, the intensification of the Triune God in the overcoming church, consummating in the golden lampstands and the New Jerusalem.
[26]  Justification by faith is not the thing, but it is one item in the Lord s progressive recovery of the basic truths.
[27]  I also am not an advocate of the so-called baptism in the Holy Spirit according to the Pentecostal understanding, but in the past sixty years, by the Lord s mercy, the Lord has raised up approximately six hundred churches through the ministry the Lord has committed me with.
[28]  I really love all of you because you have left so many things for the Lord s recovery and you have even designated yourself for the Lord s move in this country.
[29]  In this chapter I would like to consider some verses from 1 Timothy.
[30]  Verse 4 of chapter two says that God desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth.
[31]  In verses 15 and 16 of chapter three are four main things: the church as the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, the great mystery of godliness, and the manifestation of God in the flesh.
[32]  In 1 Timothy 6:3 Paul tells us that we have to restrict ourselves to the healthy words, especially the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which is according to godliness, that is, God expressed through us.
[33]  In John 6 the Lord tells us that the words spoken by Him are spirit v. 63 . The Word was God, the Word became embodied, and the words spoken out of the mouth of this embodiment are spirit.
[34]  My burden is to share with you concerning the biggest shortage among us today.
[35]  The biggest shortage is that the elders are short of the full knowledge of the truth.
[36]  In John 17:17 the Lord prayed, Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.
[37]  I do not care for how much gift you have gained or how much you can speak in tongues; I care for how much you can teach the solid truth.
[38]  I believe this is why the Apostle Paul, after writing Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews, wrote 1 Timothy in such a way.
[39]  The truth in 1 Timothy 2:4 is not the truth mainly concerning baptism, nor the truth mainly concerning the gifts, but the truth concerning the Triune God manifested in the flesh.
[40]  You may say that you are in the recovery, that you are one with the ministry, and that you are for the Lord s testimony today, but where are you actually?
[41]  I encourage you to get a copy of these messages and at least to read through them once, but I also hope that you would study them, especially the first two books on the ministry of the New Testament and on the vision of the Lord s recovery.
[42]  Let us now consider the practicality of being constituted with the truth.
[43]  The highest truth in the Lord s recovery is the truth concerning the Trinity.
[44]  God in this verse indicates the Trinity since the Hebrew word for God Elohim is plural in number.
[45]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all 2 Cor 13:14 .
[46]  By His mercy we have studied to such an extent that we can say that His living was the living of a God-man who is the Son of God with the Father by the Spirit.
[47]  The brothers who are going out as the gospel team in these days have set up a good example.
[48]  These brothers are going out, not to preach a shallow gospel, but rather to preach the higher gospel, even to preach the Triune God to people.
[49]  Even in giving his opinion, eventually in the last verse of the chapter he said, I think that I also have the Spirit of God v. 40 . Could you explain the truth that is here? How could giving one s opinion be having the Spirit of God? This is a deeper truth.
[50]  In the verses listed on page 37, the Word is revealed in many different aspects.
[51]  One of the ways to study the Bible is to count the occurrences of certain things, and then to arrange them in a good sequence.
[52]  These verses tell us that the Word became flesh, that the Lord came through incarnation, full of grace and truth.
[53]  The old creation was created by God s word.
[54]  The universe came into being through the Word of God John 1:1, 3; Heb 11:3 .
[55]  John 5:24 says, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
[56]  First Peter 1:23 says that we were regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.
[57]  To take in the word of Christ simply means to take Christ in. To let the word of Christ dwell in you is to let Christ dwell in you.
[58]  This is why Paul used this word, mystery, indicating at least three things: first, the mystery of God is Christ Col 2:2 ; second, the mystery of Christ is the church Eph 3:4-6 ; and third, putting these two together, there is the great mystery, Christ and the church Eph 5:32 .
[59]  We must now consider the home meetings, the meetings of the small groups.
[60]  The traditional way for the Christians to meet is to have a gathering, to gather the members of the church or perhaps some unbelievers.
[61]  Two of the books in the New Testament which describe the Christian way of meeting are Acts and 1 Corinthians.
[62]  Acts 5:42 says, And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.
[63]  First Corinthians 14 describes the Christian way of meeting when the whole church comes together in one place v. 23 . In verse 26 Paul says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.
[64]  Then God spoke a word saying, Let there be light: And there was light v. 3 . In the old creation, God, the Spirit, and the Word all worked together to bring forth creation.
[65]  You must learn to have the word of God deposited in you.
[66]  Then you must learn to speak the word of God, not on shallow things, but on deeper things such as the Triune God embodied, realized, and consummated, the seven major steps or processes of the Triune God, and the intensification of the Triune God.
[67]  From chapter one of 1 Corinthians we should go on to chapter two to speak the deep things of God v. 10 , that is, to speak God s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom...which God predestined before the ages for our glory 2:7 . Practice speaking.
[68]  You have to tell people that for Christ to be the firstborn Son of God means that He was God, that He became man by putting on human nature, and that He was sonized in His resurrection in His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God.
[69]  I believe that in the long run the Lord will gain something.
[70]  It is not only a matter of us gaining something.
[71]  Today there is a shallow gospel with a shallow revelation of Christ telling a person that he is a sinner, that God loves him, and that God gave His Son for him.
[72]  Strictly speaking, six verses in the New Testament say something about how the believers should meet Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:23 and 26; Hebrews 10:25; and Matthew 18:20.
[73]  In Acts 20:6-12 there is an account of a meeting in Troas in which the Apostle Paul gave a message, but this passage of Scripture cannot give us a hint concerning how the church should meet locally since the local church meeting is different from a meeting for ministry.
[74]  Hebrews 10:25 says, Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.
[75]  This verse gives us a little window to show us how the saints met in the early days of the church life.
[76]  Basically speaking, we should not meet in big meetings, but with a small number.
[77]  The Lord refers to two or three meeting together into His name.
[78]  By the Lord s word in Matthew 18:20 we can realize that in the Lord s intention He did not want to have big gatherings in the local church for practical help.
[79]  THE PROBLEM OF CONTROL AND OF A SEPARATE WORK
[80]  In 1976 when I was sharing on Matthew 23, I spoke strongly against the matter of control.
[81]  In February of 1984 in the elders training I spoke against the matter of control even more strongly.
[82]  In the New Testament there are only three designations of the church: the church of God 1 Cor 1:2 , the church of Christ Rom 16:16 , and the church of the saints 1 Cor 14:33 .
[83]  However, the word, either logos or rhema , is mentioned seventy-eight times in this book, whereas the Spirit, referring to the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, is used less than sixty times.
[84]  A third big Protestant denomination today is the Church of Christ.
[85]  Thirty years ago an American missionary of the Church of Christ who went to Taiwan told me that there were about one million in that denomination.
[86]  This is why I feel very sorrowful that some of you would pick up something else besides the rich word to bring into the Lord s recovery as a part of the Lord s recovery.
[87]  For quite a long time I have been considering how to use the Life-studies.
[88]  AND THE AGE OF RESTORATION KNOWING THE BIBLE ACCORDING TO DISPENSATIONS
[89]  We have already seen that in order to expound the Bible in a proper, adequate, and high way we need a knowledge of the theology of the Brethren.
[90]  Paul wrote Hebrews 6:4-5 according to God s dispensations: For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those who were once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age.
[91]  Between eternity past and eternity future there are basically three ages: the age of the old creation, the age of the new creation, and the age of restoration.
[92]  From God s creation of the heavens and the earth in Genesis 1:1 to the beginning of the age of grace is the time span of the age of the old creation.
[93]  Matthew 19:28 describes the age of restoration, the coming kingdom age Acts 3:21 , after the Lord s second coming And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
[94]  If Peter had had the concept that miracles were something for the new creation he might have told the Lord, Lord, you have used me to raise up the dead.
[95]  Wonders and signs are not part of God s central testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, neither are they part of His full salvation; the Lord borrowed the miraculous things from the coming age to show that what the apostles preached and ministered and how they acted were absolutely of God, not of man Acts 2:43; Heb 2:3-4 .
[96]  He died on the cross so that He could release the divine life John 12:24 and He resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b that He could impart the divine life through His death into God s chosen people.
[97]  One of the troubles with the Corinthians was the overemphasis of the speaking in tongues.
[98]  Speaking with new tongues is one of the five signs listed in Mark 16:17 and 18.
[99]  In the first chapter of Corinthians Paul says that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son v. 9 , who is God s power and God s wisdom to us v. 24 . Christ became wisdom to us from God as righteousness and sanctification and redemption v. 30 . First Corinthians unveils to us that the very Christ, who is the portion of all believers and into whose fellowship we all have been called, is all-inclusive.
[100]  He told the Corinthians clearly that to speak in tongues does not build the church but prophecy does v. 4 . Paul encouraged the saints in Corinth to prophesy, to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and to speak Christ.
[101]  What God is mainly doing in the age of grace is to reveal His Son in us Gal 1:16a that His Son may live in us Gal 2:20a , that His Son may be formed in us Gal 4:19 , and that we may be clothed with His Son Gal 3:27 .
[102]  The good word of God in 6:5 refers to the word of the beginning of the Christ mentioned in 6:1, which is the milk the Hebrew believers tasted when they believed in the Lord.
[103]  Hebrews 5:12 says, For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what are the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God, and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food.
[104]  Many of us are familiar with the word of life and the word of grace, but I do not think many Christians have a thought concerning the word of righteousness.
[105]  From the point of our regeneration in the Lord we began to know the word of life Phil 2:16 , the word of grace Acts 20:32 , the word of the truth Eph 1:13 , and the word of the gospel Acts 15:7 .
[106]  To merely tell people in preaching the gospel that Christ was the Son of God who died on the cross for sinners is to preach the good word of God referring to Christ s ministry on this earth.
[107]  Now they must go on from the good word of God to the deeper word, the word of righteousness 5:13 , which is not mainly concerned with God s redemption but with the way of His economy, and which is the solid food for them to reach maturity 6:1 .
[108]  Therefore, the book of Hebrews was written to bring the Hebrew believers on from the good word of God concerning Christ s earthly ministry to the word of righteousness concerning His heavenly ministry, from the first, initial stage of God s salvation to the full stage of God s salvation.
[109]  In the book of Acts miracles followed the apostles preaching of the gospel.
[110]  Eventually, in the book of Acts, though, there is a strong indication that the miracles were waning.
[111]  The miracles, including tongue-speaking do not belong to the word of righteousness but are listed with the good word of God, the word of the beginning of the Christ, which is in the kindergarten stage of the Christian life.
[112]  Paul s burden in the book of Hebrews was to bring the believers out of the kindergarten stage and to bring them on to maturity, to the word of righteousness concerning Christ s heavenly ministry, concerning the way of His economy, which is the solid food for them to reach maturity.
[113]  In the New Testament age God s main work is to bring forth the new creation, and the new creation work is based upon regeneration in our spirit by God s divine life, not by any miracle.
[114]  From the time of regeneration, God continues to renew us, to sanctify us dispositionally, to transform us from one degree of glory to another degree of glory, and eventually to conform us to the image of the firstborn Son of God unto glorification.
[115]  I do hope that all the churches would practice the small home meetings.
[116]  This does not mean that we should annul the big meetings, the general gathering of the whole church, on the Lord s day morning.
[117]  I feel we still need that meeting, but we should try our best not to practice in the old way of only one or two gifted brothers speaking, with the other saints only sharing a little bit.
[118]  God s way is for His children to be gathered into the Lord s name in mutuality in speaking.
[119]  FULL-TIME WORKERS The Need of More Full-Time Workers
[120]  The Lord s recovery is in need of more full-time workers.
[121]  Throughout the years in the United States, we did not promote this, yet a good number of brothers were raised up by the Lord to take the full-time way.
[122]  On the one hand, I encourage so many of you to go full-time; but on the other hand, I would advise you that if you go this way, you only have the right to tell your need to the Lord and your poverty.
