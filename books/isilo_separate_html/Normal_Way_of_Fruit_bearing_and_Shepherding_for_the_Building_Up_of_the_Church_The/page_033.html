<p>The experience of Christ is for the church. Satan is subtle. He may allow us to care for the experience of life, but he would not allow us to properly care for the church. Many times we are foolish in the way we present the church to people. In serving food, we need to know the right time to serve a certain kind of dish. However, most of us do not know whether the church is the main dish, an appetizer, or the dessert. We often flow like the tide. When we are at &ldquo;high tide,&rdquo; we damage people by making the church to be everything, but once we realize what we have done, we are at &ldquo;low tide&rdquo; and stay away from the matter of the church. God&rsquo;s economy is altogether for the church, but in his subtlety Satan has been and still is deceiving the saints concerning the church. Now we must be clear about the church, and we must know how to fight the battle for the church. With some of the dear ones, we should not speak concerning the church too quickly, but with others, now is the time to tell them about the church. We need to be the good doctors, knowing the right time to administer the dose. To minister concerning the church to the people under our care is not easy. Even if we are able to help people in the experience of Christ as life, if we cannot bring them into the proper church life, we are still short of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee fought this battle for years. I observed him for twenty years, from 1932 to the time he was arrested in 1952. In those twenty years he did not receive even one invitation from a denomination. This is because he was absolutely for the church. Today the subtle enemy is doing his best to allow Christians to use Brother Nee&rsquo;s books on life while hiding what he said about the church. Brother Nee pointed out to us that God&rsquo;s light was with us in those days simply because we were on God&rsquo;s way. If we had been off of God&rsquo;s way, we would have lost the right angle to see the light. The light comes from the direction of God&rsquo;s way. Many denominational leaders asked, &ldquo;Why does that &lsquo;little flock&rsquo; always receive light? When they open to any page of the Bible, light comes out. Why did we not see the light first instead of receiving it from them?&rdquo; Brother Nee&rsquo;s secret was that he was on the Lord&rsquo;s way and direction. However, although he always had the light, he suffered persecution. If Brother Nee were here today in the United States, he would be the biggest target of opposition. Many of his appraisers would turn into opposers.</p>
<p>We are here not for any other testimony; we are here for the testimony of the church. This is a real battle. How much we are able to minister to people concerning the church life depends on how much we have experienced. We need to know the reality, ground, history, and destiny of the church. All these require us to learn and to have a certain amount of experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP OTHERS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up the Members in Their Function</h2>
<p>We must all know how to build up the church. We should not be too proud and think that only we can build up others, nor should we be too humble and think that only others can build us up. We need to be built up, and we need to build up others. The genuine building up of the church includes several items. First, to build up the church we must help people to function. This is a great need, because without functioning there is no building up. In Christianity there is not much real building; there is mainly organization. We need to help people to function so that they may be built up. If someone never takes the opportunity to function in the church life, he can never be built into the church. He needs us to build him up in his function. This is a part of our shepherding.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up Others in Daily Gospel Preaching</h2>
<p>For the building up of the church, we also need the proper daily gospel preaching. This is why we must emphasize this matter. This should not be something that we merely give messages about. It must be something that we all get into, and we must build up others in this. This is the responsibility not only of the elders but of all of us. We all need to be built up in the daily gospel life. Then we can build up others in this way. This is a difficult job, but it is crucial to the building up of the church.</p>
<p>In the past, certain Christian groups had a certain amount of spirituality, but due to their lack of a gospel-preaching life, many of those groups came to nothing. They became like old people without children. Even in the human life, it makes a great difference whether we have children, especially as we grow older. In order to have a proper life, we all need children. In the church life, we need a daily addition of new believers. If one new believer were added to the church each day, we would all be very living. On the other hand, if not one new believer is added to the church in six months, the whole church life will decline. This would indicate that we are wrong, and in this condition it will be impossible to have a proper church life. Whether we have new ones is a test to our church life, indicating clearly whether we are hot or cold. We need a gospel-preaching daily life. This does not require us to do nothing but zealously preach the gospel day and night. Instead, we simply need to help the saints to be built up in their daily gospel preaching.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
