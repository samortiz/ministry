   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TEN GOD'S PROCEDURES TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous messages we have covered the first main point of the book of Genesis the desire and purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was revealed in Genesis 1:1 2:3.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's desire and purpose are to have a corporate man to express Him in His image and to represent Him with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we must ask a question: how can man express God in His image and represent Him with His authority?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This brings us to the second main point of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. God's Procedures to Fulfill</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His Purpose 2:4-7</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis chapter 2 reveals the way God uses to accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why we have the second record of creation in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I was a young Christian, I was troubled by these two records of the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Genesis 1 provided us a record of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why do we need another record in Genesis 2?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was not until the later days of my ministry that God showed me the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the record of creation in Genesis 1 reveals God's purpose in creating man, it does not show us the way to fulfill this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we need the second record to reveal the way, the procedure, God takes to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After seeing the purpose in chapter 1, we must come to see the procedure in chapter 2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This procedure is fully revealed in Genesis 2, starting with verse 5 and continuing through the end of the chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we read this portion of the Word in the light of the whole Bible, we will see that this procedure is of three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can only cover one step in this message, leaving the remaining two steps for subsequent messages.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, before we consider the first step, we want to point out that the means by which God fulfills His purpose is life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By Life</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is going to accomplish His purpose by means of His own life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can one person express another if he does not have that person's life?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A dog cannot express a cat because a dog does not have a cat's life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A dog has a dog's life, and this life is only suitable for expressing a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the same principle, a cat can never express a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we think otherwise, we are dreaming.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can we human beings express God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no way except by having the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a dog is to express a cat, there must be a way to inject the cat's life into the dog.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once a dog has received a cat's life, it will be easy for it spontaneously to become the expression of a cat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man is destined to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are we able to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is impossible for us to do it by our life because it is simply a human life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our life is too low to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we are going to express God, we need the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have the life of God, we will express Him spontaneously and unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we have His life, we will express His image.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Life is the way to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This life is not our natural life, but the divine and eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Authority is also related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Neither a table nor a chair has authority, for authority is always related to a certain life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more life you have, the more authority you have.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Human beings have authority over the animals because we have more life than the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even in the area of human relationships we find it true that the more life a person has the more authority he has.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I am more mature than you, I have authority over you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a teenager comes to me, there is no need for me to threaten him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He spontaneously will come under my authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This authority was not given to me by the President of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It came from my age.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you are 110 years of age and I am 70, I will come under your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your age assigns you the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to represent God with His authority, we need His life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you are to represent a certain person in society, you need to possess a life that is nearly the same as his.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose you are invited to represent the President of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You need to have the same amount of life as he.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If your life is rather low, you will be unable to represent him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The standard of your life must match the life of the President.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the basic and logical principle that we must care for: we can never express God or represent God by our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Consider your life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Your life is incapable of expressing God; it is only adequate to express yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To a certain extent, a woman is not even qualified in life to represent her husband, because her life is not as high as her husband's. I wonder if the sisters agree with this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At any rate, we all must admit that our natural life disqualifies us from expressing God and representing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Not only is our fallen life inadequate for this, but even the created life we had at the beginning was inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As we shall see in the next message, this was the reason God, after creating man, placed him in front of the tree of life, indicating that man needed to possess a higher life than he already had.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some people may ask, "Didn't God create us in His image?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yes, God did create us in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then these people may say, "Since we already have God's image, why can't we express Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may say that the man created in the image of God resembles the photograph of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Suppose you take a photograph of Brother John and show it to others saying that this is Brother John.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In a sense, you are correct, for that is Brother John.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, the photograph is not the real Brother John; it is Brother John in a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although the picture reveals the features, style, and the person of Brother John, it does not have the life of Brother John.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It can show something of Brother John, but it cannot express him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The only way for the photograph to express Brother John is for it to have his life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Man was created in the image of God, but he was like a photograph showing something of God without having the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although man was in the image of God, he did not have the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God intended that man should partake of the life indicated by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Man failed to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Today, by believing in Christ, we have been brought back to share in that life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We all have received eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Thus, there is no other way for us to express God in His image and to represent God with His authority except by sharing His life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is confirmed by many verses in the Bible.</S>
