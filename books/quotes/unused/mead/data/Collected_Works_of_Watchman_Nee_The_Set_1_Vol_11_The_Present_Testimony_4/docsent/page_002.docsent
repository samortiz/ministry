   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE Issue No. 32</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Jesus is Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 Cor 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have previously held two conferences of the same nature, one in February of 1928 and one in October of 1931.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The conference held in November of last year was of a different nature, and for that reason we consider the upcoming conference to be the third overcomer conference.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I want all the brothers to understand the nature of this type of conference; no attention will be paid to the less significant matters of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we want to see in the Holy Spirit is Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matters such as prophecy, church organization, Scripture exposition, types, baptism, laying on of hands, speaking in tongues, miracles, and a hundred other questions have their proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As Christians we should not deny them their proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, these are neither the center of the Scriptures nor the center of the life of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has only one center, which is Christ Christ and Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our annual conferences of this nature are to bring us back to this center.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we are reluctant to mention any minor matters in these conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, we would emphasize only the central point which God Himself stressed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people often ask us why The Present Testimony does not print some of the articles similar to those in the previous magazine, The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, they do not realize that The Present Testimony only delivers the central message of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of the gospel messages, interpretations of prophecy, Bible expositions, and answers to questions are not God's center.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a pity that many believers treasure our writings on these side issues, but neglect the central message.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are not saying that the other subjects are useless; they do have their place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, they are not the center.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a person has not laid hold of God's center, all these truths will only be doctrines to him and will not give him any help.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Knowing God in His center, and living in the center is victory, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everything else follows afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our conference this time, as before, we wish to lay stress on the central message.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After much prayer I feel the theme which the Lord has given me for this conference is "God's Overcomers."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everything in the conference will focus on this center.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the dates are now set, I ask all the brothers to pray more for this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Unlike the conference in 1928, our conferences in 1931 and 1932 were both lacking in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consequently, we saw no obvious blessing in those meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should, therefore, ask God for a burden to pray and for a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to pray and pray fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps we even have to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we must pray in the Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether or not God will bless us depends upon our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Finally, in this conference, our hope is to meet Christ, to receive light and revelation from heaven, and to be filled with the life that is unknown to ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not intend to pay attention to the many minor, outward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"To know Him" Phil 3:10 this is what we seek.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>December 13, 1933</S>
