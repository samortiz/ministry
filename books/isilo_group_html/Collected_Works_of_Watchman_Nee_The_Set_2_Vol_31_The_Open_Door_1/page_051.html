O. Box 84, Hankow, March 1938)</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">The Work in the Remote Regions,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>To the brothers who have been called together in grace:</p><p>We had a week-long special gospel conference beginning February 7 at two o'clock every afternoon in the meeting place of the local church in K'un-ming (next door to the Tung Hsing Pharmacy, Tung-Ren Street). I was responsible for it, but Brothers Chou Kang-yao, Chou Hung-bao, Chang Jing-yuan, and Chen Hsi-wen all helped quite a bit. The Lord did a great work for the sake of His honorable name. Many people desired the Lord's word and came forward with enthusiasm. The brothers and sisters were busy bringing friends and relatives to the meetings, and everyone was very living. Every day the audience filled the hall to overflowing. There were not enough chairs, so new chairs had to be added. The only exception was on the twelfth, when it rained and the audience was slightly smaller. The Holy Spirit did a marvelous work, and most of the audience was touched. After the meeting the brothers and sisters prayed for those who wanted to receive the Lord. They also spoke personally with those who still did not dare to believe in the Lord, exhorting and encouraging them. The number of those who received salvation eventually became quite large. The last day saw the greatest number in attendance. We could see God's blessing from beginning to end. The Lord willing, we will have several special edification meetings beginning Thursday evening. This will render a group of lambs more understanding concerning the truth they must believe and the road they must walk after salvation. Many brothers and sisters are ready to be baptized into the Lord's name. May the Lord increase His work in the future by saving more sinners into the local churches to glorify His great name. We hope that the brothers and sisters in the Lord will not forget to help us through prayer.</p><p>Brothers Hsu Jung-jieh and Hu Yi-min are still working in Yeh-Ji. (I heard that Mrs. Hsu had a baby girl on January 19.)</p><p>Sisters Yu Su-jen and Rachel Lee arrived safely in K'un-ming on the fifteenth of the month. When they arrived at Ho-Kou, they had no trouble entering the territory because they were helped by Brother Chen Ho-sheng. They arrived at Ho-Kou one day and were able to leave the very next day. It was very different from my first time of coming to Ho-Kou. Brother Ho-sheng's job transfer to Ho-Kou certainly was the Lord's good arrangement. I hope that a local church will be built up there also. Brother Chou Hung-bao was sick with an intestinal infection, but thank the Lord for hearing the prayers of the brothers and sisters. He is completely well now, and he is able to go out to help with the work. I have heard that he will go to Luh-Liang (in the eastern part of Yunnan, about two or three days from K'un-ming) to work next month.</p><p>Brother Chou Kang-yao and his wife are temporarily doing some work for the Lord in the Hwei Tien Hospital. I have heard that the director of the hospital is very much in one accord with us concerning the matter of furthering the gospel in the hospital. He welcomes the brothers and sisters preaching the gospel to the nurses and patients. I have heard that Brother Chou will work in Chu-Jing in the near future.</p><p>Sister Chen Huei-sien is still in K'un-ming doing much individual gospel preaching and visiting. Her burden is still for the countryside, and if the Lord wills, she will go with Brother Chou to Luh-Liang.</p><p>Sister Hsiao Ru-chuan and an elderly sister, who loves the Lord, went to work in Mong-Tze, Lin-An (southern Yunnan) and Shi-Ping on the fourteenth of the month. Sister Hsiao is from Shao-Wu in the north of Fukien and has been working for the Lord in Yunnan for years. She has read The Christian and the other publications of the Gospel Book Room for years. Since the church in K'un-ming was established, she has voluntarily taken a stand with us based on the scriptural ground of the church.</p><p>As for my own work, I plan to go work in Mong-Tze, Jien-Shui, and Shi-Ping if the Lord wills. All of these places are in the southern part of Yunnan. Later, if the Chou brothers go to work in Chu-Jing, I will go and work with them for awhile. Thank the Lord, He has opened a door for us to preach the gospel in Ning-Er and Meng-Ke (in the southwestern part of Yunnan). My old classmate, Chen Jao-fang (a believer also), is in Ning-Er where he is working in the field of health. A Western sister of whom I have spoken before, Sister Hai, is in Meng-Ke. She is preaching the gospel there. If the Lord allows, I will also go there to preach the gospel.</p><p>The most difficult thing about the work in the interior of Yunnan province is the traveling. One must walk most of the way, ride a horse, or ride in a sedan chair. There are bandits in some areas who appear and disappear on and off and cause trouble. I hope that the brothers and sisters will pray more for the work in the remote regions and also pray that I would have the utterance to be able to boldly speak the mysteries of the gospel (Eph. 6:19). Peace to you!</p><p>Your brother,<br />K. H.
