   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE FULL GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO THE HEAVENLY VISION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these messages of the young people s training we all must see a heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need God s unique vision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Acts 26:19 Paul said, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we shall see, the background of this heavenly vision was the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE REVELATION OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This background was present in Matthew 16, where we have a revelation of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus did not come to the heathen, pagan world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He came to God s people, a people who had the holy Scriptures, who worshipped in God s temple, and who offered the sacrifices according to God s divine regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These people were very scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>None of the first followers of the Lord Jesus were pagans.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They all were religious people who had a background in the Scriptures, in the worship of God, in God s law, and in the general knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suddenly, the Lord Jesus appeared and called some of them, and they followed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day, the Lord took His disciples into the parts of Caesarea Philippi Matt 16:13 , far away from the temple and the holy city, to the border of the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After bringing them there, He asked them a question: Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matt 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After the disciples gave some answers, the Lord said, But whom say ye that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matt 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why did the Lord ask them this question in the parts of Caesarea Philippi ?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fact that the Lord took His disciples there strongly implies and indicates that He is absolutely different from the typical religion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus is the living Christ, the living Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is not a part of dead religion; He is altogether different from religion and stands outside of it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The revelation of Christ as the Son of the living God was not given in the sphere, in the realm, of the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord brought the disciples away from everything holy away from the holy land, the holy city, and the holy temple.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord seemed to be saying, You may think that all these things are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But I shall forsake them all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who want to follow Me must come away from the background of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With this as the background, Peter answered the Lord s question by saying, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God Matt 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This word was not a teaching or a tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was a direct revelation from the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It did not derive from the Jewish religion, the holy temple, or the holy city, but was something fresh and new.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It did not originate with human thought or religious concepts; it came directly from the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After Peter spoke these words, the Lord said, I say also unto thee, That thou art a stone and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it Matt 16:18, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>. Here we see Christ, the Son of the living God, and the church built upon Him as the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, in this chapter we have Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although it is wonderful to see Christ, this is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also must see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is only the rock, but the church is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 18 says that the gates of Hades will not prevail against the church, and in verse 19 the Lord said, And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we see the gates of Hades on the negative side and the kingdom of heaven on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ and the church will bring in the kingdom of God and will cast down and defeat the gates of Hades, the authority of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the heavenly vision concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The vision that Christ and the church will bring in God s kingdom and defeat the kingdom of Satan is given outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not a matter of culture, ethics, or morality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, it is the very Christ, the Son of the living God, with the church to bring in the kingdom of the heavens and to subdue the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all must see this.</S>
