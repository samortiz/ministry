   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Each of the twelve verses listed above in the Scripture reading contains an extract.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These twelve verses may be divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first six verses tell us what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 9:5 says that Christ is God, who is above all and blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Timothy 2:5 says that Christ is man, while 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Christ is wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life, and Ephesians 3:8 says that Christ is One who is unsearchably rich.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The latter six verses give us the way to experience and enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Galatians 2:20 says that Christ lives in us, and 4:19 says that Christ is being formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Philippians 1:20 Christ will be magnified, as always, in our body, and in verse 21a for us to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Philippians 3:8 speaks of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord, and verse 10a refers to knowing Christ and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are all very sweet experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among the human race, the Bible is a precious book that has its particular position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It has now been translated into many different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In human history, there have not been as many books written about any science, theory, or other topic as there have been about the Bible, a book that is truly comprehensive and exhaustive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For two thousand years there have been innumerable books discussing and interpreting the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible speaks not only of God but also of the origin and creation of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It covers astronomy and geography, as well as the beginning and destination of man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition, it covers human culture, the conditions among the human race, and everything pertaining to human life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In it we can find science, philosophy, history, and prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By this we can see that the Bible is truly a comprehensive book.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The most particular characteristic of the Bible is that it contains many indescribably sweet terms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In human society we cannot find another book that contains so many sweet terms, such as light, life, love, grace, righteousness, and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unfortunately, many Bible readers study the Bible according to their own inclination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who are inclined toward science study science in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who are inclined toward geology try to learn geology from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Confucius's disciples, who care for propriety and justice, discover ethics in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In their study of human history, those who love history must study the historical records in the Bible; otherwise, they cannot become experts in their field.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who study theology surely must scrutinize the Bible thoroughly because it contains many theological doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Throughout the generations many teachers of theology have studied the Bible devotedly and have written profusely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, what did God intend when He gave us the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Was it for us to study astronomy or geography?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Was it to research science, philosophy, or theology?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Did He intend to teach us history and ethics?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, why did God give us so many sweet terms in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have been saved for sixty years, and in these sixty years there has not been one day that I did not read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I also have been writing expositions of biblical truths for over fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After this year, I will have finished writing the notes on the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can say that not only do I have a general view of the Bible, but I have also studied the Bible in a penetrating and thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In these many years I have spoken a great deal on the crucial subjects in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have been constantly considering what this comprehensive Bible talks about and what its essence or extract is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I first went to Taiwan, I studied the Bible with the brothers and sisters every day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In one year we studied sixty topics, which are the sixty topics in The Fundamental Truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, after studying that many topics, eventually I have to admit that the extracts of the Bible are nothing other than these four items: Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the beginning is Christ, at the end is the church, and in the process are the Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These four items Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church constitute the biblical science as well as biblical philosophy, astronomy, geography, ethics, history, and theology.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everything spoken of in the Bible is for these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only Christ is the reality; He is the body of all things Col 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there is no Christ, there is no Spirit, and neither are there life and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there is Christ, there is reality and substance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is the Spirit, the Spirit is life, and life produces the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without Christ, there is no Spirit; without the Spirit, there is no life; and without life, there is no way to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, these four items are the extract, the cream, the essence, of the Bible.</S>
