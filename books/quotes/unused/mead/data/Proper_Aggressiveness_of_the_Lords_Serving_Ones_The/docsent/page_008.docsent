   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE LEARNING NEEDED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS TURNING FROM LARGER MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is making a turn in its practice from corporate meetings involving all the saints to meetings in small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Corporate meetings involving all the saints are suitable in a small locality with about one hundred saints, because they can meet the needs of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when the number in the meetings increases, the needs of the saints who are at different levels will be overlooked in meetings that involve all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though human beings tend to be gregarious, we live in households as the basic unit; we do not live in groups.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The strength of a country and the stability of its society depend on the household as its basic unit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the household unit is destroyed, a society becomes corrupted and the country is weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Breaking Bread and Praying from House to House</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The principle is the same with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the church the household is the basic unit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were saved Acts 2:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These new believers gathered in the temple and broke bread and prayed from house to house vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>42, 46 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They needed to gather together so that the apostles could teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, this was not enough; there was still the need for the believers to break bread and have mutual fellowship and prayer in their homes, that is, from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By the end of chapter 5 the small gatherings in the homes were not only for the breaking of bread and prayer but also for announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ v. 42 . They announced the Lord Jesus as the gospel from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Chapter 20 reveals that during Paul s three years in Ephesus, he declared the counsel of God to the Ephesians publicly and also entreated and admonished them from house to house vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>18-20, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Based on these verses, after a local church increases, it must take the household unit as its base.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have neglected this for the past twenty years and have suffered a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, we have preached the gospel, baptized people, and led many to salvation, but on the other hand, not many of these have remained.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The root cause is that we neglected the matter of the household as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Church history and world history show that the existence of any large group is based on small units within the group.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the church in Taipei must have a great turn from corporate meetings involving all the saints to small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Other than having a need for an administrative government, the small group should function according to all the other aspects of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Taking Care of Four Matters</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Teaching, Shepherding, Care, and Support</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether a local church is strong or weak depends on how the church takes care of teaching, shepherding, caring for, and supporting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a local church takes care of these four matters, it will be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can the elders take care of these four items in a large local church?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, thirty elders would not be able to take care of these four matters in the church in Taipei, where there are three thousand people who meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At most, the elders could gather the saints into meetings and give them messages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this only takes care of teaching, and even this teaching cannot be thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The elders would be unable to shepherd, care for, and support all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we did not take care of these matters in the past, all the ones saved through us either died or were adopted by others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we want our children to grow up in the homes, there should be shepherding, care, and support at home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Having Many Small Groups</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>but Still Being One Church with One Eldership</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are raising up the small groups so that we can make up the lack in shepherding, care, and support.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The co-workers and elders in Taipei must realize that the building up of the church is entirely dependent on the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the small groups there should be teaching, shepherding, care, and support.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This does not mean that there is absolutely no administration or management in the small groups, but the need for this is not great.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The life pulse of a small group is in teaching, shepherding, care, and support.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can no longer follow our old ways; in other words, we have changed our administrative system.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, this does not mean that we do not need elders; neither does it mean that every home should be regarded as a church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is wrong to say that every home is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Someone said that as long as there are a few believers meeting in a home, that home is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He spoke this based on Paul s word in the Epistles concerning the church in a person s house cf.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rom 16:5; 1 Cor 16:19; Col 4:15; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>2 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But this is a mistaken view.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The believers in Jerusalem met from house to house, but Acts 8:1 refers to the church which was in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to the original Greek, church here is singular, implying one church in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There were many home meetings in Jerusalem, but they were one church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to the record in Acts, there was only one group of elders in the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, Barnabas and Paul handed the material offering to the elders in the church in Jerusalem 11:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In chapter 15 when a problem arose in the churches, Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem to see the elders and the apostles v. 2 . This proves that a large church with thousands of believers meeting in numerous homes is still one church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this way, the oneness of the Body of Christ in each locality is kept.</S>
