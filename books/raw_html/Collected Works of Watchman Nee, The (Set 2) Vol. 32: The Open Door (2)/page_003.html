<h2 class="head2">Ku-Jiu and Mong-Tze, Yunnan Province</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>Since Brother Weigh and Brother Chen returned to K'un-ming, I have conducted a few Bible studies with the brothers and sisters in Shi-Ping concerning the subject "Standing Fast in the Lord." The church in Shi-Ping has been suffering some disturbance lately. Thank the Lord that the disturbance taught His children some lessons. On May 13 I went to Ku-Jiu for the second time and conducted a seven-day Bible study. Because of the rain, we could not engage in any outdoor evangelistic work. During the day, we did some personal visitations. The railway company here has a Mr. Wong and Mr. Fung, who have become desirous of the truth as a result of Brother Kung's testimony. A group of brothers who are materially poor have been dealt with in the matter of life. Now they are reading the Bible and praying in the house of Brother Ruan. On the twenty-third of this month, I went by train to Mong-Tze, and I will spend a week for the work here. In the daytime I preach outdoors, and in the evening I have Bible study meetings in a Gospel Chapel. (This chapel was rented by a few believers who have invited me to use their place.) Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Kwang-tsao<br />May 25 at 28 Da-Jing Street, Mong-Tze</p><h2 class="head2">Returning from Jien-Shui to Shi-Ping,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>On May 30, after returning from Mong-Tze to Shi-Ping, I conducted a few more days of Bible studies. Later, because of my burden for Jien-Shui, I left Shi-Ping and went there. Prior to my arrival, Brother Kung in Ku-Jiu asked the midwife of the Jien-Shui Health Clinic, Miss Kuo Chia-ai, to recommend a place for me to stay. After my arrival, it was recommended that I stay in the guard house of a mansion. I felt an unspeakable pressure upon me as if I were sick. The guards were talking about bandits who had raided the city the previous day at a location not far from where I lodged. I wanted to go home. Suddenly, I felt that I should pray, and I rejected all these thoughts in the name of the Lord. Thank the Lord that He released me. Later, I visited Miss Kuo (a member of a Methodist church) and met with the director of the clinic, Mr. Chou Je-min (a native of Anhwei province and an Episcopalian). He was willing to give me an opportunity to conduct a Bible study in his clinic. The first night I preached the gospel at the guard house. The second night we moved to the department building. We had a Bible study every evening until the thirteenth. As soon as we awakened some to seek after the Lord, people came from Mong-Tze and spoke to Director Chou for the purpose of chasing us away. Thank the Lord that Chou was not affected, and we conducted another Bible study on the fifteenth. On the sixteenth we returned to Shi-Ping. I really hope that the Lord will send you to work together with me in Yi-Nan. Please pray for us.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Kwang-tsao<br />May 17 in Shi-Ping</p><h2 class="head2">In Luh-Liang, About to Go to Chu-Jing,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brother Chou Hung-bao was led by God last month to work in a place in Yi-Dung called Luh-Liang (bringing along his family). Sister Chen Hwei-sien went along also. While they were on their way late one night, God miraculously led them through the dark night by the illumination of lightning. Brother Chou said that he had never in his life felt the lightning to be as precious as on that night. They arrived at a little inn a little past nine, and rain began to pour down heavily after supper. In Luh-Liang God prepared a nice house for them with eight rooms upstairs and downstairs. The monthly rent was only three dollars. We are told that the people here are very desirous of the Lord's Word. Recently the postmaster and his wife received the Lord. Thank the Lord that He has opened the door for preaching.</p><p>Brother Chou Kang-yao and his wife will soon work in Chu-Jing. Recently there was a Mr. Chou in K'un-ming who was an instructor in the Air Force. He hurt his leg and was hospitalized in Hwi-Dian Hospital. Through Brother Chou Kang-yao's preaching, God saved him during his three months of suffering. On September 16 he was baptized into Christ. His testimony moved many. He said that if God wanted him to be a preacher, he was willing to do so. May the Lord personally lead him on in the way ahead.</p><p>Hwang Tsung<br />June 18, Customs Department, K'un-ming, Yunnan</p>
