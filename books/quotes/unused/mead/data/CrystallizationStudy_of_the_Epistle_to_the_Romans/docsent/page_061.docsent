   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TWO STATUSES OF CHRIST S SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ as the Son of God has two statuses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. The Only Begotten Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the only begotten Son of God John 1:18 , possessing the divine nature, divinity, from eternity to eternity Psa 90:2; Rom 9:5 as the Second in the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. The Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is also the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 , possessing both the divine nature and the human nature divinity and humanity from His resurrection through His ascension and His second coming to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the firstborn Son of God beginning from and not earlier than His resurrection Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The firstborn Son of God had not come into being before Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Matthew 26:64 the high priest asked the Lord Jesus if He was the Son of God, but He answered with the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said that when He comes back, He will be the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From the time of His resurrection, all of Christ s activity is not as the only begotten Son of God, but as the firstborn Son of God in both His divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So in Christ s ascension He is still the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both Stephen and the apostle John saw this Acts 7:55-56; Rev 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His first coming He was God s only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His second coming He will be the Firstborn Heb 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For eternity He will be the Son of Man John 1:51 and note 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Christians do not realize this deeper truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They would agree that Christ is both God and man, but they might feel that Christ was no longer a man after His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Unconsciously, they may think that Christ was a man only for the thirty-three and a half years from His incarnation to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Joseph from Arimathea took the body of Jesus and he and Nicodemus bound it in linen cloths and laid it in a new tomb John 19:38-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the morning of Christ s resurrection, Peter and John saw the linen cloths lying there in the tomb and the handkerchief which had been over His head folded up in one place apart 20:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ s body was gone because His body had been resurrected by being transformed from His humanity into His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you say Christ was a man only for thirty-three and a half years, then I would ask, Where is His body today?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible tells us that when He resurrected, He left only the linen cloths and the handkerchief in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did not leave His body there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His body was resurrected by being transformed from His humanity into His divinity, and that transformation was God s begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God begot Him in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All these are the deep details in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After this fellowship, I hope that you will be made very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ s humanity was put on in His incarnation, but this humanity was transformed, begotten by God, from His humanity into His divinity in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So today He is still the Son of Man, not in the original human form, but in the transformed, divine form.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In resurrection we were regenerated with Him, but we were not transformed with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When He comes, He will transform, or transfigure, our body into His glorious body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is the firstborn Son of God among the many sons of God, His many brothers, who are God s many sons Rom 8:29, 19; Heb 2:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Question: At what point did Christ s divinity become mingledwith His humanity?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Was it in incarnation or resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Answer: From incarnation to resurrection Christ was God and man, and this man and God were one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But at that time the mingling had not been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The mingling was consummated by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before resurrection His humanity was not brought into His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The mingling of God with man was completed by resurrection.</S>
