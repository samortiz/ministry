   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many brothers and sisters have prayed for their daily living, parents, children, and own spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But have they prayed for this matter before?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we do not believe that the world is evil, how can we pray for deliverance from the world?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who would pray for deliverance from sin when his heart loves sin?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Who would not want to strike a fortune when his heart is for money?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Beseeching God to deliver us from these things is to acknowledge that all these things are vanity and that the coming tribulation is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why there is the prayer, "God, save me from the coming tribulation."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May we all have such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Stand before the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the original language, this phrase can be translated "be made worthy to be placed before the Son of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, it is not a question of grace but a question of work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether or not one will be raptured is a question of worthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are a person who is watching at every time and beseeching, God will consider you worthy of being placed before the Son of Man; you will be considered worthy of being raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is it to be worthy?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God cannot take you to a place where you do not want to go.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people do not want to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Heaven would be a place of suffering to them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In heaven one will have to pray, read the Bible, and sing forever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How tiring that will be!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In heaven there will not be all the amusements.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How dull that will be!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people are not spiritual and heavenly enough to be raptured to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is a fable that says that an eagle once found a cat and told him how wonderful the sky is and how wonderful the sun, moon, and snow on the mountaintop are.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The cat said, "I only ask one thing: Are there mice in the sky?'"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there were no mice, nothing would be attractive to the cat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If all that a Christian thinks about is children, money, position, and fame, he would have no interest in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he is not zealous for the Lord, and finds all the heavenly things dull, he cannot blame God for not being gracious to him, for he will have no heart for heaven and will not want it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Last summer a brother was preaching that the whole church would be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I asked him, "Are there saved Christians who watch movies?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said yes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I then asked, "Are there saved Christians who commit fornication?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said yes again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I then asked, "Suppose when the Lord comes back, these ones are watching movies or committing fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Will they be raptured?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they will be raptured, what kind of doctrine is this?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord said that these kind of people are not worthy to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being raptured is a matter of being worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we hold onto the things of the earth, God will not take us away against our will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, a helium balloon goes up by itself, but if a piece of stone is tied to it, it will not ascend.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the rapture does not depend on whether or not one has life but on whether or not one's heart is free from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord says, "Lest perhaps your hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and the anxieties of life" v. 34 . It is a question of the things that are holding down one's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 36 shows us clearly that the whole church will neither escape the tribulation, nor go through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord gives us a promise here: whoever is watching at every time and beseeching will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If no one will pass through the tribulation, there would be no need for this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If everyone will pass through the tribulation, this verse will not be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is because of the possibility of a rapture before the tribulation that there is such a promise from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Otherwise, of what use is this verse?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our friends say that "all these things which are about to happen" v. 36 does not refer to the great tribulation but to the debauchery, drunkenness, and anxieties of life mentioned in verse 34.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They say that as long as a Christian can watch at every time and beseech, God will deliver him from such things as debauchery and drunkenness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But they leave out the words "which are about to happen."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Are the things in verse 34 things that are here today, or are they things that are about to happen?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The debauchery, drunkenness, and anxieties of life are all things of today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They are things that people need to be delivered from today.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How can one wait until the future to be delivered from them?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, the deliverance from these things is not a matter of worthiness; a person should be delivered from these things in any case as long as they are here.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, "all these things which are about to happen" in verse 36 refers to the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These things which are about to happen are not here today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>From this verse, we can see that the theory of the whole church passing through the tribulation is unfounded, for the Lord clearly promises "that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I will only mention these two major proofs.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At least in Revelation 3:10 and Luke 21:36, the Bible shows us that some saints will not pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The verses we read in the last message say that saints will pass through the tribulation, whereas the verses we read in this message say that there is a way out.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Generally speaking, the church will pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the verses we read today say that a minority of believers will be raptured before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we read Matthew 25 carefully, we will see that the five prudent virgins are believers, and the five foolish virgins are also believers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who are raptured are believers, and those who are left behind are also believers.</S>
