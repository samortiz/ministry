   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRINCIPLE OF ABSALOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Absalom was David's son.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>David was his authority; yet he stole men to himself to listen to his judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He attracted men to himself and usurped his father's authority 2 Sam 15:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He wanted to be appointed king and wanted others to see that he could be a better king than his father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As far as his position was concerned, Absalom was in line to the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet he tried to usurp the throne by his own method.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The principle of Absalom was the principle of rebellion; he did not want to subject himself to the authority of David; he tried to establish his own authority instead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being an authority means to submit to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only those who submit to authority can be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Absalom's principle was a deadly one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He tried to usurp authority and assume the kingship by his own flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He rebelled against David's authority and attempted to establish his own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the end he was rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Anyone who tries to assume authority by himself is a rebellious Absalom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His end will be God's sure rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever a man tries to be an authority, he is saying that he does not want God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Absalom did not care for God to establish him as the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result, God did not appoint him as the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>David was a man who willingly gave up his own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Absalom we see the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason David found favor in God's sight while Absalom was rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Absalom did a fine job when he judged the people at the gate of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In man's eyes he was a good judge, but his goal was to usurp authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God does not want man to be motivated by ambition for authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a man craves being an authority, he will end up either in death or rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the principle of Absalom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we move to a place and find someone who wants to be an authority, we should not allow him to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is different from aspiring for overseership and desiring a good work in 1 Timothy 3:1.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should totally eradicate the ambition for authority within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should loathe the desire to rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unless we are free from these thoughts, we are not worthy of God's trust.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If our mind is set on being an authority, we do not know the meaning of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to learn to submit to authority from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everyone who murmurs and complains does not know authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only submissive ones find others submitting to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only an obedient man can lead others to a knowledge of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the world an authority commands respect and admiration from others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the spiritual realm it is altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the world only certain kinds of people can be an authority; they have to act certain ways.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, the principal of a school has to act like a principal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the spiritual realm, however, an authority does not walk around in pomp and pretense; rather, he is a submissive man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The honor of the high priest is not upon a person himself, but it is given by God Heb 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more submissive a person is, the less he will conduct himself with pomp and pretense outwardly and the less he is likely to become an object of obedience to others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet these are the ones who can bring others to submission.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is absolutely different from the way of worldly authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not here to inspire men to submit to men but to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE LORD JESUS' SUBMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Consider the pattern of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Philippians 2:8 says that the Lord was obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord's humbling of Himself was something beyond human imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is hard to fathom such obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In verse 5 Paul says that we should let "this mind" be in us, which was also in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The whole passage concerns taking the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"This mind" is a mind that becomes "obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross" v. 8 . Having the mind of Christ is to have a mind that will obey even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This mind seeks every opportunity to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Son of God was in heaven; He was God, equal with God in rank, power, possession, and existence.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Obedience is not a necessity within the Godhead, because there is no distinction of rank, privilege, or greatness between the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As such, there is no need of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet when Christ came to the earth, He gave up all honor, power, position, and form, and became a common man, being obedient even as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One of the wonders of the universe is that Christ refused to return to the Father through the pathway of His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He returned instead through the pathway of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is like saying that even though man is able to walk on water across the sea, he insists on swimming across it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord "climbed" back to God through learning obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord had only one mind in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He was simple in His motive.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>From the beginning to the end His mind was set on obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He did not have any thought of gaining authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>During the thirty-three and a half years that He lived the human life, His mind was set on obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He did not become obedient by accident or as a result of favorable environment; He was obedient in His very mind.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was obedient everywhere and in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To have a mind of obedience means to actively seek for authority to come under.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord was always looking for God's will and to obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He said, "The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing" John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Son cannot initiate anything; He cannot act according to His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is to have a mind to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There may be obedient men on earth, but it is difficult to find a person who has a mind to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A person who has a mind to obey is one who seeks for opportunity to obey all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is fearful of losing any opportunity to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is a person bound by obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The thought of taking up any form of authority is nonexistent in him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>With some people obedience is conditional; they have ulterior motives in their obedience or they obey simply because it happens to fit their preference to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A man who has a mind to obey is different.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If a man has a mind to gain a place in public office, he will set his mind on using every opportunity to reach his goal.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This was how the Son was in His obedience; He was fearful that He would lose His chance for submission.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He sought for every opportunity to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>His mind was not set on being an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In order to establish authority, the Lord first established obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Without establishing obedience, He could never have established authority.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Therefore, Christ came and established God's authority through His obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The mind of Jesus of Nazareth was one that sought and reached out for obedience.</S>
