<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF DEUTERONOMY</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REHEARSAL OF THE LAW</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Deut. 11:8-32</H1><P>In this message we will consider the two aspects of the general advices and warnings found in 11:8-32.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. The Children of Israel<br>to Receive Blessings by Being Willing<br>to Keep Moses' Words of Advice and Warning</H2><P>In 11:8-25 we see that if the children of Israel were willing to keep Moses' words of advice and warning, they would receive certain blessings. Today, if we keep Christ, we will receive blessings from God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Being Strong and Going In<br>to Possess the Promised Land</H2><P>"Therefore you shall keep the whole commandment which I am commanding you today so that you may be strong and that you may go in and possess the land into which you are crossing over to possess it" (v. 8). If the children of Israel would keep the commandment, they would receive the blessing of being strong and of going in to possess the promised land. If we today keep Christ and hold fast to Christ, we will be strengthened and encouraged to go on to possess Christ. In Paul's words, we will be strengthened to "gain Christ" (Phil. 3:8). To possess Christ is to gain Him. The more we contact the Lord and enjoy Him, the more we are strengthened and encouraged to press on to gain Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Extending Their Days<br>upon the Promised Land</H2><P>If the children of Israel were willing to keep Moses' words, they would extend their days upon the promised land, a land flowing with milk and honey, a land which God cares for and upon which His eyes are from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year (Deut. 11:9-12). For us today, the promised land is Christ, and our days may be extended not upon Christ but in Christ and with Christ.</P><P>Deuteronomy 11:12 says, "It is a land which Jehovah your God cares for; always the eyes of Jehovah your God are upon it, from the beginning of the year unto the end of the year." Literally, the Hebrew word translated "cares for" means "seeks after" (i.e., with interest and care). This verse speaks not merely of God's affection but of His care. For God's eyes to be upon us means that we are the object of His care. The reason that God puts His eyes upon us is so that we will hold fast to Christ and enjoy Christ.</P><P>First, God sets His affection upon us (7:7), and then He puts His eyes upon us. Since His eyes are upon us all the time, from the beginning of the year unto the end of the year, we can see His eyes and thereby enjoy His presence. How dear and precious is this blessing!</P>
