   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE PRESENCE OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RESURRECTED CHRIST Scripture Reading: Matthew 28</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the Book of Matthew is clearly a book concerning Christ versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we come to the last chapter of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not a long chapter indeed it is rather short but its entire record is full of the contrast between Christ and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From the beginning to the end we may see the difference and the distance between Christ and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse one we read, "In the end of the sabbath..."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>King James Version .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sabbath, we know, was the symbol of the old Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, when we read "In the end of the sabbath," it means at the end of the old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The resurrection of Christ is the end of the old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A new age has dawned, the age of the resurrected Christ, not the old age of the old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We read further, "As it began to dawn toward the first day of the week..."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Something was dawning it was the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Something ended and something began.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE AGE OF WOMEN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now notice that it was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary who came to see the sepulchre.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is much significance, we know, in whatever the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must realize that in the Old Testament every great event was always revealed to men, not to women.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is rather difficult to find one case in the Old Testament where God revealed anything firstly to a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament women were not reckoned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But here we read that the new start of the new age was discovered not by men, but by women.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And all the women here were of the same name Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There were no males just females.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was against the old way, against the religious regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The old way was always with the men, but the new way is always with the women.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that the brothers will say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me check with you all, especially the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Are you male or female?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today in the new age we must answer, spiritually speaking, that we are all females, we are all Marys.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the vision; this is the new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a small thing to discover the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be clear that the resurrection had occurred already, but before the women went there it was not discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the end of chapter 27 we read that the chief priests and Pharisees sealed the grave with a stone and set a watch.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But they never witnessed the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The stone was still there, but Jesus was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Apparently nothing had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nobody knew that Jesus was resurrected, but by the coming of these Marys it was discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We read that there was a great earthquake and an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and rolled away the stone v. 2 . Why did he roll away the stone? To let Jesus out? No! It was to show the sisters that the tomb was empty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord's way today is not according to the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The age has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His resurrection was not discovered by men, but by women.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Spiritually speaking, this is not the age of men, but the age of women.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to religion everything must be revealed to men; but here is something discovered by women.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is entirely contrary to religion.</S>
