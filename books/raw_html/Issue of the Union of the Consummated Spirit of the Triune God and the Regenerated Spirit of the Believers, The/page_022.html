<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br>IS THE CONSTITUTION, IN THE AFOREMENTIONED<br>TWO SPIRITS, OF THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD WITH A GROUP OF TRIPARTITE MEN WHOM HE HAS REDEEMED, REGENERATED, SANCTIFIED, RENEWED, TRANSFORMED,<br>AND CONFORMED TO HIS IMAGE</H2><P>In the first eight chapters of Romans, Paul told us that once a person believes in the Lord, he is justified by God (Rom. 3:24); after he is justified, he is sanctified (6:19, 22); and after he is sanctified, he lives in Christ (8:1). In chapter twelve Paul said that all those who live in Christ are members of Christ. All the members combined are the Body of Christ (vv. 4-5). This Body of Christ is God's ultimate desire. The building up of the Body of Christ is a constitution, in the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man, of the processed and consummated Triune God with the tripartite men whom He has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to His image.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being Constituted with the Believers<br>Who Are Redeemed, Regenerated, Sanctified, Renewed, and Transformed by God<br>as Its Outward Framework</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the constitution of the processed Triune God with the transformed human beings. It is constituted by the union of God and man. The Triune God has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The Body of Christ is the constitution of such a processed God with His redeemed people. This constitution has the believers who are redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed by God as its outward framework. In other words, the constitution of such a building of God and man has man as its outward framework. However, it is not ordinary men who are the framework, but the believers whom God has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Also Having the Processed and Consummated Triune God as Its Inward Element</H2><P>The constitution of the Body of Christ has not only the believers whom God has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed, as its outward framework, but has also the processed and consummated Triune God as its inward element. Our human body has an outward framework and an inward element. The outward framework plus the inward element are a living and organic body. It is the same with the Body of Christ. The redeemed people are the outward framework; the redeeming God is the inward element.</P><P>The Father of the Triune God is the source of the inward element of the constitution of the Body of Christ. The Son of the Triune God is the inward element itself. The Spirit of the Triune God is the essence of the inward element. From Ephesians 4:4-6 we can see the source, element, and essence of the Body of Christ. Verse 4 speaks of one Body and one Spirit, verse 5, of one Lord, and verse 6, of one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. The one Body is the framework; the inward element is the Father as the source, the Son as the element from the Father, and the Spirit as the essence of the element. The Body of Christ is constituted with the Triune God and His redeemed people, with His redeemed people as the outward framework and the Triune God Himself as the inward element.</P><P>Most Christians today do not speak concerning the Body of Christ. Even if they do, they do not speak of it very clearly. Even among us, our way of presentation in the past has not been very clear. We commonly say that the Body of Christ is universal, whereas the church is local. However, the Body of Christ is not a matter of being universal or local, but a matter of the outward framework and the inward element. If there were only the outward framework without the inward element, the Body would be a dead corpse. With the outward framework, there must also be the inward element; then it is a living and organic Body. Today God has made those whom He redeemed, regenerated, and transformed to be the outward framework. God Himself, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is the inward element. The Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. These four&#151;the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and man&#151;blended and built together become the Body of Christ.</P>
