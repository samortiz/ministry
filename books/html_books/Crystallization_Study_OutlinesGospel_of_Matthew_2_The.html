<h1 class="title">The Aspects of the Kingdom of the Heavens,<br />
a Picture of the Millennium,<br />
and a Miniature of the Manifestation of the Kingdom</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:3, 20; 13:31-32; 16:28&mdash;17:5; 13:43</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>If we would know the truth of the kingdom in a thorough way, we need a full understanding of the three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation&mdash; Matt. 5:3; 13:31-32, 43:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature&mdash;chs. 5&mdash;7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is an exercise to the seeking believers&mdash;5:3, 20; 7:13-14, 21.</li>
		<li>Only the overcomers are in the reality of the kingdom&mdash;Rev. 2:7.</li>
		<li>Those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will be manifested with Christ to be kings in the millennium&mdash;20:4, 6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward condition of the kingdom of the heavens in name&mdash;Matt. 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is today&rsquo;s Christendom, which includes all the false Christians&mdash;vv. 27, 38-39a.</li>
		<li>That which constitutes the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens will be thrown into the lake of fire&mdash;vv. 30, 40-42a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power&mdash;chs. 24&mdash;25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be the manifestation of the reality of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;5:3; 13:43:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the next age the reality of the kingdom will become the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;7:21.</li>
			<li>At His coming back, the Lord will deal first with the appearance of the kingdom, and then He will transfer the reality of the kingdom into the next age to become the manifestation of the kingdom&mdash;13:41-43.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, composed of the overcoming saints, will actually be the New Jerusalem during the millennium&mdash;Rev. 2:7; 3:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Genesis 47 we have a picture of the millennium:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Under Joseph, Egypt prefigured the millennium with all the people on the same level; no longer were there distinctions between high and low and between rich and poor:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The whole land of Egypt became a land of enjoyment.</li>
		<li>All the people became enjoyers on the same level because everyone and everything was under Joseph; this is a picture of the millennium, where everything will be under the Lord&rsquo;s hand&mdash;vv. 14-21; Psa. 24:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ is typified by Joseph, and the kingdom is foreshadowed by the house of Israel&mdash;Gen. 45:8; 47:11, 27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Joseph&rsquo;s life under the heavenly vision was the life of the kingdom of the heavens described in Matthew 5&mdash;7.</li>
		<li>We, the kingdom people, are being trained to be Josephs, to be kings, to manifest the reigning aspect of the mature life&mdash;2 Pet. 1:5-11.</li>
		<li>Joseph&rsquo;s self-denial, his restriction under God&rsquo;s sovereign hand, was the key to the practice of the kingdom life&mdash;Gen. 45:4-8; 50:15-21.</li>
		<li>Because Joseph denied himself and lived under God&rsquo;s restriction, the kingdom could be brought in through him&mdash;Matt. 16:24-28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What is described in Matthew 16:28&mdash;17:5 is a miniature of the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The center of this miniature is the glorified Jesus, and with Him are Moses and Elijah, representing the Old Testament overcomers, and Peter, James, and John, representing the New Testament overcomers&mdash; 17:1-3.</li>
	<li>On the mountain with the Lord Jesus, Peter, James, and John had a foretaste of the coming manifestation of the kingdom&mdash;16:28&mdash;17:3.</li>
	<li>For the Lord Jesus to be transfigured meant that His humanity was saturated and permeated with His divinity; this transfiguration, which was His glorification, was equal to His coming in His kingdom&mdash; v. 2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The transfiguration, the shining, of the Lord Jesus was His coming in His kingdom; where His transfiguration is, there is the coming of the kingdom&mdash; Mark 9:1-4; Luke 9:27-31.</li>
		<li>The transfiguration of the Lord Jesus was the realization of what He is.</li>
		<li>The kingdom is the shining of the reality of the Lord Jesus; to be under His shining is to be in the kingdom&mdash;Rev. 22:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 13:43a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>At the time of the manifestation of the kingdom, our humanity will be glorified by the glorious divinity within us&mdash;Col. 1:27.</li>
		<li>Christ has been sown into our heart as a seed; this seed will grow and develop until it is manifested in glory&mdash;Mark 4:26-29; Col. 3:3-4.</li>
		<li>In one sense, the Lord will come back from heaven, but in another sense, He will come out of us; when He fully lives Himself out of us, that will be the time of His coming&mdash;Matt. 16:27a; 2 Thes. 1:10; Col. 1:27; 3:4.</li>
		<li>At the time of the full manifestation of the kingdom, we will fully enter into glory&mdash;Rom. 8:18, 21; Heb. 2:10; Phil. 3:21.</li>
		<li>In the millennium the overcoming believers will be with Christ in the bright glory of the kingdom, whereas the defeated Christians will suffer discipline in the outer darkness&mdash;Matt. 13:43a; 8:12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The outer darkness is the darkness outside the bright glory in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;22:13.</li>
			<li>To be cast out into outer darkness is to be dealt with dispensationally, to be disqualified from participating in the enjoyment of the kingdom during the millennium, for not having lived by Christ an overcoming life.</li>
			</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">The Appearance of the Kingdom of the Heavens&mdash;<br />
the Tares and the Great Tree</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 13:24-30, 36-43, 31-32;<br />
Rev. 18:2; 21:9-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord&rsquo;s teaching in chapters five through seven, His parables in chapter thirteen, and His prophecy in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five, when added together, unveil the entire situation of the kingdom of the heavens.</li>
<li>The parable of the tares reveals the establishment of the kingdom and its false constituents&mdash;13:24-30, 36-43:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, the field is the world, the good seed are the sons of the kingdom, and the tares, the false believers, are the sons of the evil one&mdash;vv. 37-38.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of the heavens was established with the sons of the kingdom, the wheat, but the sons of the evil one, the tares, grew up to alter the situation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A difference has arisen between the kingdom of the heavens and its outward appearance&mdash;5:3; 13:24.</li>
		<li>The sons of the kingdom constitute the kingdom, and the sons of the evil one have formed the outward appearance of the kingdom, today&rsquo;s Christendom&mdash;v. 38.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Throughout the New Testament we see the growth and development of the tares&mdash;Acts 20:29-30; Rom. 16:17-18; 2 Cor. 11:13-15; Gal. 2:4-5; Phil. 3:2; 1 Tim. 1:19-20; 2 Tim. 4:14-15; Heb. 12:15; 2 Pet. 2:1-3; 1 John 2:18-19; 2 John 7; Jude 4, 8-16; Rev. 2:2b.</li>
	<li>In the eyes of God, the tares are exceedingly evil; the judgment upon the tares will be very serious because they have been confusing, frustrating, and damaging God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Matt. 13:30, 40-42.</li>
	<li>Satan sowed tares among the wheat to frustrate the life of the wheat from growing&mdash;vv. 25-30:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The tares were sown by the enemy to frustrate the proper growth of the divine life in the believers (the wheat).</li>
		<li>Although the growth of life of the wheat has been greatly frustrated by the tares, the wheat still grows with the divine life and produces the grain which is ground into fine flour to make a loaf for an offering to God for His enjoyment and satisfaction&mdash;v. 33; 1 Cor. 10:16-17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Matthew 13:31-32 we have a parable telling of the abnormal development of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Satan is very subtle in changing the principle of life to make the mustard seed grow not according to its kind&mdash;v. 32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>According to the law of God&rsquo;s creation, every plant must be according to its kind&mdash;Gen. 1:11-12.</li>
		<li>The mustard seed should become an herb to produce proper food for people, but Satan made it a tree to become a lodging place for so many birds (evil persons, spirits, and things)&mdash;Matt. 13:32.</li>
		<li>Because the nature of the mustard seed was changed, it is no longer an herb to feed people but a tree to lodge birds; this great tree is today&rsquo;s Christendom&mdash;cf. Dan. 4:4-26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The parable of the mustard seed corresponds to the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3&mdash;the church in Pergamos, which signifies the church in union with the world and becoming monstrously great&mdash;2:12-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard herb, sojourning on the earth; however, with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled in the earth as a tree, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches to lodge many evil persons and things&mdash;Matt. 13:31-32.</li>
		<li>Today&rsquo;s Christendom is a great tree with many sinful persons and evil spirits lodging in its branches.</li>
		<li>To have the element of the great tree is to desire to be great and have a nice fa&#231;ade.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The great tree in Matthew 13 will be fully developed into Babylon the Great, which is full of leaven, pollution, corruption, and all kinds of evil things&mdash;Rev. 18:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens will consummate with a city&mdash;the New Jerusalem; the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens will also consummate with a city&mdash;Babylon the Great&mdash; 21:9-11.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s building, is holy, and Babylon the Great, Satan&rsquo;s building, is great; God does not want something great&mdash;He wants something holy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The picture of Christendom in Matthew 13, given in a prophetic way, unveils the real situation of today&rsquo;s deformed and degraded Christianity:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As a religious system, Christianity is deformed from the form of the revelation in the holy Word and is also degraded&mdash;Eph. 3:3-11; 2 Tim. 2:19-21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The deformed and degraded Christianity has left the God-ordained way for carrying out the New Testament economy&mdash;Rev. 2:14-15; 3:1-2.</li>
		<li>This degraded religious system takes the natural, human, traditional, cultural, and religious way.</li>
		<li>The religious system of today&rsquo;s Christendom kills the living members of the Body of Christ and annuls the organic function of the members of Christ.</li>
		<li>The deformed and degraded Christianity forfeits the proper church life, not caring for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2; 12:27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We should stay away from the practice of deformed and degraded Christianity and come back to the divine revelation for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery&mdash;Matt. 16:18.</li>
	<li>We need to come back to the God-ordained way to practice the New Testament economy so that God can operate in His Divine Trinity to dispense His triune being into us that we may be filled and saturated with the Divine Being to become His corporate expression&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 3:16-17a; 4:4-6, 11-16.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Enemy Satan&rsquo;s Leavening of the Church</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 13:33; 16:6, 11-12; Mark 8:15;<br />
Luke 12:1b; Rev. 2:20, 24; 17:4-6; 1 Cor. 5:7-8</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>&ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 13:33:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content, must be a loaf of unleavened bread&mdash;1 Cor. 5:7-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>However, the woman, signifying the Catholic Church, added leaven (signifying evil, heretical, and pagan things) into the fine flour (signifying Christ as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man)&mdash;cf. Lev. 2:4-5, 11.</li>
		<li>This woman is the great harlot of Revelation 17, who mixes abominations with the divine things; Jezebel, the pagan wife of Ahab, is a type of this apostate church&mdash;vv. 4-6; 1 Kings 16:31; 19:1-2; 21:23, 25-26; 2 Kings 9:7.</li>
		<li>The Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ; the Lord wants to recover all the leavened truths&mdash;cf. Gen. 18:6; Matt. 15:3; John 18:37-38.</li>
		<li>Such leavening is absolutely against the Scriptures, which strongly forbid putting any leaven into the meal offering&mdash;Lev. 2:4-5, 11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy&rdquo;&mdash;Luke 12:1b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The teaching of the Pharisees was hypocritical&mdash; Matt. 23:13-15, 23, 25-32; cf. Rev. 17:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The apostate church is not built in a solid way with gold, pearls, and precious stones; she is only gilded with these treasures as ornaments for outward display and a false appearance&mdash;Rev. 17:4.</li>
			<li>The significance of Achan&rsquo;s sin was his coveting a beautiful Babylonian garment in his seeking to improve himself, to make himself look better, for the sake of appearance&mdash;Josh. 7:21.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Pharisees were filled with the leaven of ambition and pride&mdash;Matt. 23:6-7; cf. 20:20-28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees&rdquo; (Matt. 16:6); &ldquo;then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees&rdquo; (v. 12):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The teaching of the Sadducees denied the resurrection, angels, and spirits (Acts 23:8), like today&rsquo;s modernism.</li>
		<li>Hence, both the teaching of the Pharisees and the teaching of the Sadducees were impure and evil and were likened to leaven, which was not to be seen among God&rsquo;s people&mdash;Exo. 13:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Beware of...the leaven of Herod&rdquo;&mdash;Mark 8:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The leaven of Herod was his corruption and injustice in politics&mdash;cf. Rev. 17:1-2.</li>
		<li>Herod&rsquo;s slaying of John the Baptist indicates Satan&rsquo;s hatred, expressed by the darkness and injustice of the worldly power, toward the faithful forerunner of the Slave-Savior&mdash;Mark 6:26-27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The enemy Satan has corrupted the church by leavening the church:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Satan leavened the initial church, typified by the two wave-loaves offered to God on the day of Pentecost (Lev. 23:15-17), as confirmed by the cases in Acts 5:1-11 and 6:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Ananias and Sapphira, in hypocrisy, lied to the Holy Spirit&mdash;Acts 5:1-11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>They were not willing to offer everything cheerfully to God, but before man they acted as if they had offered all; they were just pretending.</li>
			<li>Everything done in falsehood to receive glory from man is done in the principle of the harlot, not in the principle of the bride&mdash;John 5:44; 12:42-43.</li>
			<li>It is a great matter for God&rsquo;s children to be delivered from pretending before man in order to receive glory from man&mdash;Matt. 6:1-6; 15:7-8.</li>
			<li>False consecration is sin, and false spirituality is also sin; true worship is in spirit and in truthfulness&mdash;John 4:24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Acts 6:1 shows that at the beginning of the church life, trouble was caused by language differences&mdash; cf. Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Satan leavened the church in Corinth with the gross sin of fornication&mdash;1 Cor. 5:1-8.</li>
	<li>Satan leavened the church with different teachings, that is, with teachings other than the economy of God&mdash;1 Tim. 1:3-4.</li>
	<li>Satan leavened the early church with Judaism, Gnosticism, and asceticism&mdash;Col. 2:16; Acts 15:1-2; Gal. 6:15; Acts 11:2-3; Gal. 2:12-13; 1:14; Col. 2:8, 20-23.</li>
	<li>Satan leavened the church with Catholicism in the papal system, hierarchy, heresies, idolatry, and pagan practices&mdash;Rev. 2:18-29.</li>
	<li>Satan leavened the church with Protestantism in hierarchy, being living in name but dead in actuality, different teachings, traditions, modernism, worldliness, and divisions&mdash;3:1-6.</li>
	<li>Satan leavened the church with nationalism, racialism, socialism, liberalism, and politics&mdash;cf. Col. 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>Satan leavened the church with the believers&rsquo; natural man, flesh and its lust, sin in their nature and sins in their deeds, and all the evil things listed in Galatians 5:19-21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to enjoy Christ as our unleavened banquet, the reality of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for the entire period of our Christian life&mdash;1 Cor. 5:7-8; Exo. 12:15-20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This is a long feast, which we must keep not with the sin of our old nature, the old leaven, but with unleavened bread, which is the Christ of our new nature as our nourishment and enjoyment.</li>
	<li>If we live with Christ as our Substitute, have a new beginning of life, and deal with all exposed sin, the leaven in our lives, we will have a daily living that is worthy of being a memorial&mdash;Exo. 13:4-9.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Treasure and the Pearl</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 13:44-46</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The basic thought in Matthew 13 and 1 Corinthians 3 is the basic thought of the entire Bible&mdash; life and building:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In both chapters we have God&rsquo;s farm and God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Matt. 13:3, 24, 37-38a, 44-46; 1 Cor. 3:9b-12.</li>
	<li>The parables in Matthew 13 reveal the matters of life and building:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first four parables are related to God&rsquo;s farm for growing Christ into the kingdom&mdash;vv. 1-33.</li>
		<li>The fifth and sixth parables are related to transformation for producing precious material for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;vv. 44-46.</li>
		<li>In today&rsquo;s Christendom the Lord can find a great deal of wheat and a small amount of meal, but He cannot find much of the pearl and the treasure.</li>
		<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery it is not adequate simply to be wheat or meal; we must also be the pearl and the precious stones.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jesus is continually seeking two things&mdash; the kingdom as the treasure and the church as the pearl&mdash;vv. 44-46:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we would apply the parables of the treasure and the pearl in a practical way, we need to see that during the period of the existence of Christendom, the Lord is working to gain the treasure and the pearl.</li>
	<li>In order to understand the treasure and the pearl in 13:44-46, we need to consider the kingdom and the church in 16:18-19; the treasure is the kingdom, and the pearl is the church.</li>
	<li>On the cross the Lord Jesus sacrificed everything to buy both the pearl and the field in which the treasure was hidden; this reveals how much He desires the kingdom and the church&mdash;13:44-46.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The treasure hidden in the field signifies the kingdom hidden in the God-created earth&mdash;v. 44:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The treasure signifies the kingdom with the true Israel, God&rsquo;s peculiar treasure&mdash;Exo. 19:5; Psa. 135:4.</li>
	<li>The treasure hidden in the field must consist of gold or precious stones, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12; Rev. 21:18-20.</li>
	<li>Christ went to the cross and sacrificed all that He had to redeem the God-created earth because within the earth there was the kingdom, the treasure&mdash;Matt. 13:44:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Bible the earth signifies the world created by God, and the sea signifies the world corrupted by Satan&mdash;Gen. 1:26-28; Isa 57:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God&rsquo;s kingdom cannot be established in the sea, and God&rsquo;s will cannot be done in the Satan-corrupted world.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s will must be done on the God-created earth, and God&rsquo;s kingdom must be established on the Christ-redeemed earth&mdash;Matt. 6:10.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In order to have the kingdom on earth, the Lord had to redeem the earth because it had been polluted by Satan&rsquo;s fall and man&rsquo;s sin.</li>
		<li>The kingdom is realized in the church life, but its manifestation is related to the redeemed nation of Israel&mdash;Rom. 14:17; Acts 1:3, 6; 3:21; Matt. 19:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Because the pearl comes out of the sea, which signifies the world corrupted by Satan (Rev. 17:15), it must refer to the church, which is constituted mainly of regenerated believers from the Gentile world and which is of great value&mdash;Matt. 13:45-46:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The merchant in verse 45 is Christ, who was seeking the church for His kingdom; after finding it in 16:18 and 18:17, He went to the cross and sold all that He had and bought it for the kingdom&mdash;Acts 20:28.</li>
	<li>Ephesians 5:27 says that Christ will present to Himself a glorious church without spot, wrinkle, or any such thing; this is the church as the beautiful pearl produced out of the Gentile world.</li>
	<li>The parable of the pearl in Matthew 13:45-46 reveals that the Lord&rsquo;s desire is to have this pearl of great value&mdash;the church as the consummation of His complete salvation&mdash;Rom. 5:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The desire of Christ in accomplishing His judicial redemption and carrying out His organic salvation is that He would gain not merely individuals but the church, which is His Body&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 5:23.</li>
		<li>The Lord desires to gain this pearl of great value by His ministry in three stages&mdash;incarnation, inclusion, and intensification:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>First, Christ worked to gain His desire by the judicial redemption accomplished by Him in His incarnation&mdash;John 1:14, 29.</li>
			<li>Christ carries out His organic salvation by Himself as the life-giving Spirit in His stage of inclusion&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
			<li>The intensified work of Christ&rsquo;s organic salvation is carried out by Him as the sevenfold intensified Spirit in His stage of intensification&mdash;Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The parables in Matthew 13 reveal that the Lord Jesus came as the Sower to sow the seed and that eventually He gained the pearl:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The seed is Christ, and the pearl is the church; the pearl comes out of the seed.</li>
		<li>The Sower Himself is the seed, and the multiplication of the seed is the multiplication of the Sower; hence, the kingdom is the multiplication of Christ as the seed sown into us.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The parables of the treasure and the pearl refer to the overcomers throughout the centuries&mdash;Rev. 2:7b, 11b, 17b, 26; 3:5, 12, 21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the first four parables the Lord covers Christendom in a general way, and in the next two parables He covers the overcomers in a particular way.</li>
	<li>In the eyes of God, the overcomers are more solid, precious, and valuable than the wheat; He likens them to the treasure hidden in the field and to the pearl out of the sea.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Prophecy of the Kingdom<br />
concerning Israel</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:1-31</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>In order for us to receive the revelation of the prophecy of the kingdom, our heart has to be fully on God and His desire, and we need to climb the high mountain to enter into His presence&mdash;cf. Dan. 9:1-23; Rev. 1:9-10; Matt. 24:3a.</li>
<li>We need to give heed to the prophetic word as to a lamp shining in a dark place&mdash;2 Pet. 1:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The prophetic word of the Scripture, as the shining lamp to us, conveys spiritual light to shine in our darkness (not merely knowledge in letters for mental apprehension), guiding us to enter into a bright day, even to pass through the dark night until the day of the Lord&rsquo;s appearing dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts&mdash;Rev. 22:16; 2:28; 2 Tim. 4:8.</li>
	<li>This will cause and encourage us to earnestly seek the Lord&rsquo;s presence and be watchful so that we will not miss the Lord in the secret part of His coming (parousia) when He will come as a thief&mdash;Matt. 24:27, 43; 2 Thes. 2:8.</li>
	<li>We must receive the warning of the prophetic word:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord warns us to watch&mdash;Matt. 24:42; cf. Col. 4:2.</li>
		<li>We need to take heed to ourselves that our hearts may not be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day come upon us suddenly as a snare&mdash;Luke 21:34.</li>
		<li>We need to be watchful at every time, beseeching that we would prevail to escape all the things which are about to happen and stand before Christ&mdash;v. 36.</li>
		<li>We need to keep the word of Christ&rsquo;s endurance&mdash; Rev. 3:10; cf. Rom. 15:4; Rev. 1:9.</li>
		<li>We need to overcome and keep the Lord&rsquo;s works&mdash; Rev. 2:26, 28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The prophecy of the kingdom given on the Mount of Olives is a continuation of the Lord&rsquo;s declaration regarding His forsaking of Israel&mdash;Matt. 23:37-39:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Matthew 24:1-14 reveals the history of Israel from Christ&rsquo;s ascension to the consummation of the age:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord revealed that the temple was about to be destroyed&mdash;vv. 1-2; cf. Ezek. 10:18; Matt. 22:7.</li>
		<li>Many deceivers will come in the name of Christ and claim to be Christ, leading many astray&mdash;24:4-5.</li>
		<li>There will be wars, rumors of wars, famines, and earthquakes&mdash;vv. 6-7; cf. Rev. 6:1-8.</li>
		<li>All these things are the beginning of birth pangs&mdash; Matt. 24:8:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The birth pangs, which refer to all the tribulations in the New Testament age, are suffered by the New Testament believers for the Lord&rsquo;s sake.</li>
			<li>These tribulations, along with the preaching of the gospel (v. 14), are used by God to produce His many sons so that He can constitute the church in this age, accomplish the kingdom in the coming age, and produce the New Jerusalem in eternity as the ultimate consummation of the church and the kingdom that He may have an eternal expression in eternity future&mdash; cf. Gal. 4:19; Rev. 12:2, 5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Jewish disciples, who were the prophets and wise men sent to the Jews (Matt. 23:34), will be persecuted and hated by all the nations&mdash;24:9.</li>
		<li>Many will be stumbled, delivering up one another and hating one another&mdash;v. 10.</li>
		<li>Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray&mdash;v. 11.</li>
		<li>Lawlessness will be multiplied, and the love of the many will grow cold&mdash;v. 12.</li>
		<li>The ones enduring to the end will be saved&mdash;v. 13.</li>
		<li>The gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Matthew 24:15-31 reveals the things that will happen at the consummation of the age:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The great tribulation will transpire in the last three and a half years of this age&mdash;cf. Dan. 9:27; 7:25; 12:7; Rev. 12:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Antichrist&rsquo;s image, the abomination of desolation, will be set up as an idol in the temple of God at the beginning of the great tribulation&mdash; Matt. 24:15, 21; Rev. 13:14-15; 2 Thes. 2:4.</li>
			<li>When the abomination of desolation is set up in the holy place, the Jews will need to flee&mdash;Matt. 24:16-20.</li>
			<li>No other tribulation will be able to compare with the great tribulation which will take place under the hand of Antichrist&mdash;vv. 21-22.</li>
			<li>False Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray the chosen&mdash;vv. 23-26.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The great tribulation will end with the open aspect of Christ&rsquo;s coming:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Twelve hundred sixty days after Antichrist sets up his image in the temple of God, Christ will come openly to the earth as a flash of lightning&mdash;v. 27; cf. Rev. 12:6; 13:5.</li>
			<li>Christ and His overcomers will come as a swift-flying army, like vultures devouring a corpse, to war against Antichrist and his armies and destroy them, thus executing God&rsquo;s judgment on them at Armageddon&mdash;Matt. 24:28; Rev. 19:17-21.</li>
			<li>Immediately after the tribulation, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken&mdash;Matt. 24:29.</li>
			<li>The sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and the tribes of Israel will repent and mourn at the Lord&rsquo;s appearing&mdash;v. 30; Zech. 12:10-14; Rev. 1:7.</li>
			<li>After the great tribulation, at His coming back to the earth, the Lord will gather together to the Holy Land the scattered Jews from all parts of the earth&mdash;Matt. 24:31; cf. Deut. 30:3-6.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>&ldquo;But learn the parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 24:32:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fig tree signifies the nation of Israel as a sign to us concerning the Lord&rsquo;s coming&mdash;Jer. 24:2, 5, 8.</li>
	<li>When the branch of the fig tree becomes tender and it puts forth its leaves, we know that summer, the full restoration of the Messianic kingdom, is near.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;For just as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 24:37:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Greek word for <em>coming</em> (parousia) means &ldquo;presence&rdquo;&mdash;v. 3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In ancient times this word was applied to the coming of a dignified person; in the New Testament this word refers to the coming of Christ, the most dignified One.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s coming will be His presence with His people; His parousia will begin with the rapture of the man-child (Rev. 12:5) and of the firstfruits (14:1-4) and will end with His appearing on the earth with the saints&mdash;Matt. 24:27; 2 Thes. 2:8; Jude 14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The situation before the Lord&rsquo;s coming will be like that in the days of Noah:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Noah lived in a crooked and perverse age&mdash;Gen. 6:1-22:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As a result of man&rsquo;s first fall, the evil nature of Satan had been injected into man&mdash;3:1-6; John 8:44.</li>
			<li>In the second fall, the evil nature of Satan in man devised and developed a godless human culture&mdash;Gen. 4:16-24; 1 John 5:19b.</li>
			<li>At the time of the third fall, this godless culture produced an evil, crooked, corrupted, and perverse generation, and the evil power of darkness corrupted the earth and filled it with violence&mdash; Gen. 6:1-13.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In Matthew 24:37-39 and Luke 17:26-27 the Lord Jesus likened our age to the days of Noah:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The conditions of evil living that stupefied the generation of Noah before the flood portray the perilous condition of man&rsquo;s living before the great tribulation and the Lord&rsquo;s parousia&mdash; Matt. 24:21, 3, 27, 37, 39.</li>
			<li>If we would participate in the overcomers&rsquo; rapture to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s parousia and escape the great tribulation, we must overcome the stupefying effect of man&rsquo;s living today&mdash;Luke 21:34-36.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;At that time two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 24:40-41:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The two men and the two women represent the living believers at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</li>
	<li>To be taken is to be raptured before the great tribulation&mdash;v. 21; Rev. 3:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The rapture is the consummating step of God&rsquo;s full salvation in life&mdash;the transfiguration, the redemption, of our body&mdash;Rom. 5:10; 8:23; Phil. 3:21.</li>
		<li>After we have believed in the Lord and are saved, because of the demand of the divine life which we have received and because of the intensity of our love toward the Lord, we desire to pursue a life that awaits the Lord&rsquo;s coming&mdash;1 Thes. 1:10; 2:19; 3:13; 4:15; 5:23.</li>
		<li>In such a life of loving the Lord and waiting for His coming, we expect, according to that which is revealed and prophesied in the Bible, to be raptured to the presence of the Lord, to meet together joyfully with Him&mdash;Matt. 24:40-41; Luke 17:31-36; 21:36.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Matthew 24:40-41 refers to the secret rapture, the rapture of the ready ones, the mature ones:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The difference between the one who is taken and the one who is left is in the maturity of life; one is mature in life, and the other is not&mdash;Heb. 6:1.</li>
		<li>To become matured is not an overnight matter; for the Lord&rsquo;s coming we need to prepare ourselves, love Him, and grow in Him, that at His appearing we may be mature to be raptured.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24:40-41 shows us that as we wait for His coming and expect to be raptured, we must be faithful in our daily duties, living a properly balanced human life&mdash;cf. 2 Thes. 3:6-15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 24:42:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The overcomers will be the watchful saints, who will be raptured before the coming of the great tribulation&mdash; v. 21.</li>
	<li>Whether or not we will be raptured before the great tribulation and taken away to meet Christ on the throne depends on our watchfulness and on our beseeching in a particular way&mdash;Luke 21:36.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;But know this, that if the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 24:43:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Householder</em> refers to the believer, and <em>house</em> to the conduct and work that a believer has built up in his Christian life.</li>
	<li>A thief comes only to steal what is precious; we need to be precious by being mature so that the Lord will come secretly and take us away as His treasure&mdash;Rev. 3:3; 16:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 24:44:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the light of the truth concerning the rapture, we need to make ourselves ready for the Lord&rsquo;s coming by praying that we may grow and mature in life.</li>
	<li>The rapture in which we will participate is Christ Himself&mdash;Col. 1:27; 3:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The rapture is a matter of being filled with Christ; thus, in order to be raptured, we need to be filled with Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:17a, 19b.</li>
		<li>When we have Christ wrought into us to a sufficient degree, we will be raptured&mdash;Gal. 4:19; 2 Thes. 1:10.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Faithful and Prudent Slave</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:45-51</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>&ldquo;Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time? Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 24:45-47:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy in faith is His household economy, His household administration, which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church, the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; 3:15; Eph. 2:19.</li>
	<li>The faithful and prudent slave is a steward in God&rsquo;s house, a household administrator, dispensing Christ as food to His believers&mdash;1 Cor. 9:17; Eph. 3:2; 1 Cor. 4:1; 1 Pet. 4:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Faithfulness is shown toward the Lord (1 Cor. 4:2; 7:25), whereas prudence is exercised toward the believers (cf. Col. 1:28; 2 Chron. 1:10; Phil. 4:5).</li>
		<li>In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord will set the faithful slave over all His possessions; this will be a reward to His slave&mdash; Matt. 25:21, 23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li><em>Give them food</em> refers to ministering the word of God and Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church; Christ as the life-giving Spirit is our food, embodied and realized in the word of life&mdash;John 6:57, 63, 68:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In order to enjoy the Lord as our spiritual food so that we can feed others, we need to receive His word by means of all prayer and with much reconsideration&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18; cf. Lev. 11:2-3; Ezek. 3:1-4.</li>
		<li>We need to continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&mdash;Acts 6:4; cf. Heb. 7:25; 8:2.</li>
		<li>We need to prophesy to build up the church&mdash; speaking what we see with living words of this life under the instant and fresh inspiration, anointing, and enlightenment of the Holy Spirit through the exercise of our spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 14:4b; Acts 5:20; 4:20; 22:15.</li>
		<li>We need to pray ourselves into God to receive the life-giving Spirit as our supply, our spiritual food, to feed ourselves and those under our care&mdash;Luke 11:1-13.</li>
		<li>We need to be a life-giving &ldquo;asker,&rdquo; a channel of the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 John 5:16.</li>
		<li>We need to be &ldquo;sons of fresh oil&rdquo; as a channel of supply to the churches&mdash;Zech. 4:6, 12-14; Judg. 9:9; Phil. 1:23-25; Rev. 3:18; Matt. 25:9.</li>
		<li>We need to be one with the Lord to cherish others in His humanity and nourish others in His divinity&mdash; Rev. 1:13; Eph. 5:29.</li>
		<li>We need to feed the Lord&rsquo;s lambs and sheep in cooperation with Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry&mdash;John 21:15-17; 1 Pet. 2:25; 5:1-4; Heb. 13:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;But if that evil slave says in his heart, My master delays, and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunken, the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, and will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 24:48-51:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To say in our heart that our Master delays is to love the present evil age and not to love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing&mdash;2 Tim. 4:8, 10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As long as we have today, we should love the Lord and His appearing, awaiting His coming and taking His coming as a warning, an encouragement, and an incentive&mdash;2 Tim. 4:8; Phil. 3:20; Rev. 22:12.</li>
		<li>We need to watch and be ready for His coming&mdash; Matt. 25:13; 24:44.</li>
		<li>We need to beware of covetousness, not storing up treasure for ourselves but being rich toward God&mdash; Luke 12:16-21; 2 Cor. 6:10; Eph. 3:8.</li>
		<li>We need to remember Lot&rsquo;s wife, not loving and treasuring the evil world which God is going to judge and utterly destroy&mdash;Luke 17:28-32.</li>
		<li>We need to be watchful and beseeching so that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming would not come upon us suddenly as a snare&mdash;21:34-36; cf. Matt. 2:3.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;&mdash;this should be the longing, cry, and constant prayer of those who love the Lord and His appearing&mdash;Rev. 22:20; Titus 2:12-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To beat our fellow slaves is to mistreat our fellow believers&mdash;cf. Acts 9:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should not judge and condemn our fellow believers but be kind to them, tenderhearted, forgiving them, even as God in Christ also forgave us&mdash;Luke 6:37; Eph. 4:31-32.</li>
		<li>We should not revile or criticize our brothers but consider them more excellent than ourselves&mdash; 1 Cor. 6:10; Phil. 2:3, 29.</li>
		<li>We should not lord it over our fellow believers but serve them as a servant, even as a slave, to feed them with the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Pet. 5:3; Matt. 20:25-28; cf. Num. 17:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To eat and drink with the drunken is to keep company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because of their divine nature and holy standing, the believers should not be yoked together with the unbelievers; this should be applied to all intimate relationships between believers and unbelievers, not only to marriage and business&mdash;2 Cor. 6:14; 1 Cor. 15:33; cf. Prov. 13:20.</li>
		<li>We need to flee youthful lusts and pursue the all-inclusive Christ with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart&mdash;2 Tim. 2:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The faithful and prudent slave will be rewarded with the authority to rule in the manifestation of the kingdom, whereas the evil slave will be cut off from the glorious Christ, from the glory of His kingdom, and from His glorious presence in His kingdom&mdash;Matt. 24:47, 51:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be cut off from the manifestation of the kingdom is to be cast into the outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The outer darkness is the darkness outside the bright glory in the manifestation of the kingdom&mdash;25:30; 16:28.</li>
			<li>Weeping indicates regret, and gnashing of teeth indicates self blame.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>To reign with Christ over the nations in the millennial kingdom will be a prize to His faithful and prudent slaves&mdash;Rev. 2:26; Luke 19:16-19.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>&ldquo;At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 25:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Virgins signify the believers in the aspect of life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Being a virgin is not a matter of work, service, or activity; it is a matter of life.</li>
		<li>Being a virgin is not a matter of what we do or are able to do; it is absolutely a matter of what we are.</li>
		<li>In the new creation God makes all the believers females, virgins loving the Lord Jesus&mdash;2 Cor. 11:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Anyone who considers himself a man and not a virgin will not be qualified to go to the air to meet the Lord&mdash;1 Thes. 4:17.</li>
			<li>If we would participate in the New Jerusalem, which is an aggregate virgin, we ourselves must be virgins who love the Lord and wait for Him&mdash;Rev. 21:2; S. S. 6:13; 1:3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Lamps signify the spirit of the believers, which contains the Spirit of God as the oil&mdash;Prov. 20:27; Rom. 8:16; Heb. 1:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The believers shine with the light of the Spirit of God from within their spirit.</li>
		<li>The believers become the light of the world, like a lamp shining in the darkness of this age, to bear the testimony of the Lord for the glory of God&mdash; Matt. 5:14-16; Phil. 2:15-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li><em>Went forth</em> indicates that the believers are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As virgins, we do not settle or linger in any place; instead, we are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ as our Bridegroom&mdash;Matt. 9:15.</li>
		<li>We are the virgins going, and Christ is the Bridegroom coming&mdash;John 3:29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;The prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 25:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Vessels signify the soul of the believers&mdash;Rom. 9:21, 23.</li>
	<li>Having oil in our lamps signifies having the Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit; taking oil in our vessels signifies having the fullness of the Spirit saturating our soul.</li>
	<li>All believers have their lamps burning, but many have no desire or intention of preparing oil in their vessels.</li>
	<li>If we are prudent virgins, we will have not only the ordinary portion of oil&mdash;the Spirit in our spirit&mdash;but also the extra portion of oil&mdash;the Spirit in our soul for our transformation&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	<li>To be transformed is to be saturated with the extra portion of the oil, to be filled with the Spirit in all our inward parts&mdash;Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 25:9b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To buy means to pay a price; we have to pay the price for the filling of the Spirit in our soul:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit who came into our spirit (Rom. 8:16) was given freely, but the saturating Spirit to fill our entire being, especially our soul, is not free; this is something that we have to pay a price for, that we have to buy.</li>
		<li>How much we will be transformed depends on how great a price we are willing to pay.</li>
		<li>The infilling of the Holy Spirit is obtained at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with the self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ&mdash;Matt. 16:24-26; Mark 12:30; Phil. 3:7-8.</li>
		<li>To have our soul, our being, saturated and filled with the Spirit cannot be accomplished in one day; it is a lifelong matter.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we are willing to pay the price, the Spirit will fill us and saturate us, and we will have the extra portion of oil prepared in our vessel, making us ready for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back&mdash;Matt. 24:44.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;As they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast. And the door was shut&rdquo;&mdash;25:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Those who were ready</em> must be those who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9), which is the wedding feast in Matthew 22:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should be ready by always having oil in our vessel, by always being filled with the Spirit of God in our whole being&mdash;24:44.</li>
		<li>The marriage feast will be held in the air (1 Thes. 4:17) during the Lord&rsquo;s coming; it will occur before the manifestation of the kingdom as a reward of mutual enjoyment with the Lord to the believers who are ready.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The foolish virgins, who do not take oil in their vessels and who are not ready when the Lord Jesus comes, will miss the wedding feast&mdash;Matt. 25:11-12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour&rdquo;&mdash;v. 13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be watchful is to be filled with the Holy Spirit; if we are not being filled all day long, we are not being watchful.</li>
	<li>In order to be watchful, we need the infilling of the Spirit, the spreading of the Spirit from our spirit to every part of our inward being&mdash;Eph. 5:18; 4:23.</li>

<li>If we would be prudent virgins, those who are watchful in life, we need to redeem the time&mdash;Eph. 5:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To redeem the time is to seize every available opportunity; this is to be wise in our walk&mdash;v. 15.</li>
	<li>To be filled in our regenerated spirit is to be filled with Christ unto all the fullness of God&mdash;v. 18; 3:19.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;If you are wise you will seek this fullness sooner, but if you are foolish you will put it off till later.... Seek above all things to have that extra supply of oil in the vessel....You cannot, by dodging the issue, avoid reaching maturity&mdash;or paying the price of it. But wisdom is connected with time.

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Lord likened Himself to a man going abroad (into the heavens) and delivering to his slaves his possessions&mdash;Matt. 25:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Slaves signify believers viewed from the aspect of service&mdash;1 Cor. 7:22-23; 2 Pet. 1:1; James 1:1; Rom. 1:1.</li>
	<li><em>His possessions</em> signifies the church (Eph. 1:18) with all the believers, who constitute God&rsquo;s household&mdash; Matt. 24:45.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To one of his slaves he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one&mdash;to each according to his own ability&mdash;25:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A talent, the largest unit of weight, was worth 6,000 denarii; the denarius was the chief silver coin of the Romans; it was considered good pay for a day&rsquo;s labor&mdash; cf. Matt. 20:2.</li>
	<li>Talents signify spiritual gifts (spiritual skills and abilities)&mdash;Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:4; 1 Pet. 4:10; 2 Tim. 1:6.</li>
	<li>All the members of the Body of Christ are gifted, and all are gifts&mdash;Rom. 12:6a; Eph. 4:7-8.</li>
	<li>The filling of the Spirit in life enables us to use the spiritual gift in service (work), and the spiritual gift in service matches the filling of the Spirit in life, that we may be a perfect member of Christ&mdash;cf. John 7:38; 1 Pet. 4:10.</li>
	<li><em>Own ability</em> signifies our natural ability, which is constituted of God&rsquo;s creation and our learning&mdash;cf. Acts 7:22.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The five-talented one traded with his talents to gain another five talents, and the two-talented one traded with his talents to gain another two talents&mdash; Matt. 25:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Trading with talents signifies using the gift the Lord has given us&mdash;cf. 1 Tim. 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6.</li>
	<li>Gaining other talents signifies that the gift we received from the Lord has been used to the fullest extent, without any loss or waste&mdash;cf. 2 Tim. 4:5b.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The one-talented one went off, dug in the earth, and hid his master&rsquo;s money&mdash;Matt. 25:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The main emphasis in this parable is on the one-talented one, who received the smallest gift; it is very easy for the least gifted ones to mistreat or ignore their gift.</li>
	<li>The earth signifies the world; thus, <em>dug in the earth</em> signifies becoming involved in the world to bury the gift we have received from the Lord.</li>
	<li><em>Hid his master&rsquo;s money</em> signifies rendering the Lord&rsquo;s gift useless, letting it lie waste under the cloak of certain earthly excuses; to make any excuse for not using the Lord&rsquo;s gift is to hide the gift.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When the master returned to settle accounts with his slaves, the five-talented one and the two-talented one both received a reward&mdash;vv. 19-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord will settle accounts with us at His judgment seat, where our living, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment&mdash;1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 3:13-15.</li>
	<li>Although the gift given to the two-talented one is smaller than that given to the five-talented one, the Lord&rsquo;s appraisal and reward to both are the same&mdash; &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 25:21, 23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>A few things</em> signifies the Lord&rsquo;s work in this age&mdash; cf. Mark 14:8; Rev. 3:8.</li>
		<li>To be set over many things signifies the ruling authority and the responsibilities in the coming kingdom&mdash;Rev. 2:26; Luke 19:17-19.</li>
		<li><em>The joy of your master</em> signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom&mdash;cf. Phil. 3:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The one-talented one was rebuked by his master and was punished&mdash;Matt. 25:24-30:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The one-talented one said that he was afraid and went off and hid his master&rsquo;s talent in the earth, telling his master that he kept his gift:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be afraid is negative; we should be positive and aggressive in using the Lord&rsquo;s gift&mdash;cf. 1 Thes. 2:2; Col. 1:29.</li>
		<li>To go away and hide the Lord&rsquo;s gift is to be too passive; we should be active in the Lord&rsquo;s work&mdash; 1 Cor. 15:58; 16:10.</li>
		<li>From generation to generation, all the difficulties lie with the one-talented ones, and as a result there is the weight of death in the church.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The master told the evil and slothful slave, &ldquo;You should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 25:26-27:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To deposit the master&rsquo;s money with the money changers, the bankers, signifies the use of the Lord&rsquo;s gift to save people and to minister His riches to them.</li>
		<li><em>Interest</em> signifies the profitable result we gain for the Lord&rsquo;s work by using His gift.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the coming kingdom the Lord&rsquo;s gift will be taken away from the slothful believers, and they will be cast into the outer darkness, but the faithful believers&rsquo; gift will be increased, and they will enter into the uttermost enjoyment of Christ&mdash;vv. 28-30.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;All the problems in the church today issue from the one-talented ones. The Lord has shown us that there is not one whose gift exceeds five talents. For a span of twenty years the church may have only one with five talents, but every day the church can have five persons, each with one talent. Any one of the children of God, even the one in the poorest condition, still has one talent; and when you put five of the one-talented ones together, it equals one who has five talents. If all the one-talented ones in the church today would bring forth their talents, there would be no need of so many great gifts among us. Just by the coming forth of the one-talented ones, let me tell you, the whole world will be conquered&rdquo;&mdash; W. Nee, <em>Further Talks on the Church Life,</em> p. 143.</li>

		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>For service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift, that we may be equipped as a good slave to accomplish what the Lord intends to accomplish&mdash; Matt. 25:20-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Our inward motive for serving the Lord is our love for Him&mdash;Exo. 21:5.</li>
	<li>Our serving the Lord should always proceed out from Him as the source of blessing, be through Him as the means and the power, and be unto Him for His glory&mdash; Rom. 11:36; cf. Num. 18:1.</li>

		<li>We need to serve as laboring priests of the gospel of God, saving sinners to offer them to God as acceptable sacrifices and eventually present them full-grown in Christ&mdash;Rom. 15:16; 12:1; Col. 1:28.</li>
		<li>We need to supply others with Christ as their spiritual food at the proper time&mdash;Matt. 24:45:

			<li>We need to desperately endeavor to build up a habit of speaking in any meeting&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26, 4-5, 12, 31.</li>

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom is the realm of life for life to move, rule, and govern so that life may accomplish its purpose, and this realm is the kingdom.</li>
		<li>The gospel brings in the divine life, and this life has its realm, which is the kingdom; the divine life with its realm produces the church&mdash;2 Tim. 1:10.</li>
		<li>The gospel of the kingdom brings forth the church because the kingdom is the life itself, and the church is the issue of life&mdash;Matt. 4:23; Acts 8:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom is the reality of the church; therefore, apart from the kingdom life, we cannot live the church life&mdash;Matt. 5:3; 16:18-19; Rev. 1:4-6, 9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5&mdash;7) is the content of the church life; without the reality of the kingdom, the church is empty.</li>
		<li>Since the kingdom life issues in the church life, as we live corporately in the kingdom life, we spontaneously live the church life&mdash;Rom. 14:17.</li>
		<li>A believer who does not live in the reality of the kingdom cannot be built into the structure of the church&mdash;Eph. 2:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Without the kingdom as the reality of the church, the church cannot be built up&mdash;Matt. 16:18-19:

		<li>The church is brought into being through the authority of the kingdom.</li>
		<li>The keys of the kingdom are given to make the building of the church possible&mdash;v. 19; 18:18; cf. John 20:23.</li>

	<li>Each time the Lord Jesus spoke of the church, He mentioned it in relation to the kingdom; this indicates how intimately the kingdom and the church are related&mdash;Matt. 16:18-19; 18:17-18:

		<li>Romans 14:17 proves that the church in this age is the kingdom of God.</li>
		<li><em>The kingdom of God</em> in 1 Corinthians 4:20 refers to the church life (v. 17), implying that in the sense of authority, the church in this age is the kingdom of God.</li>
		<li>The term <em>fellow citizens</em> in Ephesians 2:19 indicates the kingdom of God, the sphere wherein God exercises His authority.</li>
		<li>What Paul and his fellow workers were doing in the gospel work for the establishing of the churches was for the kingdom of God&mdash;Col. 4:11.</li>
		<li>The word <em>kingdom</em> in Revelation 1:6 reveals that where the church is, there the kingdom of God is; the church represents the kingdom.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the church as the kingdom, we are under the kingdom&rsquo;s rule, government, discipline, and exercise&mdash; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 5:5.</li>
	<li>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, at the same time we are both in the kingdom and in the church, in the treasure and in the pearl&mdash;Matt. 13:44-46.</li>
	<li>Although the church today is God&rsquo;s kingdom, we are in the kingdom in reality only when we live, walk, and have our being in the spirit, not in our natural man&mdash; Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16, 25.</li>
	<li>As those who are under the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we need to live a kingdom life in the church, growing and developing in the divine life until we reach maturity&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; 2 Pet. 1:5-11.</li>

		<li>In order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there is the need of spiritual fighting&mdash; Matt. 12:22-29.</li>

		</ol></li>
	<li>The church should pray to bring in the kingdom of God&mdash;Matt. 6:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The coming of the kingdom is not automatic; if there is no prayer, the kingdom cannot come.</li>
		<li>The prayer of the church is the most effective means of curbing Satan&mdash;16:19; 18:18.</li>
		<li>The church must be the outlet of heaven, allowing heaven&rsquo;s authority to be expressed on earth&mdash; 16:18-19; 18:17-18.</li>
		<li>Genuine prayer is a joint labor with God to bring His kingdom to the earth and to carry out His will on earth; hence, prayer is a spiritual battle&mdash;6:10; 2 Cor. 10:4; Eph. 6:12.</li>
		</ol></li>

	<li>A life under the kingdom&rsquo;s rule is a life of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit&mdash;Rom. 14:17; cf. 1 Cor. 12:3.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to enjoy the Lord as our reward in the kingdom age, we must be those who love His appearing&mdash; 2 Tim. 4:7-8, 18; Matt. 24:40-44:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to fight the good fight against Satan and his kingdom of darkness for the interests of God&rsquo;s kingdom (1 Tim. 6:12), run the course for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy according to His eternal purpose (Heb. 12:1), and keep the faith for participation in the divine riches in God&rsquo;s economy (1 Tim. 3:9; 2 Tim. 4:7).</li>
	<li>We need to be trained by the grace of God to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts that we may live a God-expressing and flesh-restricting life, awaiting the blessed hope of Christ&rsquo;s appearing in His glory&mdash;Titus 2:11-13.</li>
	<li>We need to determine to gain the honor of being well pleasing to the Lord by remaining under the constraint of His love to live to Him so that we can be rewarded by Him at His judgment seat&mdash;2 Cor. 5:9-15; Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12.</li>
	<li>We need to run the race by subduing our body to serve God&rsquo;s holy purpose so that we may win the Lord as our prize and not be disapproved and rejected by Him at His judgment seat&mdash;1 Cor. 9:24-27; 2 Cor. 5:10.</li>
	<li>We must be careful in our work not to mar God&rsquo;s building with the worthless materials of our natural man and our flesh; instead, we should build the church with the virtues and attributes of the Triune God to produce the New Jerusalem as a miraculous structure of treasure so that we may receive the reward of the kingdom&mdash;1 Cor. 3:12-17.</li>
	<li>At His second appearing Christ will be the morning star to His overcomers who watch for His coming; to all the others He will appear only as the sun&mdash;Rev. 2:28; Mal. 4:2.</li>
	<li>The entire Bible concludes with the desire for the Lord&rsquo;s coming expressed as a prayer&mdash;Rev. 22:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to enjoy the Lord as our reward in the kingdom age, we must preach the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age&mdash;Matt. 24:14; cf. 1 Cor. 9:27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The gospel of the kingdom emphasizes the heavenly ruling of God and the authority of the Lord&mdash;Matt. 28:18-20.</li>
	<li>The gospel of the kingdom is the sowing of Christ as the seed, the gene, of the kingdom of God into God&rsquo;s chosen people that He might grow in them, live in them, and be expressed from within them to develop into God&rsquo;s ruling realm&mdash;Mark 4:26-29.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s unique purpose in this age is to have the gospel preached that the church might be built up to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 3:8-11.</li>
	<li>The overcomers who preach the gospel of the kingdom become the riders of the white horse&mdash;Rev. 19:11, 13-14.</li>
	<li>The preaching of the gospel of the kingdom is the greatest sign of the end of this age.</li>
