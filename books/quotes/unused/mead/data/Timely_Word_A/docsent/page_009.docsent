   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Elders as Priests and Administrators</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, made this matter of God's administration in the New Testament very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He charged the brothers in Corinth to remove a certain sinful man from the fellowship of the church 5:13 , which is also the fellowship of the apostles and of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His desire was that this evil person would be removed from the church, but he would not do it by himself because he was not the direct administrator.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, he charged the ones who were the direct administrators in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the New Testament teaching and example, we can realize that some elders had been established in the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul gave such a charge to the brothers, but he did not carry out the administration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elders were the direct administrators of the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The written constitution of the New Testament kingdom of God is the teaching of the apostles, the complete New Testament, and the direct administrators in this kingdom are the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, in the New Testament age, there is still some instant speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament, we have the reality of the high priest and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Old Testament, the priests are one group, and the elders are another group.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in the New Testament, these two groups are one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the believers in Christ are priests to God 1 Pet 2:5; Rev 1:6 , including the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of the elders are priests, and Christ is the High Priest Heb 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know that He is seated at the right hand of God in the heavens Rom 8:34 , but we must see that for God's movement among us on this earth, our High Priest, Christ, is in us 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All of the elders need to declare that Christ, the High Priest, is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have such a High Priest Heb 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The elders, who are also the priests, should be the ones who administrate the church in God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there is a problem in the church under the administration of the elders, how shall they solve it?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament, it was necessary to study the law to find out what to do to solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is a problem in the church, we have to study our New Testament constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The United States is a good example of a country ruled by its Constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The highest power in the United States is neither the President nor the Congress.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the Constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of the power of the United States Constitution, President Nixon was forced to resign from office.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually, the Constitution is more powerful than the President.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must admit that today the highest power in the church is the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there is a problem in the church, we have to come to the New Testament to see what it says about this particular problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not say we are for or against something until we go to the New Testament constitution to see what it has to say.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When any problem arises, we must learn to be silent and go to the written Word of God, the New Testament constitution, without any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have a complete constitution with many more details than the United States Constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we cannot find anything in our written constitution directly concerning a certain problem or if we can find something and are not clear how to apply it, we need an instant speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The time and the way to carry out the written constitution still needs the Lord's instant speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can we have the Lord's instant speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to get into the presence of the Lord, stay in His presence, and wait on Him, asking Him to show us what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we have to read the breastplate with all its letters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The stones on the breastplate with the letters refer to the saints, God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to read the people of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By reading the people of the church in the presence of the Lord, with the Lord, and with His loving capacity typified by the breast, we will receive some instruction as to when and how to carry out what is in the written constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is to receive the instant speaking according to the written teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Of course, we should not do anything that is against the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Old Testament, no one was to do anything against the law, but to carry out the law, there was also the need of the instant speaking of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we have His instant speaking, we are not speaking our own word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we speak is not something of democracy or of autocracy, but it is of theocracy since God Himself is speaking instantly according to His written constitution to govern and rule His people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All of the elders of the church need to realize that they are the real priests.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are the elders and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As an elder, you have the High Priest within you, and you can share in His loving capacity as symbolized by His breast.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You love the saints with Christ's love and go into His presence with such a loving capacity, waiting on Him and reading the letters on the stones of the breastplate, that is, reading all the members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By reading the members of the church, taking the members as the letters of a divine typewriter, a word, a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph, and even a chapter will come to you, telling you what to do and how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must also remember the principle of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The elders are always in plurality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because the elders are in plurality, there is the need of much fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The genuine fellowship must be in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If any fellowship among the elders is not in the presence of the Lord, that is not genuine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, all the elders should exercise the practice of being in the presence of the Lord in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this kind of fellowship, surely the "Urim" and the "Thummim" in Christ's loving capacity would speak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then the elders would know what is on the heart of the Lord concerning His people and what He desires to administrate in their locality for the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The elders are both the priests receiving the instant word from God, and the administrators to administrate what they have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The principle in the Old Testament regarding God's administration is the same in the New Testament.</S>
