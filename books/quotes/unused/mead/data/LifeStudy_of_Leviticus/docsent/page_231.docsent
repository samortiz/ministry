   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE DEVOTIONS FOR A VOW 2 Scripture Reading: Lev 27:16-34</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue to consider the devotions for a vow in chapter twenty-seven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>D. The Devotion of a Field</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Leviticus 27:16-25 speaks of the devotion of a field.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A Part of a Field Sanctified to Jehovah to Be Valued according to the Seed Required</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"If a man sanctifies part of a field of his possession to Jehovah, then the valuation shall be according to the seed required for it: a homer of barley seed for fifty shekels of silver" v. 16 . This signifies that our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ as the rich land should be valued according to the seed of the divine life required for our spiritual increase.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A field sanctified, devoted, to Jehovah was to be valued according to the seed required.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose a piece of land was devoted thirty-five years before the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For each of these thirty-five years a certain amount of seed would be required.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The value of this piece of land would be higher than a piece of land devoted only twenty years before the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our interpretation of verse 16, we speak of our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The land typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, we should not interpret verse 16 as typifying the devoting of a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such an interpretation is neither meaningful nor logical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we cannot devote a part of Christ or devote our enjoyment of Christ, we can have a devotion that is related to the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The three previous devotions of ourselves, of our cattle, and of our houses are all for us to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more we have these three kinds of devotions, the more we shall be in a position to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, this chapter concludes that all our devotions consummate in the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ should be valued according to the seed of the divine life required for our spiritual increase.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the type, the more seed required, the higher was the value of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The valuation was according to the seed required for the period of time before the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our spiritual interpretation of this, "according to the seed required" actually denotes the prospect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose I devote something for the enjoyment of Christ as the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How should this devotion be valued?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This devotion should be valued according to its prospect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The greater the seed required, the greater is the prospect for increase.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The lesser the seed required, the lesser is the prospect for the increase of the number in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ will afford a greater prospect for the increase of the church, this devotion will be more valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if our devotion, our consecration, will afford only a limited prospect for increase, our devotion will not be as valuable as one that affords a greater prospect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps you are wondering why we interpret verse 16 this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason for this interpretation is the fact that seed is for increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand, the seed indicates the value of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, spiritually speaking, the seed indicates the life increase; it indicates multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may consecrate ourselves to the Lord, but our consecration may not afford very much prospect of the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If our consecration affords a greater prospect of the increase of the church, surely this consecration will be more valuable than one that does not have such a prospect.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let us take Paul as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Paul devoted himself for the enjoyment of Christ, that devotion had a great prospect of the increase of the church.</S>
