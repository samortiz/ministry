People will realize that you are a person in Christ, not in anything else. You live Christ, and you express Christ in your daily life; thus, what people see in you is Christ expressed by you. In Philippians 3:9 Paul expressed his desire to be found in Christ. He was a person who aspired to be found in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT HAVING OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS<br>WHICH IS OF THE LAW,<br>BUT THE RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH IS OF GOD<br>AND WHICH IS CHRIST</H2><P>If you are living Christ, you are a person absolutely in Christ. Whatever you do is Christ, and whatever you say is Christ. In this way Christ becomes your righteousness, which is considered in the Bible as God's righteousness. Christ is your love, kindness, and humility. Christ is everything in your virtues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAGNIFYING CHRIST BY THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY<br>OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</H2><P>When we experience Christ to such an extent, we magnify Christ, regardless of the environment, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19-20). The Spirit of Jesus Christ is simply the life-giving Spirit, who is Jesus Christ Himself. In this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the bountiful supply for our daily life. It is by this bountiful supply that we magnify Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORKING OUT OUR OWN SALVATION<br>BY LIVING CHRIST</H2><P>In Philippians 2:12 we are told to work out our own salvation. The salvation spoken of here is not the salvation which saves us from perdition. Rather, it is the salvation which saves us from our daily problems. If, as a husband, I cannot love my wife, that is a real problem. And if, as a wife, you cannot submit yourself to your husband, that is also a problem. Not being able to control our temper is another problem. From these kinds of problems we all need a daily salvation. We ourselves work out this daily salvation by living Christ. By living Christ we are saved, not only from losing our temper, but from every kind of shortcoming and weakness. Living Christ saves us from every defect and makes us perfect. We all need to experience this daily, subjective salvation.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Secret of Experiencing Christ &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
