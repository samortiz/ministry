   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 19 says, "And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This power is indeed great.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is so great that God must open our eyes before we can see its greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is so great that even the Ephesian saints did not know its magnitude.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is so great that they could not fathom it by themselves; they needed Paul to pray for them, so that God would grant them a spirit of wisdom and revelation and open the eyes of their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot say how great this power is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can only say that it is great; it is greater than what we think and what we know.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, we must never underestimate what is inside this earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to realize that there is a treasure within this earthen vessel 2 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do we believe this?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a treasure within this earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The treasure within this earthen vessel is so precious that even we ourselves are not clear how precious it is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, we see that this earthen vessel is an earthly tabernacle that will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But on the other hand, we see the surpassing greatness of the Lord's power toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's children must know what they received the minute they were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a man is regenerated, he receives the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The experience may only last a minute, but it takes thirty to forty years for a man to discover what he received during that one minute.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The experience of that one minute passes away quickly, but a man needs thirty to forty years to continually experience the great gift that he received during that one minute, and for God to open his eyes to see such a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From that minute on, the surpassing greatness of God's power begins to work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regeneration happens within a very short time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But those whose eyes are opened will agree that what they have is a life of eternity; this life will last for eternity, and there is a surpassing greatness to God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No child of God can fully comprehend the greatness of what he received at the moment of his regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But blessed are those who know a little more than others do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our growth does not depend on how much power we receive from the Lord, but on how much we see concerning the power we received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the instant we were regenerated, God put such a treasure within the earthen vessel, but we need a whole lifetime to discover the greatness of this treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need a whole lifetime to discover what kind of treasure this is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man sees no difference between the treasure he received on the day he was saved and the treasure he has ten or twenty years afterwards, he has not made any progress.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although he has lived ten or twenty years as a Christian, he is the same as a newborn baby.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God desires that we see the surpassing greatness of His power toward us through the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whether we are strong or weak depends on how much we see.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who see are strong, and those who do not see are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The strong ones are not those who have received, and the weak ones are not those who have not received; we have all received.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The question today is whether or not we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God works within us not because we ask Him for this or for that.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has given us everything that can be given; everything is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today we need to ask God to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we can see.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who see have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the past, many saints experienced a spiritual breakthrough not by receiving a puff of power from God, but by waking up in themselves and exclaiming, "Thank the Lord, all these things are mine."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They did not beg again and again for what they did not have.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, they saw that they had everything, and they uttered thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who have never seen this do not know the surpassing greatness of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How great is this power?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul said that it is "according to the operation of the might of His strength."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should take note of the words "according to."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to realize that the power which is toward those who believe is according to the operation of the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, the power that operates in the church is as great as the might of strength that operated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The might of strength which God operates in us is as great as the might of strength which He operated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not know if you have seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you have not seen this, you need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You should not think that you are all right, just because you have read the book of Ephesians a few times and can memorize 1:19 and 20.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether or not you can memorize them does not count; what counts is the revelation and the seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul prayed that we might see the surpassing greatness of God's power given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have not seen that the power in us is the same as the power that is in Christ, we still need to pray for the seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the power that is manifested in us does not match the power that is manifested in Christ, we have to confess that there are still things we have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to admit humbly that there are still many things we have not seen, and that God has to show them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But whether or not we have seen them, the fact remains: the power that is in those who believe in Christ is as great as the power that is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank the Lord that this is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May the Lord open our eyes so that we would truly see.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not ask God to transmit more power to us from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We only need to ask God to help us discover and see more of what we have within us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If God opens our eyes and we see, we will praise Him for what we already have.</S>
