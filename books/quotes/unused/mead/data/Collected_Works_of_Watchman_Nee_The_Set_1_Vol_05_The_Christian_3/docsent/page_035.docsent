   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"The Holy One, the true One."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord does not reveal Himself here in the same way that He revealed Himself to the other messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"The Holy One, the true One."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not the same as the glory which He has in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is what His faithful saints know Him by in His moral virtues during this period.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sardis was too much into the creeds, but Philadelphia longs after the Lord in whom she believes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The apostle did not say, "I know what I have believed," but "I know whom I have believed" 2 Tim 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the source of faith and love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Indeed the person of the Lord Jesus is more outstanding in this letter than in others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus reveals Himself in this letter more than in any other letter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before He mentions anything else, He first mentions Himself as the Holy and true One.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other letters, the Lord did not reveal His own virtues this way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Formerly, He only revealed His own magisterial nature to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not the same here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The question here is not one of a church satisfying the demands of a judge, but a church matching the heart and nature of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only holiness and truthfulness are compatible with the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the Lord unveils Himself as the Holy and true One.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is spoken of here is what is in the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He tells us of what He is personally and what He expects the church to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What He is in Himself, He will work into His church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is covered here is the expression and demand given by the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He tells us how the Word of God is absolutely moral and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He acts according to God's revelation and is faithful to God inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He works faithfully according to what He declares in Himself until the works are completed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must not forget that this revelation of the Lord is eternal; it is given to the saints of today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unless we match His holiness and truthfulness, we will not please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must match His nature and must be compatible with the words that He declares and is about to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we set before us the Christ who is holy and true, we will surely depart in our heart from everything corrupt and formal, for we are drawing close to One who is absolutely opposed to these things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the Holy One of God and does not have even a trace of defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He knows no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet for us He became sin 2 Cor 5:21 , that God may be glorified in His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now He has resurrected and ascended as "the Holy One" Acts 13:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All along He was without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet for man's sin, He did the work of purging sin by dying the death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, when He stood in the place of the sinner, God rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when He died, the sinner no longer bore any history before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man is judged in the flesh already.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All those who give place to the flesh oppose God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All genuine desires for the pursuit of holiness in the believers are works of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But lately, this kind of pursuit in many ways has come short of the mind of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people have made excuse with expressions such as "sanctification by faith" and "sanctification in Christ" and have tolerated many things that are contrary to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such toleration is to give place to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God wants us to realize experientially that our old man has been judged and annihilated in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He wants us to see that He is "the Holy One" in resurrection and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are resurrected in Him already.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we have His Holy Spirit and have become a heavenly new man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will deliver us from our self and will turn us away from the self as the focus, so that we will be joined with the heavenly Christ in mind and in love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is also "the true One."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is no longer true.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She has lost her significance in being a testimony of the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Her reality no longer matches her name.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, Christ is still true.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whatever He does, whatever office He holds, whatever name He acquires, and whatever He is, does, or says to God and to man are absolutely true and real.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is the true God, the true light, the true bread, the true vine, and the true Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Both as God and as man, He encompasses and expresses everything true.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whatever aspect we can ascribe to Him, He is true in that aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has blessed the world in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Man does not need to find anything apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He has become our wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no discrepancy between His aspiration and His reality.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our life on earth today is just the experience of all that is in Him as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The saints here are the saints who keep the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When God's word is honored in this way, Christ's own character will rule over man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When His command becomes our mark, He Himself will control our love.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the eyes receive the light, the whole body is enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's word connects us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this way, we have a "written Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Of course, the most important thing is to first receive the living Christ for salvation, then understand this Christ through the written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we receive the testimony of the Holy Spirit for Christ, our heart will be closely drawn to "the Holy" and "the true" One.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way, the Christ seen from the Word of God will gain our love, and we will no longer want to depart from the written Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Only by having a living relationship with the living Christ can we be preserved from deception.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A holy Christ, in whom is the truth the reality , is the best protector of our spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A lifeless Christianity has no power to prevent any deception.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When a church is no longer able to separate itself in a simple way, when it has no more faith to cut off help from the world, and when there is confusion everywhere, only a Christ who is holy and true can come forth to lead His people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The apostle said to Timothy, "And that from a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus" 2 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Surely there is no knowledge better than the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This in fact is the key point in the first Epistle of John.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only this Epistle tells us that the Lord Jesus is the Holy and true One.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The fathers who are in Christ "know Him who is from the beginning" 1 John 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They can tell others what the true Christ is like.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They know Him as "the Holy One, the true One."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What we need is not strange and novel inventions, but to return to the One who was in the beginning, the Christ being revealed at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The need of this age is to return to the purity in Christ, to know what kind of Christ He is that is revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What we lack is not the Christ invented by church history and by the present age, but the Christ who was there from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If our hearts are joined to the Christ recorded in the Bible, then the Christ we love now will be the Christ whom we are waiting for and the Christ who will come to take us away.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Indeed there is no living Christ apart from the written Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord has revealed His own holiness and reality truth .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>No one can draw near to Him without separating himself from the sin He hates and submitting to the truth He reveals.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God's word is separating.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is also edifying.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>To depart from all sins marks one's acceptance of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>True acceptance of God's word means that one walks according to the word and not according to the conscience of the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is the mark of our entry into the holy of holies.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Only those who are in His light can see light.</S>
