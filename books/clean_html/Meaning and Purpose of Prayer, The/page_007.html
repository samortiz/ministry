<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF PRAYER<br />
BEING TO CO-WORK WITH GOD</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we said that prayer is for man to absorb God and for man to express God. Every prayer that touches God has these two aspects. On the one hand, we absorb God by contacting Him. On the other hand, by contacting and absorbing God, we let Him express Himself within us; that is, we utter genuine prayers. In this chapter we will continue to consider prayer. Real prayers include more than the aspects of absorbing God and expressing Him. Absorbing and expressing God in prayer are actually our preparation for prayer that enables us to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose in prayer. Hence, we will now consider how God&rsquo;s purpose is fulfilled in prayer.</p>
<p>A person who knows how to pray is a man of prayer who co-works with God. We may say that the purpose of prayer is to co-work with God. Our prayer is not only to absorb God and express Him but also to co-work with God, that is, to work together with Him. For example, suppose I am standing at the podium with a brother who translates, and while I give the message, he translates. When we coordinate in this way, we are co-working, working together. If I do not speak, he cannot translate, and if he does not translate, I have no way to give the message. The two of us echo each other by working on the same thing together. This is co-working, coordinating. This example helps us understand the meaning of co-working and coordinating.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the brother who translates can coordinate with me very well, and he is completely one with me. When I sway a little, he sways in the same way while he translates. He repeats my gestures. When I raise my voice, he raises his voice. When I speak slowly, he speaks slowly. When I am serious, he is also serious. He is just like me. The two of us are like one man; hence, others see perfect coordination and co-working. This is the way that we should coordinate and co-work with God in prayer.</p>
<p>We often think that the purpose of prayer is to ask God to work, to do things. However, the purpose of prayer is for us to work, to do things, with God, that is, to co-work with God.</p>
<p>The verses in the Scripture Reading show a principle. If man does not pray, God will not work; if no one prays, God has no work to do. At any given time God must find some people or a person to co-work with Him to pray for what He intends to do on earth. If no one prays, God does not have a co-worker, and He cannot work. For example, if I do not have a translator to translate my Mandarin into Cantonese when I give a message in Hong Kong, then I do not have a co-worker, and therefore I cannot give a message. I must wait until a translator becomes my co-worker before I can give a message. Conversely, if I do not give a message, the translator has nothing to translate. In God&rsquo;s work those who pray function not only as a translator but also as a speaker. For example, the translator will translate as much as I speak, and he will say what I say. Likewise, in an effective prayer, God accomplishes what we pray for, and He accomplishes as much as we pray for. Our prayer can be compared to giving a message, and God&rsquo;s work can be compared to translating. The extent to which we pray is the extent to which God works. Those whom we touch in prayer are those on whom God works, what we pray for is what God does, and how we pray is how God fulfills. This is a great principle of prayer.</p>
<p>For this reason, prayer is a dignified matter in the sight of God. God needs our prayer to lead His work. The extent of our prayer is the extent of His work, and what we pray about is what God does. It seems that our prayer leads God&rsquo;s work and that His work follows our prayer. If we are lacking God&rsquo;s work, we are lacking prayer. If we do not see God saving people, we are not praying for people to be saved. If we do not see God moving in the church, we are not praying for His move. God does not work when man does not pray. The extent of God&rsquo;s work depends on the extent of our prayer. When we pray a little, God can only work a little. If God is not working much, it is because man is not praying much. We should never think that God&rsquo;s work precedes our prayer. Our prayer takes the lead, and God&rsquo;s work follows. The key lies with us. If we pray, God will work, but if we do not pray, He will not work.</p>
<p>Since prayer is so important, real prayer must contact, absorb, and express God. Otherwise, it is not real prayer, and it will not move God to work. Prayer that does not touch or express God is man&rsquo;s expression, not God&rsquo;s expression. Such prayer is out of the self, not out of God. As a result, man may pray, but God will not work. Although man wants God to work, He will not; hence, such prayer is of no avail. If we want God&rsquo;s work to follow our prayer and to fulfill the extent of our prayer, then our prayer must touch, absorb, and express God. This is the way for our prayer to be God&rsquo;s expression. In such prayer God is praying in us. This is our co-working with God, that is, our working together with God. Then the extent of our prayer is the extent to which God will work. Hence, in real prayer God follows man. Prayer that does not cause God to follow is not real prayer and is not of much value.</p>
