<h1 class="title">JUSTIFICATION</h1>
<p>Justification is a key item in God&rsquo;s full salvation. After obtaining the forgiveness of sins and the cleansing away of sins, and after being sanctified, we have no further problems before God. God then has the position and the ground to justify us. This is another crucial link in our enjoyment of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUSTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;For the showing forth of His righteousness... that He should be just and justify the one who is of the faith of Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:26).</p>
<p>In the Bible, justification means that God, according to His righteousness, declares man righteous. In other words, God justifies man according to the standard of His righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. OBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...shall be justified before Him [God]&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:20).</p>
<p> God&rsquo;s justification is in two aspects, the objective and the subjective. Objective justification is our being justified positionally according to the righteousness which we received from God (Phil. 3:9); it is our being justified by having Christ as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30). We obtain this justification by reason of the following four items:</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. By the Grace of God</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Being justified freely by His [God&rsquo;s] grace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:24).</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s being justified by God is, first, by God&rsquo;s grace. God&rsquo;s justifying us by His grace is His freely fulfilling all His righteous requirements for us. This justification can be accepted and received by everyone without human effort and without price; therefore, it is grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Through the Redemption of Christ Jesus</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Being justified...through the redemption in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:24).</p>
<p>God can justify us by His grace through the redemption of Christ Jesus. Apart from the shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus on the cross to accomplish redemption for us and to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, there is no ground and no way for God to justify us by His grace, even if He desires to do so. However, because on the cross the Lord Jesus shed His precious blood, paid the price, and satisfied all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness upon us (Rom. 5:9), God is able to justify us by His grace according to His righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Through Our Faith in Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Yet knowing that a man is not justified by works of law, but through the faith of Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:16).</p>
<p>Man is justified by God not only by God&rsquo;s grace and through the redemption of Christ Jesus, but also through his faith in Christ. Both the grace of God and the redemption of Christ Jesus are on God&rsquo;s side, whereas the faith in Jesus Christ is on our side. By His grace, and through the redemption of Christ Jesus, God would justify us and can justify us; yet for us to be justified by God, there is still the need of our faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Proven by the Resurrection and<br />
Ascension of Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;Who [Jesus]...was raised because of our justification&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 4:25).</p>
<p>The resurrection of Christ is a proof of our justification. The death of Christ satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements that God may justify us. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is God&rsquo;s justification and approval of His work; hence, it is also a proof of His work.</p>
<p><strong>2) &ldquo;...concerning righteousness, because I [Christ] go to the Father&rdquo;</strong> (John 16:10).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s ascension to the Father in heaven after He was resurrected is also a proof of our justification, even as the third stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #20 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Father God, Thou hast accepted<br />
 Jesus as our Substitute;<br />
Judged the Just One for the unjust,<br />
 Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?<br />
As a proof of perfect justice,<br />
 At Thine own right hand He sits;<br />
He, as Thy full satisfaction,<br />
 Righteously Thy need befits.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, ascension, and being seated at the right hand of God are a proof of our justification by God, confirming that God has justified us because of Christ&rsquo;s death, which satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
