<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California, from August 4 through September 2, 1964. This second edition is the revised edition published in 2005 in <em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>The following chapters are the messages given in the 1964 summer conference in Los Angeles. The spoken form has been retained. The author would urge all the readers to give their attention to the spiritual reality conveyed in these messages rather than to the language itself.</p>
<p>The word <em>economy</em> used in the title of this book may sound somewhat strange to the reader. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s economy&rdquo; is a quotation from 1 Timothy 1:4. <em>Economy</em> is the anglicized form of the Greek word <em>
oikonomia,</em> which denotes primarily a household management, a household administration, arrangement, distribution, or dispensation (of wealth, property, affairs, etc.). It is used with the intention of stressing the focal point of God&rsquo;s divine enterprise, which is to distribute, or dispense, Himself into man.</p>
<p>The three persons in the Godhead are for God&rsquo;s economy, the divine distribution, the holy dispensation. The Father as the source is embodied in the Son, and the Son as the course is realized in  the Spirit as the transmission. God the Father is a Spirit (John 4:24), and God the Son, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). All is in God the Spirit, who is the Holy Spirit revealed in the New Testament. This Holy Spirit today, with the fullness of the Father in the riches of the Son, has come into our human spirit and dwells there to impart all that God is into our very being. This is God&rsquo;s economy, the divine dispensation. The Holy Spirit of God, dwelling in our human spirit to dispense all that God is in Christ into our being, is the focus, the very mark, of this mysterious distribution of the Triune God. This is the battleground of the spiritual warfare. How much the subtle enemy has been and still is distracting the saints of God, even the seeking ones, from this mark of God&rsquo;s economy by many good and even scriptural things! In such a time of confusion, as in the time when the Epistles to Timothy were written, we must be narrowed down and even zeroed in to the all-inclusive divine Spirit in our human spirit that we may be kept from missing the mark of the divine economy. Therefore, returning to, abiding in, and exercising our spirit to realize the Spirit of God are fundamentally necessary today. It is by so doing that we can partake of all the fullness of God by enjoying the unsearchable riches of Christ. May the Lord grant us grace that we may be brought into such a realization and practice it in our daily life and in all that we do.</p>
<p>For a proper application and better result, all the chapters in this book need to be read with a praying spirit. It will be more profitable to pray-read all the quotations of the Scriptures in every chapter and always accompany the reading with prayer. May the Lord&rsquo;s presence with His sweet anointing within be realized by all the readers in their reading of these chapters in the spirit.</p>
