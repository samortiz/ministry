[1]  Today we come to the question of how a person deals with his past after believing in the Lord.
[2]  After believing in the Lord, a person still carries many things of the past with him.
[3]  The entire Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, but especially the New Testament, shows that God does not pay attention to what a person does before he believes in the Lord.
[4]  Even the Epistles, which touch on our wrongdoings in the past, mainly tell us what we should do hereafter, not what we should do about our past.
[5]  The books of Ephesians, Colossians, and 1 Thessalonians all cover something about our past, but they do not tell us how we should terminate our past; they only tell us how we should go on.
[6]  "And you, though dead in your offenses and sins, in which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience; among whom we also all conducted ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest; but God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ" Eph 2:1-5 .
[7]  "This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness...that you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality."
[8]  In reading the New Testament, I have spent much time to find out how one should terminate his past after believing in the Lord.
[9]  "And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver" Acts 19:19 .
[10]  Suppose I stole a thousand dollars from someone before I was saved.
[11]  If I have not dealt with the matter clearly, how can I preach the gospel to that person after I am saved?
[12]  No doubt, I have received forgiveness from God, but I do not have a proper testimony before man.
[13]  I cannot say, "Since God has forgiven me, it does not matter whether or not I repay him."
[14]  Please remember that in the course of giving your testimony, you may be affected by personal problems.
