Although no one likes to hear the word "fall," we need to realize that the falls portrayed in the book of Genesis are the background of a very positive picture which shows what God has done with the fallen human race. The main purpose of the record of Genesis is not to show the fall, but to show how much God's grace can do for fallen people. The fall is a black background which helps us see a white picture. Without the black background, the white picture would not be so impressive. In Genesis 3 we saw man's first fall and what God did for fallen mankind. In Genesis 4 we saw man's second fall and something further which God did for the fallen people. In this message we shall see what God did as a result of man's third fall.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Way of Salvation<br>from the Third Fall</H2><P>As we consider the third fall of man, we shall see more of what God has done for fallen people. After the first fall, Adam and Eve were saved. It is not a small thing to be saved. Although Adam and Eve were fallen, they nevertheless were saved. Adam said, "Living," and Eve said, "I have acquired." Adam and Eve were not saved by themselves, but by Christ who is the Lamb of God and the seed of woman. After seeing how God dealt with Adam and Eve, we saw that Abel offered sacrifice and gifts to God (Heb. 11:4). Sacrifice was offered for his sins, and gifts were presented for God's pleasure. Can a fallen man please God? Abel was a fallen man, but he pleased God. He was not only saved, he also satisfied God. Abel did not please God by and with himself; he pleased God by and with Christ. We go from Adam to Abel and from Abel to Enosh. Enosh initiated the matter of calling on the name of the Lord to enjoy all His riches. With the case of Enosh, it was not just a matter of salvation or of pleasing God, but of calling on the Lord that man might enjoy all that He is. As we proceed from Genesis 4 to Genesis 5, we find even more riches. In chapter five we learn that the saved ones lived, begat, and walked with God. After all of this, there is still more in chapter six. In Genesis 6 we see that Noah certainly was saved, pleased God, called on the name of the Lord, and enjoyed all that He is. Noah also lived and begat, for he begat three sons. In addition to all of these positive aspects of the life of the saved ones, Genesis 6 shows us even more items.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_181.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_183.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 182</div><br></body></html>
