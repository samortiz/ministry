   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT FOR DOCTRINES, FORMS, OR PRACTICES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must see some of the practical lessons of the church life that we may know how to behave in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we leave the denominations and come to the ground of unity, we must learn immediately that we are not for any doctrine, form, or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are absolutely for Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can never stress this point too much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not here for anything but Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not here for any doctrine, form, or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why must I emphasize this one thing?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is because this helps to deliver us from our different opinions in these three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is so easy to have different opinions regarding doctrines, forms, and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose you are in Sacramento and you leave the denomination that you are in. You discover that a group of believers are meeting on the proper ground in Sacramento and you proceed to meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose, then, that you find there something that you do not agree with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may pray-read very loudly, and you may feel that you simply cannot go along with that.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What then would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must remember that on the proper ground we do not stand for any doctrine, form, or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We only stand for Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must not care whether they have pray-reading or something else.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as it is not sinful, it is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If they minister Christ as life, we will receive the proper help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must not oppose or impose anything, but simply minister Christ as life to them in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When you go to a church and simply minister Christ as life, you will be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If they do something which you do not like, you must not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever they do, you should not care.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All you must seek to do is to minister Christ as life to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The longer you stay there, the more the church will be nourished, strengthened, and built.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the saints there will be so happy that the Lord has sent you to them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you go there to criticize their pray-reading and everything they do, you will only damage yourself and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will really frustrate the fellowship in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all must realize that on the church ground, we are here for nothing but Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not for any doctrine, form, or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>NEVER ADJUST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another lesson we must learn is never to adjust others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as their behavior is not sinful, we should leave them alone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be sinful is one thing, and to be wrong is another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For instance, the best time for us to meet during the weekdays may be 7:30 P.M. But suppose the leading brothers decide to have the meeting at 7:00 P.M. This may be wrong, but it is not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose that such a decision is made.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Would you say anything?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Could you come joyfully without saying a word?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may say that this is asking too much, but we need something which is too much to test us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will know where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is far too easy for us to criticize and say something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is really difficult to be quiet in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The car you drive can be driven in your way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if you are not behind the steering wheel, you must allow others to drive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We think that if only we were in the position of responsibility, everything would be right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the Lord has sovereignly placed others in this position.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a test to see if you are really for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may say that the leading brothers in your church are not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But I can tell you that every leading brother is not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is not one exception.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you cannot go along with those where you are, you will never be able to go along with those in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Wherever we are in a local church, regardless of how wrong they are, we must go along with them as long as they are not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, if the leading brothers put up an idol and say that we all must worship it, we must stand against this because it is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To hold something which is sinful is one thing, but to do something which is wrong is another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is rather difficult to ascertain the standard of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What is the standard for right, and what is the standard for wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is really difficult to know.</S>
