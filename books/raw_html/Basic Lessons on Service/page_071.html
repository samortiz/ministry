<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Merely Keeping the Lord's Gift,<br>Neither Losing It nor Gaining a Profit by Using It</H2><P>Merely to keep the Lord's gift and not lose it is not sufficient; we must gain a profit by using it. In this lesson we do not need to get into the full interpretation of this parable, because we can ask the saints to read some of the Life-study Messages in Matthew. But we must stress to them that actually to hide our gift in the earth is not to use it. The earth refers to the worldly things. As long as we do not use our gift, we are hiding it.</P><P>We have to point out these three dangers: mistreating fellow believers, keeping company with worldly people, and not using our gift to do the Lord's service. We have to point out that many are hiding their gift, not using their gift, because they do not serve.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE LOSS:</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Be Cut Off from the Lord<br>at His Coming Back&#151;<br>to Be Separated from the Lord<br>in His Coming Glory</H2><P>When the Lord comes back, He will come in glory. In other words, He will be clothed in His glory. The unfaithful ones who did not use their gifts will be cut off from His glory at His coming back (Matt. 24:51). They will have no share in His coming glory. For a full interpretation of this, we need to read the appropriate Life-study Messages on Matthew.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Be Chastened Dispensationally</H2><P>To be cut off from the coming glory of the Lord is a dispensational chastisement.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth</H2><P>The ones who are chastised will be in weeping and gnashing of teeth. Weeping indicates regret, and gnashing of teeth indicates self-blame. We do not know what this chastisement will be like, but we know that it will be a suffering.</P>
