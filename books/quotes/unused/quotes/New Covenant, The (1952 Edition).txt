In his Second Overcomer Conference in October 1931, Watchman Nee gave seven messages on the truth of the new covenant
These messages were initially published in Watchman Nee's magazine, The Present Testimony, Issues 23-26, 32-33, and 36
Before Watchman Nee's imprisonment in 1952, his Gospel Book Room in Shanghai published a more polished edition of these messages
We can also have direct fellowship with God and a deeper inward knowledge of Him because we have the new covenant
If anyone belonging to the Lord does not know what the new covenant is, he will be unable to know God's eternal purpose experientially
It was not until Christ that the age of grace came and there was the new covenant, thus enabling us to see God's eternal purpose
We need to know the new covenant, for only in so doing can we expect God's eternal purpose to be accomplished in us
In the beginning, in the Garden of Eden, we see the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Although no one has ever seen God, there is one Person, the only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father, who has declared Him
Hebrews 8:8 tells us clearly that one day God will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah
Strictly speaking, this covenant will not be set up until 'after those days' , referring to the beginning of the millennium
He established the new covenant with His blood so that we can have a foretaste of the blessings of the new covenant
We shall go on to see what God's covenant and the new covenant are, and what the characteristics of the content of the new covenant are
In other words, there are those portions which speak of God's requirements and those which speak of God's grace
These are the things which God delights to give to us and which He has accomplished for us; this is the grace which God has bestowed upon us
Promise means that God will do something for man, while fact means that God has already done something for man
The next morning B did come to A's house to do the work and also to give him some money to buy the things he needed
If a person does not fulfill the condition mentioned here, he will not receive the promised blessing of well-being and long life
We need to ask God to fulfill His promise; that is, the promise requires prayer in order that it may be fulfilled
If a man is unfaithful towards God's promise and does not fulfill the conditions accompanying it, the promise may be revoked
We must pray until the Spirit of God is so stirred in us that we feel deeply that this promise is intended of God for us
We come to God through prayer and ask Him to act according to His faithfulness and righteousness and fulfill His promise in us
Later, when she encountered difficulties and trials, she read this word back to God and even read it to herself
There were some children of God who at a certain stage of their spiritual life were brought into the experience of Psalm 66
On the one hand it seemed as though, 'Thou broughtest us into the net; thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins
On the other hand God also gave them the promise: 'We went through fire and through water; but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place'
Time tests man, but God's promises enable man to pass through the test of time and remain standing 'unto this present hour' and 'until now'
Though heaven and earth may be consumed and the mountains and hills fall, he who believes in the Lord shall see His words fulfilled
Concerning God's facts, although we cannot find the word facts in the Scriptures, yet in God's work we find many accomplished facts
We can never say that we have received God's facts and then say that we need to wait a few years for God to give them to us
What God has accomplished and what He has already given to us in Christ can never be postponed to some future time
We ought to take an attitude towards Satan that we have been raised up together and that we have ascended together with Christ
We must know that there is not one of the Lord's people who has not received a life of resurrection and ascension
If we consider that this life can only be obtained by our asking for it, we do not know what God has accomplished
Hallelujah, this glorious fact, this accomplished fact, this fact which Christ has accomplished, has been given to us by God in Christ!
The phrase, 'that the body of sin might be made of none effect' may also be rendered, 'that the body of sin may become unemployed'
The result is that the more he asks God to crucify his old man, the more his old man seems to be active, exercising dominion over him
God says that their old man has been crucified with Christ, but they think that God's promise is that He will crucify their old man
Whenever they commit sin, they feel that their old man has not been crucified, and they ask God once again to crucify their old man
We must ask the Spirit of the Lord to give us the revelation so that we may see that our old man has been crucified with Christ
We need to realize that it is not because we believe, that God's fact becomes real, but because God's fact is real, therefore, we believe
Faith means that since God says our old man has been crucified with Christ, we also say that our old man has been crucified with Christ
From what we have seen in the previous examples there are the following principles: We need to discover what God's fact is
Once we see what God's fact is, we need to hold on to God's Word and believe that we are just as God's Word says
We need by faith on one hand to praise God that we are this way; on the other hand we need to act and manifest that we are such
Whenever temptation or trial comes to us, we must believe that God's Word and His fact are more dependable than our feelings
God's fact is in Christ; therefore, we must be in Christ in order to enjoy the fact which God has accomplished in Christ
Since they do not stand by faith upon the position which God has given them in Christ, they lose the effect which God's fact has toward them
We have mentioned repeatedly that Gods fact is something which He has already accomplished and that we do not need to ask Him to do anything
If we have not seen God's fact as fact, we need to ask God to give us revelation, to give us light, that we may see
We do not ask that God will do that very thing again, but that He may show us that He has already accomplished that thing
Since she was one who had repented and had been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, she was included in those who were 'afar off'
We need not ask God to put us now into Christ, but we do need to ask God to show us that He has already put us into Christ
We do not need to ask God to crucify our old man, but we do need to ask God to show us that He has crucified us with Christ
Whenever we have the inner revelation, we can spontaneously believe and then spontaneously have the experience
We must receive Gods promise with our faith while we must not only receive Gods fact with our faith but also enjoy what God has accomplished
When we read God's Word, one of the most important things is to differentiate which is God's promise and which is God's fact
We also need to ask God to grant us grace, making us willing to lay down our selves so that we may quietly look unto Him
Those who really have a promise from God usually behave and act in a peaceful and stable way, as if the promise had come true
And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he brake it, and began to eat'
A saint has said that every promise of God is built upon four pillars: God's justice, God's holiness, God's grace, and God's truth
All those who have been taught by grace will praise God and say, 'How great and precious it is for God to make a covenant with man'!
God not only gives us the promise which He will soon fulfill; He also grants us the fact which He has already accomplished
He has truly put the treasure in earthen vessels to manifest that the excellency of the power is of God and not of ourselves
God has not only given us His promise and the fact which He has accomplished in Christ; God has even made a covenant with us
The reason God is willing to lose His liberty by the covenant is that we may obtain what He intended us to obtain
The Most High God, the Creator of heaven and earth, condescended to such an extent to make a covenant with man
As far as God's willingness to be bound in making a covenant with man is concerned, the covenant is the highest expression of God's grace
From the covenant with Noah we see that one of the most difficult things for God is that of causing man to understand His intention
Take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them'
All creatures of flesh and blood upon the earth-the fowls, the cattle, the beasts, the reptiles, and the whole human race-died
Man could not understand or see; therefore, God gave man a covenant, so that he might have some evidence to cling to
In saving his nephew Lot and refusing the offer of the King of Sodom Abraham manifested his love his zeal his bravery and his cleanness
God said, 'This man shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir
Because Abraham could not believe, God made a covenant with him so that he could do nothing else but believe Him
He took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not
It means that the covenant which He made was something which went through the deepest inward parts and through the blood
The bodies of the sheep and oxen were divided, the blood was shed, and God went through the halves of the oxen and the sheep
It is in Psalm 89 where we find that when the Lord sent the prophet Nathan to David, what he spoke to David was a covenant
In this we see how God delights that man pray by holding on to the pledge which He has given man, namely, the covenant
In Psalm 143:1 we read: 'Hear my prayer, O Jehovah; give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness'
Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying
Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David'
It seemed that God's promise had become void, and that God had forsaken the covenant which He had made with David
It seems, the psalmist was reminding God: 'Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness'?
A person who fears God is one who seeks God's will with a full heart, with the intention of completely submitting to God's way
Those who are lazy, careless, double-minded, proud, and complacent can never expect God to reveal His secret to them
Besides these covenants, there is the one God made with us through the Lord Jesus Christ, which is often referred to as the new covenant
Although there are many covenants, the most important are the one which God made with Abraham and the one called the new covenant
Strictly speaking, the old covenant began from Exodus 19 and continued until the time of the death of the Lord Jesus
If the children of Israel would keep the law, God would bless them; if they broke the law, God would punish them
As far as the nature of the first covenant is concerned, 'the law is holy' , 'the law is spiritual' , and 'the law is good'
Paul's experience also tells us that the law itself is spiritual, but the law could not perform, in that it was weak through the flesh
In other words, in the new covenant, the One who demands of us is God, and the One who enables us to do the will of God is also God!
The new covenant enables man to know God more deeply and in an inward way, without being taught by his fellow citizen
We have seen before that the word of grace which God has given us includes God's promises, God's facts, and God's covenants
Wherefore God, willing to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His counsel, intervened by an oath'
The word covenant has two meanings in the Scriptures: first it is a covenant, or contract, and second it is a testament, or will
We cannot say that all of God's promises are His covenants, but we dare to say that all of God's covenants include His promises
A covenant differs from God's promise and God's fact, but a covenant also includes God's promise and God's fact
When speaking of the new covenant age we must ask three questions: With whom did God originally establish the new covenant?
In determining the time when the new covenant was made, we must take into account the words in Jeremiah 31:31 which say, 'The days come'
Although the term 'new covenant' was written in the book of Jeremiah, still for several hundred years it was not mentioned
We can say that You have opened the heavenly, spiritual treasure store, and You have bequeathed all the treasures to those whom You love
The Lord is building us up today by the principle of the new covenant and blessing us with the blessing of the new covenant
We know that the Lord shed His blood not only for our redemption, but also for the establishing of the new covenant
According to our spiritual experience, God first makes propitiation for our unrighteousnesses and forgives our sins
In Matthew 26:28 we read, 'For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins'
If man would abide by the words of this covenant God would bless him if man would not abide by the words of this covenant he would be cursed
Man was formerly under the dominion of death, because death reigned; but now he was also under the power of sin, because sin reigned
We have seen that from Adam to Moses death reigned and that from Moses to Christ not only did death reign, but sin also reigned
Due to the fact that the Lord Jesus shed His blood we have been washed from our sins, and we do not have to die
He has also restored our relationship with God so that all God has given and will give to us can become ours without hindrance
The blood of bulls and goats, upon which the people of the Old Testament depended, only reminded them of sin every year
Christ, through His own blood entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, having found an eternal redemption
The blood is the base upon which the covenant is established, while the covenant is the contract established with the blood
Romans 521 says That as sin reigned in death so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord
The blood of Christ has become the foundation of righteousness, so that the covenant God has made with us will not become void
God's Word says, 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
If we have truly confessed our sin, we should not care for our feeling; nor should we care for what others say about us
We praise God that He loves us and has had mercy toward us to such an extent that He cannot treat us in any way other than righteousness
When, by the blood of the Lord Jesus, we ask God to give His blessings to us according to the covenant, God cannot be unrighteous
Now we can ask God to accomplish upon us all that is in the covenant according to the value of the blood which is before Him
We can ask God to treat us according to the value of the blood before Him and according to the covenant which the Lord made with His blood
To pray according to the covenant is not to pray without basis, but to claim what God has given us in the covenant
When we come to God through the new covenant established by the blood, many times we just need to claim and not to ask
A brother who knows the Lord has said that since the time of Golgotha all the asking in the Scriptures should be changed to taking
Brothers and sisters, we must remember that through the blood we are asking God to give us that to which we are entitled
Sometimes we can reverently speak to God in this manner, 'God, we ask You to remember Your covenant, Your promised word
The new covenant was established with the blood of the Lord Jesus; therefore, the new covenant is secure and dependable
Standing, standing, Standing on the promises of God my Savior; Standing, standing, I'm standing on the promises of God
We also pointed out that the word 'testament' in Hebrews 9:16 is the same word for 'covenant' in the original text
As far as God is concerned, He has made a covenant with us; but as far as the Lord Jesus is concerned, He has left us a testament
We have said that the new covenant includes three major parts: the cleansing, life and power, and the inward knowledge
Now, through the blood of the Lord Jesus, this covenant has become our inheritance so that we can enjoy all its contents
Through the new covenant we received something which we did not work for, but which has been bequeathed to us by the Lord Jesus
Our Lord is not only the Testator, but also the Executor of the testament, or will, for 'He is Mediator of a new covenant'
We know that when writing a will it is important to have witnesses, but it is even more important to have one who can execute the will
We praise God that the Lord Jesus is not only the One who made the will, but also the One who executes the will
As far as death is concerned, the Lord Jesus is the Testator; but as far as resurrection is concerned, He is the Executor of the will
Hebrews 9:16-17 tells us that 'where there is a testament there must of necessity be the death of him who made it
When the Lord Jesus brought the blood into the Holy of Holies , He was telling God that the One who made the testament had died
Every Lord's Day we are reviewing this new covenant so that we may remember the Lord and receive all that is included in this cup
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
Concerning the matter of release from sin, Romans 6:14 says, 'For sin shall not lord it over you, for you are not under law but under grace'
If they see what the new covenant is, they will say: 'Praise God, power does not come from me; power is a bequest from the Lord to me'!
The answer is that both the ability to know God's will and the power to do God's will are bequests in the testament of the Lord Jesus
The eternal inheritance which the Lord has bequeathed to us is spiritual and cannot be exhausted in our lifetime
Today how many belonging to the Lord can say that they have been purified and that they no longer have any conscience of sins?
How many today can say that because of the Lord's anointing in us we by no means need man's teaching to know God?
We must all realize that the Lord through His blood established the new covenant and bequeathed the rich testamentthe bequestto us
We have seen in previous chapters that according to Hebrews 8:10-12 the contents of the new covenant include three major parts
Since forgiveness of sins is only a procedure by which to achieve His purpose, Scripture puts forgiveness of sins at the very end
Concerning each of our sinful acts, whether small or great, hidden or deliberate, there is a charge against us before God
The sinful acts need to be forgiven and cleansed, but we also need to be delivered and released from our sinful nature
Her weeping indicated several things her suffering because of sin the hidden story in her heart her helplessness and her hope for a Savior!
When a person commits sin which results in some incurable disease, all he can do is regret it; there is nothing more to say
With some, because they have sinned so much and so grievously, there is always the fear that God will not forgive them
Some who have been frequently troubled by their past sins and suffered overmuch have developed a weak conscience
Even though their sins have been forgiven, whenever they think of them they are still afraid, fearing they have not been forgiven
Those in such a condition with such an attitude must realize that the security of forgiveness has a firm foundation
It is not that God sees us repenting, feeling sorry, and weeping for our sins, and because of this He has pity upon us and forgives us
Those who are taught by grace realize that God's way of forgiving men their sins is perfect in both grace and righteousness
Not only is this Gods way but sometimes even His redeemed ones may express a little shadow of the perfection in both grace and righteousness
The principal then took the money from her own pocket, paid for the damage the student had done, and also forgave her of her sin
On the day the Lord of holiness bore the sins of us all, He cried loudly saying, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me'?
How unfortunate it is that what God remembers we forget, and what God does not remember we continue to keep in mind!
If God would not forgive our sins, we could speak to Him in this manner: 'O God, You have made a covenant with us
The question is, after a person has believed in the Lord and received forgiveness, does he need to be forgiven further?
There are the examples of Peters hypocrisy in Antioch Barnabas pretending with a group and the brother in Corinth who committed fornication
If we confess our sins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
God's faithfulness refers to the words which He speaks, while God's righteousness refers to the way in which He does things
Since He has said that He will cleanse us from all unrighteousness, He surely will cleanse us from all unrighteousness
If we confess our sins, we must, by taking hold of the covenant which He has made with us, expect Him to forgive and cleanse us
Others feel that if they continue to feel sorrowful and have a contrite heart, it will be easier for them to be forgiven
We must remind the reader that the confession referred to here is something we do after seeing sin in God's light
The reason we have lost so many spiritual blessings is that we have not realized that God has made a covenant with us
In the new covenant there is no need to be taught by man, for all can know God in an inward way from the least to the greatest
Whether the mind or the heart is mentioned first, both passages speak of imparting or inscribing, and both mention the mind and the heart
When we put these five matters together, the result is to 'cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my ordinances and do them
The Holy Spirit who indwells us gives us new strength to do Gods will and to please God so that God can be our God and we can be His people
Regeneration is a new thing that takes place in man's spirit; therefore regeneration is not a matter of behavior but a matter of life
The body is the seat of world-consciousness; the soul is the seat of self-consciousness; and the spirit is the seat of God-consciousness
Had man eaten of the fruit of the tree of life, he would have chosen God, for the tree of life signifies God Himself
The Lord Jesus spoke of the widow who put all her living into the treasury ; the word translated living is from the word bios
He sinned and became fallen by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil which God forbade him to eat
God told Adam from the beginning that the day he ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil he would surely die
As far as Adam's flesh was concerned, after he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, he lived for several hundred years
He has planned according to His good pleasure and He will accomplish His eternal will and fulfill His eternal purpose
Christ Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, 'that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness'
When John the Baptist came preaching and baptizing, he said, 'I baptized you in water; but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit'
John the Baptist put water and the Holy Spirit together, and the Lord Jesus also put water and the Holy Spirit together
The water to which John referred is the water of baptism hence the water to which the Lord Jesus referred must also be the water of baptism
If the water mentioned by the Lord Jesus had implied something else, it would have been difficult for Nicodemus to understand
Repentance causes man to leave all that is of himself, while believing causes man to enter into all that is of God
In John 3 the Lord Jesus spoke only once of being 'born of water,' while he mentioned being 'born of the Spirit' three times
We have been 'begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth'
When we are regenerated, we have 'authority to become children of God' , and we are related to God in life as a son to his father
It is the life which man does not have before regeneration, but which enters into us at the time of regeneration
We can understand God's heart, we spontaneously desire to do what God desires to do, and it is possible for us to live out God's image
For this reason if a man says that he is regenerated yet has no knowledge of God and no feeling concerning sin his regeneration is doubtful
For the Lord to give us a new heart does not mean that He has given us another heart, but that He has renewed our corrupted heart
With a new spirit we are not weak and impotent toward spiritual things as before, and we are no longer ignorant of the things of God
As God incarnate, Christ in the flesh could only be in the midst of men, but Christ as the Spirit can enter into men
What Christ accomplished on the cross is objective, but the Spirit indwelling us turns the objective facts into our subjective experience
We were originally an old creation, but now through the renewing of the Holy Spirit we have a new heart, a new spirit, and an uncreated life
Today, spiritually, he is in the kingdom of God; in the future, in reality, he will enter into the kingdom of God
We can praise and thank God that regeneration is so wonderful and that its results are so blessed and glorious
We still need to grow up to maturity that we may be like His kind, that is, that we may become a glorified God-man
After regeneration man needs a long process of renewal by the Holy Spirit until this life is perfected in every part of his being
From Gods Word we see that the law which can be imparted into us and inscribed upon the heart is not the law of letters but the law of life
In the old covenant there were many laws, but in the new covenant there is not the first law, the second, the third, and the last
When it tastes anything bad, you spontaneously spit it out; when it tastes anything good, you spontaneously swallow it
Suppose you say to a dead peach tree, 'You should have green leaves, you should have pink flowers, and in due time you should bear peaches'
To condemn is the function of the conscience, and we see from these verses that the conscience is within the system of the heart
Mark 2:6 speaks of reasoning in the heart; Luke 1:51 speaks of the imagination of the heart; and Luke 24:38 of the questionings of the heart
Mary kept certain sayings and pondered them in her heart , and according to Hebrews 4:12, thoughts are in the heart
The heart controls the conscience, the mind, the will, and the emotion, and is the totality of these four aspects of our being
In the spirit it has its function; in the mind it has its function; in the will it also has its function, as well as in the emotion
As far as the law itself is concerned, it is singular; but concerning the function of this law in our being, it is plural
As far as life itself is concerned there is one law, but as far as the function of its operation is concerned there are many laws
All that enters into the spirit must pass through the heart, and all that comes forth from the spirit must also pass through the heart
In other words, the fruit which man produces outwardly comes out of his heart, and for this reason the heart is the most important thing
The sorrowfulness of the heart is the specific function of the conscience, and being repentant is the turning of the mind
We must remember that the receiving of life begins with our heart and that the growth of this life also begins with our heart
We must realize that the heart has desires and inclinations, while the spirit enables us to have fellowship and communion with God
Some would say that if we wish to touch the things of God we need to use our mind, just as when we hear sounds we need to use our mind
While it is true that to hear sounds we must use our mind, it is also true that to hear sounds we must use our ears
The sounds are transmitted to your mind through your ears, and the colors are transmitted to your mind through the eyes
If God wants to have fellowship and communion with us, yet we do not have a heart, it is impossible for Him to do so
God's life has been imparted into our spirit, but this life desires to spread out and move into the different parts of our inward being
Even if our intuition is strong and our brain is healthy, if the mind has a problem, the meaning within us cannot be made known
The word 'understanding' in verse 18, which in Greek is dianoia, defines the function of this organ and can be likened to our seeing
From this example, we see that whether it be a person, a matter, or a thing, it can all become an imagination to occupy our mind
When a man's mind is occupied by some imagination, his understanding becomes darkened and the power to understand becomes weakened
In summary we can say that when the heart is hardened we become estranged from the life of God we become ignorant and unable to understand
The result of putting these five things together is that we might walk in God's statutes and keep His ordinances
We have already pointed out that God has given us a new heart with a new spirit and that the Holy Spirit dwells within us
We must realize that when we speak of a stony heart and a fleshly heart, it does not mean that we have two hearts
A stony heart refers to the hardness of the heart, while the fleshly heart refers to the softness of the heart; but the heart is still one
Our stony heart must be gradually transformed into a fleshly heart so that God's life can move out with no hindrance
At the time of their salvation their heart was softened perhaps seventy percent, but after a while their heart becomes hardened again
Perhaps the heart is caught by certain things, touched by a certain person, entangled by some object, or attracted by a certain job
If our heart is caught by things other than God whether it is some thing some person or some matter it will always hinder the moving of life
When God's life desires to move out within us, He always touches our heart first, causing our stony heart to be softened
By such a work God is transforming a stony heart into a fleshly heart so that His life can move without any hindrance
If you are willing to obey God, His life will move out into your conscience, into your mind, into your will, and into your emotions
He only knew that God wanted him to leave his home, his land, and his kindred and go into a place which God would show him
After obeying in the first step, you still need to continue to look to God, committing the second step to God through fellowship
Mark 1230 says Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength
The verse shows that we have to use our whole heart, our whole soul, our whole understanding, and our whole strength to love God
The experience of many saints indicates that God first plants life into us, then touches our emotion with love
It also says, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
Brothers and sisters, what God expects of us today is that our heart, our soul, our understanding, and our strength be touched by Him
If our heart is turned to God, we will have enlightenment within us, and we will hear His voice and have the sense of life within
If we want to know Gods will we should not attempt to understand with our mind we should first turn our heart to God
The cross simply means that when our heart is touched by God we offer ourselves to Him so that His life can continue to move within us
The death of Christ and the life of Christ thus cause us to be delivered from sin and from all that God hates and condemns
On the other hand, they cause us to receive something fresh, something illuminating, something of joy and peace
The reason the new covenant is a better covenant is because through it the law is imparted into man; it is inscribed on man's heart
It is also the power of the moving of this life which is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think
The Scripture says that man's 'heart is in the hand of Jehovah as the watercourses: He turneth it whithersoever He will'
The answer follows: 'For it is God Who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
The conscience of a certain sister was so accused that she felt she would never want God's will and never be able to obey God again
Ephesians 2:10 says, 'We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them'
It is through the power of this life that the masterpiece can be accomplished and that we can do the good works which He has prepared for us
In other words, what God was operating inwardly was an exploding power; hence, what Paul was working outwardly was also an exploding power
The Apostle Paul worked, not because he was energetic in himself, but because within him there was an exploding power
These three passages of Scripture show that there is a great difference between the service of the new covenant and that of the old
In other words, the service in the old covenant was according to the written letter, commandment after commandment
Service which is according to 'the letter' is old, but service which is the result of living 'in Christ' is fresh
Service which is according to 'the letter' is only in letters, but service which comes from living 'in Christ' is spiritual
We can say then that any kind of service which is outward, according to the letter, and in oldness, is the service of the old covenant
The service of the new covenant is something which is the result of having a relationship with Christ and is worked out from within
The strength of service is of Him, the course of service is through Him, and the result of service is unto Him
When the law of life is allowed to move in us without hindrance, it will develop to a state where Christ can be formed in us
To the extent that God's life becomes mingled with us, Christ will be formed in us, and to that extent we will be transformed
If during the first days of incubation you use a light to look through the egg, you cannot tell which part is the head and which is the foot
It is when the chicken is almost ready to break through the shell and come out that you can see what the complete shape of the chicken is
How many who serve the Lord care for the spiritual state of God's children and labor painfully in spiritual birth?
Objectively speaking, Christians have already put off, as regards their former manner of life, the old man, and have also put on the new man
At the same time we need to believe Philippians 213 For it is God Who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure
Conformation spoken of in Romans 8:29 and Philippians 3:10 means in the original text to be of like form and nature or to be alike
When 2 Corinthians 3:12-16 is examined carefully, it is apparent that the veil was due to the fact that the heart did not want the Lord
When Moses came into the presence of God he removed the veil, but when he came out he used the veil to cover his face again
The veil upon Moses' face speaks of the condition of the children of Israel, that their hearts were far from God
The veil upon their heart had not yet been removed: therefore, when they read the Old Testament they could not understand it
Whenever we feel that there is a barrier, a veil, between the Lord and us, our heart needs to be turned once again to the Lord
We have seen that when Adam fell the spirit died first, and man became completely controlled by the soul and completely in the flesh
Through the work of the cross the Holy Spirit puts to death the evil practices of our body , causing us to deny ourselves daily
From these verses we see that God's salvation begins with making our spirit alive and ends with the redemption of our body
To be clean means to be without defilement, but purifying means not only to be without defilement, but also to be without mixture
In Genesis 2 we see that after God had created man, He indicated that man should exercise his free will to choose His life
In the books of Ezekiel and Isaiah we are clearly told of the cherub which God had made, who later exalted himself to become equal with God
One day our Lord taught His disciples to pray, 'Our Father Who is in the heavens, let Your name be sanctified'
When the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us , this Word of life which was from the beginning was heard and seen and touched by man
No one has ever seen God'; but now 'the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
Although in the old covenant time the people of Israel forsook God, in the future God will make a new covenant with them
In the future He will impart His laws into their minds and inscribe them upon their hearts so that He may be their God
Anyone who knows God as God in all things cannot but fear Him and pay attention to such things as his clothing and behavior
Anyone who is loose, careless, haughty, doing whatever he will, and allowing sin to remain, is one who does not know God as God
If man does not deal seriously with all the sins which should be dealt with, he will fall, one day, into the hands of the living God
The fall infected us with the desire to be God, but salvation once again instills in us the willing desire to be man
When eventually they come to the wedding feast of the Lamb, they will still bow down and worship God, who sits upon the throne
He who is able to do signs and deceive people upon the earth, telling them to worship the beast is surely the false Christ
Rather it says that God wants to be our God in the law of life and that He wants us to be His people in the law of life
Due to God's redemption, when man repents and believes, not only does his spirit become alive, but he also receives God's uncreated life
Through the Holy Spirit, God enters into us and dwells in us, and from that point on we can worship God in spirit and in reality
Verse 23 says, 'The true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him'
When we read this with what follows, we see that if a man desires to worship God, he must first know how to worship the Father
When a person is born again, his spirit is made alive, he becomes a child of God, and he can have fellowship with God
For this reason we say that God becomes our God in the law of life, and we are God's people in the law of life
The reason we can become God's peculiar people is because He is our God in the law of life, and we are His people in the law of life
The characteristic of the new covenant is that man may know God Himself in the law of life, and in this way fulfill God's purpose
To properly understand the teaching of the anointing we need to consider the three functions of the human spirit
We have said previously that man's spirit is composed of three parts or functions: intuition, fellowship, and conscience
We also know that God is Spirit, and that for this reason he who worships Him must worship in spirit and in reality
1 Corinthians 16:18 says, 'they refreshed my spirit,' and 2 Corinthians 7:13 says, 'his spirit hath been refreshed'
If it is something which should cause rejoicing, we rejoice; if it is something which should cause sorrow, we feel sorrowful
For some unknown reason there is an unexplainable feeling within us which seems to be very heavy and very depressed
It seems that something inside us is opposing what we are thinking in our mind, feeling in our emotion, or have decided in our will
At the same time, for a reason unknown to us, there is a certain kind of urging, moving, and encouraging, wanting us to do it
We know a certain thing through the intuition of the spirit; then the mind is enlightened to understand what the intuition knows
For this reason, if we want to do God's will, it is not necessary to ask others, nor is it necessary to ask ourselves
Later they asked a minister of the Word this question, 'After a man is saved, should he drink Timothian wine'?
The minister replied that he had worked for over ten years and had never heard of anything called Timothian wine
Although at that time the servant of God did not say so with his mouth, he said in his heart, 'Why do you need to take the roundabout way?
With some it may be more, with others less, but at least we all have some experience that there is this law of life within us
What this man was preaching was not in accordance with the Scripture, for he did not confess that Jesus Christ had come in the flesh
We are so weak that even though God has spoken once, twice, five times, ten times, or even twenty times, we still have not heard
Many times the problem is not that God has not spoken or that man does not have the speaking within, but that man refuses to hear
Whenever we do not hear God's voice and do not have the teaching of the anointing, we need to realize that something must be wrong with us
The Scriptures do not speak in place of the anointing within, but simply repeat what the anointing has already said
All of us who belong to God must learn to receive the teaching of the anointing within, otherwise it is not the new covenant
Romans 122 shows us that first the mind must be renewed and transformed then we can prove what is Gods good wellpleasing and perfect will
Colossians 1:9 shows us that we must first have the spiritual understanding; then we will be filled with the full knowledge of God's will
On the other hand, having merely the inner sense may be living, but not accurate; or it may be living, but not secure
On the other hand if there is only power within the locomotive but no rails without the train will run without control and have an accident
The ordinary knowledge is the objective, outward knowledge, while the intuitive knowledge is the subjective, inward knowledge
Although we may use our eyes to know the sugar and the salt from without, it is not as accurate as tasting them with our tongue
Thank God that the characteristic of the new covenant not only enables us to taste spiritual things; it even enables us to taste God Himself
If we read these last two verses of Scripture together, we can see that our knowing God can be divided into three steps
The first step is to know God's doings; the second step is to know God's ways; and the third step is to know God Himself
To know God's doings and ways are only outward knowing, but the inward knowing of God's nature and knowing God Himself is the deeper knowing
Today some people have been healed of their illness by God, or have been protected by God from danger on a journey
We see that the reason they could do this, and do it so spontaneously, was because they did it according to God's nature
Otherwise, if they did it only in an outward way, inwardly they would still have the feeling they were being wronged
John 17:3 says: 'And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him Whom You have sent, Jesus Christ'
In other words, when a man receives eternal life he receives a knowing of God in the intuition which he did not possess before
If someone says that he has eternal life and yet has never known God then his claim to have eternal life is doubtfulit is only in the letter
Corinthians 2:11-12 says, 'For who among men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man, which is in him?
We received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is from God that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God
The things of God cannot be known by mans mind man cannot figure them out by his own thoughts nor can he comprehend them by his own wisdom
The spirit of revelation means that God moves in our spirit and enables our intuition to know the intent of God and to know God's movement
The first one is the knowing of the intuition, while the second is the knowing or the understanding of the mind
If in all things we seek God's will in our spirit, the result will be that more and more we will know God Himself
Whenever we feel blurry inside, the most important thing to do is to ask God to show us whether or not our heart is pure
The Lord Jesus said If anyone loves Me he will keep My word and My Father will love him and We will come to him and make an abode with him
The saints of old wrote in the Psalms: 'As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God'
The Apostle John said, 'And every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the spirit of the antichrist,
Ye are of God, my little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world'
Those who truly know God can discern the false apostles , the false prophets , the false brethren , and the false angels of light
Those who truly know God have the boldness to declare, 'Greater is He who dwells in us than the spirit of antichrist'!
One who truly knows God, not only has the boldness to testify, and is not afraid of the spirit of antichrist, but he especially fears God
Another example of his fear of God is given in Acts 23:3-5, when being reminded that he rebuked the high priest, he became softened
We fear for him because the day will come when he will see God's face, though today he does not know God in his consciousness
In the future, when everything shall be opened before the Lord, will there be anything which will cause us to be ashamed?
Brother Lawrence said, 'To worship God in truth is to acknowledge Him to be what He is, and ourselves as what in very fact we are
That man is little guided by reason, who does not employ all his powers to render to this great God the worship that is His due'
When we were regenerated, God, according to His divine power, gave to us all things that pertain to life and godliness
The Apostle Paul said: 'We have set our hope on the living God, Who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe'
Within us we already have the godly life of God, but to manifest the nature of this life, we need to exercise ourselves unto godliness
To exercise ourselves unto godliness, on the negative side, means to deny all ungodliness , things which do not conform to God
We also need to realize that there is one thing which is unavoidable to all that would live godly in Christ Jesus
For this reason a believer once said The most spiritual believers are seamed with scars martyrs have put on their crown glittering with fire
We need not be fearful, for either the Lord will empower us, making us able to endure, or He will deliver us from all the sufferings
Also we need to mention that exercising unto godliness, or living godly in Christ Jesus, is a spiritual pursuit and an overflow of life
Either she would have the excuse of not knowing how to do it or she would have the excuse of not having the strength to do it
At one point someone arranged for her to pick some flowers from the garden every day and arrange them in a vase
One brother met a certain one who whenever he would say a few words would bow down his head or raise up his head to look up into the heavens
Let us not think that such a self-assumed godliness and such a cold, hardhearted attitude will ever attract others to long after God
Those who practice godliness and become passive also cannot understand what others say, nor show any concern for the affairs of others
If this were normal, then how could Brother Lawrence handle the affairs in the midst of the noise and clatter of his busy environment?
Brothers and sisters, our Lord is the Word who became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality
Blessed Redeemer; This is my constant longing and prayer; Gladly I'll forfeit all of earth's treasures, Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear
Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art; Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness; Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart
Full of compassion, Loving, forgiving, tender and kind, Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting, Seeking the wand'ring sinners to find
Lowly in spirit, Holy and harmless, patient and brave; Meekly enduring cruel reproaches, Willing to suffer, others to save
To know God is the purpose, so it is mentioned first; but the forgiveness of sins is the procedure, so it is mentioned later
In verse 5, we are told that God 'predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself,' because this is the purpose
Later, in verse 7, it is mentioned that 'we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses,' because this is the procedure
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer'
If a person has life he will seek fellowship; when there is fellowship he will see light; and when he sees light he will seek the blood
Light prompts us to seek the cleansing of the blood, and the cleansing of the blood allows us to see the light more clearly
As a car moves by the continuous turning of the wheels, so the experience of these four matters is just like the turning of the wheels
The faith within can prove the unseen things to us, so that our heart can say 'amen' to the words which God has spoken
Faith is the foundation or supporting ground which holds the things we hoped for; faith is the proof of things unseen
He has bequeathed to us the entire spiritual inheritance, and He is also the Executor of the testament, or will
Since the Lord has created the initial faith in us , we believe that He will also bring this faith to perfection
In closing, let us exercise our heart to read two passages of Scripture and so express our deep longing and our heart's desire
