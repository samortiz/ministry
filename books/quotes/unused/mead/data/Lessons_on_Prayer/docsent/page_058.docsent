   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TERMINATION OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One who knows how to pray and can pray is always one who has been both redeemed under the blood and terminated on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In going before God to pray, first you need to ask whether or not you have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose you wish to pray concerning the gospel, your family, the giving of material things, or about the matter of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In each case, you need to ask if you have been terminated in that particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must ask whether you are praying with any self-interest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever you pray for, you need to have a termination in that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Always keep in mind that the fire that burns on the offering altar is the same fire that burns incense on the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only the fire that burns the sacrifice into ashes can be the fire that burns the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If, without having burned the sacrifice into ashes, the fire is brought to the incense altar to burn the incense, that is called strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You can realize the seriousness of this matter by the fate of Nadab and Abihu.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you have not been terminated in a certain matter, yet you bring that matter into the presence of God in prayer, it is a great offense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Strictly speaking, if one has not been terminated by the cross in a certain matter, it is really not possible for him to pray for that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you have not been terminated by the cross concerning your husband or wife, then, frankly speaking, you are not qualified to pray for your husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why is it that many times the Lord does not hear our prayers for our own families?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The answer is that we have not become ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those prayers were merely natural prayers, prayers of strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times when we pray for the church of God and for the work of the Lord, the Lord does not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You pray for the Lord's blessings, yet you do not see the blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have been praying for years, asking the Lord to make the church grow, but the church still has no growth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Your prayers have not been answered because they are prayers of strange fire, natural prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We always have the concept that God will surely hear our prayers because He is merciful and gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This concept is erroneous.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God often does not hear men's prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason He does not hear is that we, the praying ones, have not passed through the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some bring with them only the blood of the altar, but not the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They pass through the redemption, but not through the termination of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please remember, whenever man goes to burn incense at the incense altar, he must fulfill two basic conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He must experience the blood which tells us that all those who come there to pray have been redeemed and cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He must also experience the fire which tells us that all those who come there to pray have been consumed and have become ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, brothers and sisters, if the light of the Lord shines on you strongly, immediately you will not be able to pray for a great number of things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The decrease in the number of your prayers proves that you are being purified.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you recognize that many prayers are prayers of strange fire, you will see that those prayers are neither necessary nor right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You will not dare pray those prayers which are for yourself and not for God's sake because they are initiated by you, not by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After you have been terminated by the cross there is a great purification of your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some may ask, "As we have thus been terminated, why do we need to even consider praying?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since we have become ashes that neither speak nor think, everything has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What more, then, do we need to pray about?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ashes do mean that everything has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not forget, however, that the fire that burns the ashes is still there to burn the incense before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we studied the Old Testament types we became clear that the incense refers to the Lord's resurrection and the fragrance of the Lord in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Where the Lord is, there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wherever you and I have been terminated, there is the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We first pass through the redemption of the cross before God, accept the termination of the cross, and truly become ashes before God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then, immediately, Christ becomes the incense which we burn before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Strictly speaking, therefore, prayer is both Christ Himself and the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A prayer that is good, right, proper, true, and acceptable to God is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are terminated on the cross, Christ will live out of such a termination.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the case of prayer, Christ is lived out in the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the case of living, the resurrected Christ is the living.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the ministry, the resurrected Christ is the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only such a prayer can be acceptable before God and be considered a prayer of sweet-smelling savor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a prayer of one who has passed through the cleansing of the blood and the termination of the fire, thus allowing Christ to come forth from within.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, brothers, if you really have a vision of this, you will prostrate yourself before God, confessing your filthiness and your naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You will not be able initially to utter any other prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You will see the need to be cleansed by the blood and consumed by the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You will say to God, "I am an unclean person, and I am also a natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To this day I am still in my natural self.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I need Your blood to cleanse me and Your fire to consume me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I need the cross to redeem and also to terminate me."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brothers, when you thus allow the cross to terminate you, you can, in a practical way, experience Christ coming forth from you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is this resurrected Christ Who becomes your prayer, the incense which you burn before God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may not pray many prayers, but those that you do pray will be answered by God.</S>
