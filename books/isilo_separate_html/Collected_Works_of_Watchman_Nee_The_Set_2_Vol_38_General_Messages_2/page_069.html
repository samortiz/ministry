One of the changes should be in his temper. Some people have believed in the Lord for many years, yet their temper is still the same as it was before they were saved. This is very unfortunate, and it surely does not glorify the Lord. As soon as a man believes in the Lord, he should take care of the problem of his temper. It is wrong for a person to have a terrible temper for years without seeing any change at all.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPRESSIONS OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>There are some clear expressions of the Christian life that should be exhibited as soon as a person is saved.</p><p>In John 15:12 the Lord charged the disciples to love one another. One expression of the Christian life is love. We have to love. We should love our brothers, and we should love all men.</p><p>The Lord also said, "Blessed are the meek" (Matt. 5:5). A Christian should have a meek attitude; he should not be stubborn. We should learn to have a meek attitude. "Behold, your King is coming to you, meek and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden" (21:5). The Lord was meek in His attitude; He came meek and mounted on a donkey.</p><p>Luke 9:23 says, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself...and follow Me." The Christian life is a life of denying the self. The Christian life should not be one that speaks for itself, fights for itself, or builds itself up; rather, it should be one that denies itself.</p><p>First Corinthians 13:7 says that love "endures all things." The Christian life should not be one of impatience, but one of endurance.</p><p>First Thessalonians 5:16 says, "Always rejoice." The Christian life should be one that always rejoices. Nothing should disturb our joy or quench our rejoicing.</p><p>Philippians 4:7 says, "And the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus." A Christian should not allow anything to disturb or usurp his peace. God's children should maintain their peace at all times.</p><p>Matthew 11:29 is also a very important verse. It is the Lord's own word: "I am meek and lowly in heart." A Christian should be lowly in heart. He should not be arrogant; rather, he should humble himself all the time.</p><h2 class="head1">TEMPER BEING INCOMPATIBLE<br />WITH THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2><p>Love, meekness, self-denial, joy, peace, and humility are all proper expressions of the Christian life. Temper and anger are not compatible with these expressions.</p><p>Where there is love, there is no anger. Where love flourishes, anger does not exist. Where love is, temper does not exist. One cannot be loving and angry at the same time. The Lord's command is that a Christian should love others, whether they are unbelievers or believers. If love fills your heart, anger will depart. It is impossible to love a person and be angry with him at the same time. You must realize how important love is for a child of God. Love should not be in just your conduct; it must become your attitude as well. You should not love occasionally; rather, love has to be your attitude. If you have such an attitude, it will be impossible for you to lose your temper.</p><p>The Lord commands us to be meek, and He was very meek when He was on earth. He came on a donkey, which means that He does not reign with severity but in meekness. When the Lord was on earth, it was easy for men to talk to Him, invite Him, and approach Him. It is hard to talk with some people, but a Christian should be anything but unapproachable. It should not be a hard thing to approach him. A Christian should be meek. If we are meek in our attitude and nature, spontaneously we will not lose our temper easily. Temper makes a person hard; those who have a temper are crude in their emotion. Love and compassion are the finest of all human affections, while anger is the crudest. If a man is meek in the eyes of the Lord, he will not give any ground to anger. It is an expression of crudeness for one to constantly argue and lose his temper. This is not compatible with meekness.</p><p>The Lord charges us to deny ourselves and to learn to be self-denying. If a man denies himself and drops his rights, he will not get angry easily. Men become angry when they want to fight for themselves. If a man does not fight for himself, he will not need to lose his temper. Brothers and sisters, as children of God we should deny ourselves and not protect ourselves.</p><p>Sometimes others are unreasonable with us. Many things tend to provoke us, but the Bible says that love is not provoked (1 Cor. 13:5). The Lord shows us that we should be patient. Whatever the Lord allows to happen to us, we should be patient. The Lord's command is that a Christian's life be a life of patience. If we live a patient life, there will be no possibility of losing our temper.</p><p>A Christian should always rejoice. Joy is life. A man cannot be angry and rejoicing at the same time; this is impossible. Either you are rejoicing or you are angry. When you are angry, you cannot possibly be rejoicing. A man cannot be happy and angry at the same time. If the Lord's joy fills your heart, there will be no place in your life left for anger. The Lord has not given you ground for your anger. Brothers and sisters, if your life is filled with joy, your bad temper will be gone spontaneously.</p><p>The Lord intends that we be filled with peace. Nothing should disturb our peace. We should be at peace in the midst of everything, no matter what the circumstance. The Lord's peace guards our minds and hearts from all attacks. If our hearts are filled with this peace, it will be impossible for us to become angry.</p><p>A child of God should be one who humbles himself. God does not want us to be high-minded; He does not want us to sit in a high place. God's Son humbled Himself when He was on earth. He desires that we would also be lowly and that we would go along with the lowly (Rom. 12:16). Temper is incompatible with humility. We have to follow and learn of our lowly Lord who took a lowly way.</p><p>In Matthew 5:22 the Lord said, "But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment." The Lord is not pleased to see any of His own becoming angry or losing their temper easily. It is especially bad to get angry or lose our temper with our brothers. Every child of God should learn to control his temper and not become angry easily.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
