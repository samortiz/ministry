<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. To Be Our High Priest<br>in God's New Testament Economy</H2><P>Christ is our High Priest in God's New Testament economy to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs (Heb. 4:14; 7:26; 9:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. To Be the Mediator of the New Covenant</H2><P>In His ascension Christ has become the Mediator, the Executor, of the new covenant, the new testament, which He bequeathed to us by His death (Heb. 8:6; 9:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. To Be the Surety of the Better Covenant</H2><P>Christ is also the surety, the pledge that everything in the new covenant will be fulfilled (Heb. 7:22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. To Be the Minister<br>in the Heavenly Holy of Holies</H2><P>Christ is the Minister in the heavenly Holy of Holies to minister heaven (which is not only a place but also a condition of life) into us that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth, as He did when He was here (Heb. 8:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. To Be the Paraclete (Advocate)<br>of the New Testament Believers</H2><P>In His ascension Christ is the Paraclete (Advocate) of the New Testament believers (1 John 2:1; John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. To Be the New Testament Believers'<br>Intercessor at the Right Hand of God<br>and within Them As Well</H2><P>Christ is the New Testament believers' Intercessor at the right hand of God and within them as well (Rom. 8:34, 26).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. ALL THESE EXCELLENT, DIVINE, AND HUMAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS BEING FOR THE PRODUCING AND BUILDING UP OF THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>All these excellent, divine, and human accomplishments are for the producing and building up of the organic Body of Christ as the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as the expansion and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in humanity for eternity (Eph. 1:23; 4:12, 16; Rev. 21:1&#151;22:5).</P><P>The outline and the fellowship in this chapter are worthy of our study. We need to get into the accomplishments of the Triune God from His incarnation through His human living, His death, and His resurrection to His ascension. The accomplishments of the processed and consummated Triune God are the real content of the Bible. They are for the purpose of making God man so that the many men chosen by God can be made God in His life and in His nature but not in His Godhead, so that God and man can be constituted together as one entity. This one entity is the organic Body of Christ consummating in the New Jerusalem.</P>
