   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Both the Old and New Covenants</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Espousal Covenants</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that both the Old and New Covenants were espousal covenants, covenants of engagement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Entire Old Testament Spoken in This Way</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a whole, the Old Testament was spoken in the way of a covenant of engagement.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the reason that Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea all refer to God s people as His wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though His people wanted to divorce Him, the Lord would bring them back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He would betroth them to Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider how the word betroth is used in Hosea 2:19 and 20: And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know Jehovah Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In these verses the Lord uses the word betroth three times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The future tense indicates that this refers to the second betrothal of God s people to Him, the betrothal in which the divorced wife is brought back to the Lord as her Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the Old Covenant was a matter of espousal, of engagement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Law Given in This Way</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we have indicated, the law was given in the way of an engagement paper, of an engagement contract.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When God gave the law to His people on the mountain, He was betrothing them to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In giving them the law, He was seeking to stir them up to love Him and not to have any other beloved in addition to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Entire New Testament Written in This Way</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The entire New Testament was written in the way of romance and courtship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Gospel of Matthew speaks of Christ as a Bridegroom, and the book of Revelation refers to the marriage of the Lamb and concludes with a revelation of the New Jerusalem as the Lamb s wife.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, in 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul expresses the same concept when he says, For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see that Paul realized that he had espoused the church to Christ, her Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then in Ephesians Paul refers to Christ s love for the church, charging husbands to love their wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her Eph 5:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the whole New Testament was written in an atmosphere of romance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord is the One courting us, and we are His love, His spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, at the end of the New Testament, we have the marriage of Christ and His people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Entire Bible Being God s Courting Word</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The entire Bible is God s courting word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Bible we see that God is seeking our love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord asked Peter if he loved Him, He was courting Peter, seeking his affectionate love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a whole, the Bible is a word of such divine courtship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Responsive, Affectionate Love Needed</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>to Keep the Courting Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we would keep God s courting word, we need a responsive, affectionate love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter was asked to love the Lord in this way, and Paul was constrained to love the Lord with such a love 2 Cor 5:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All believers need to love the Lord in this way John 14:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we have seen, this kind of responsive, affectionate love is depicted in Song of Songs, where we have a portrait of the love between the Beloved and His love S. S. 1:2-4 .</S>
