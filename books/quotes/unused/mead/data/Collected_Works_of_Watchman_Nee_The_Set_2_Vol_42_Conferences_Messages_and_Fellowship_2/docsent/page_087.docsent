   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COMING TO GOD JUST AS WE ARE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A brother once asked, "If I let go today, but cannot let go tomorrow, what will happen to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I said, "You can go to the Lord and say, Lord, I cannot let go, and I will not try to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank You that You can make me let go!'</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you find that you cannot believe, you can say to the Lord, I cannot believe, and I will not try to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank You that You can believe for me.'"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is not a single weakness in us that is so severe that it can frustrate God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We only need to come to the Lord just as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From now on there is nothing that is impossible with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we pass the gate of victory, day by day we will find the Lord overcoming the sins that we could not otherwise overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Another brother once asked, "Does this mean that if I let go and believe today, that I will never sin again?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No. You can still sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But there is a big difference between letting go and believing, and not letting go and not believing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before one can experience the overcoming life, failure is the rule while victory is the exception.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But after one passes the gate of victory, victory is the rule while failure is the exception.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Victory is the normal experience, while failure is the abnormal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The old sins are gone and his tone has changed; everything is different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is no longer bound by the sins that once beset him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a big difference between his present state and his former condition when he had not yet experienced the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE WAY TO DEAL WITH TEMPTATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are living the overcoming life may still encounter temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When temptations come, how should we deal with them?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are two kinds of temptation that Christians encounter in their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first kind of temptation comes slowly; it gives a person time to think about it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second kind of temptation comes suddenly; it does not give a person time to think about it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These two temptations vary in the duration of time, and the way to deal with them is different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us consider the way to deal with these two kinds of temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Dealing with Temptations That Come Slowly</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way to deal with the first kind of temptation is similar to the way one gets through the gate of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When this kind of temptation comes, he should not "stick out his head"; rather, he should hide behind the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He should not resist or fight the temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He only needs to tell God directly, "I know I like to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I will not try to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lord, I thank You and praise You because You can be my patience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I cannot overcome this temptation myself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just as Your blood saved me, Your flesh, that is, Your life, will also save me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If he stands firm in this position, the temptation will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he struggles with the temptation and tries to resist, it will never leave him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when he says, "I cannot make it, but God can make it," and when he boasts in his weakness and in God's strength, the temptation will go away immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Dealing with Temptations That Come Suddenly</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to deal with the second kind of temptation, we must first realize that sudden sins, temptations, and snares are like fiery darts that come upon us; they shoot us when we least expect it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The way to deal with these sudden, fiery darts is to lift up our faith as a shield.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people use faith like "pliers."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When fiery darts hit them, they try to pull them out with "faith-pliers."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But this is futile.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is a shield?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A shield is something that is between the enemy's darts and us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every morning we have to pray with faith and ask God to deliver us from temptations so that we will not encounter unexpected temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, during the whole day, we have to believe that Christ will live His life out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to believe that just as we sinned without effort or resolutions when we were in Adam and joined to him, we can live out the patience of Christ and express His holiness without effort or resolutions now that we are in Christ and are joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every morning when we wake up, we have to believe that God will deliver us from temptations that we do not even have a chance to think about.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We also have to believe that Christ's life will manifest His victory through us without any conscious effort on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a man says that he cannot guarantee that he will not fail today, he will surely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If he says, "I believe that I will surely overcome today," he will still fail.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But suppose he says, "Lord, I thank You because You have said that Your grace is sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lord, I am weak and will always be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I do not have any strength, and I cannot overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But You have said that Your grace is sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I commit myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I believe in You, and I believe that Your grace is sufficient."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He has the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When he believes in the Lord's Word and stands on His Word, he will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must have the shield of faith with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord's prayer to the Father in Matthew 6 is a very good prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He prayed that the Father would not bring us into temptation v. 13 . We also have to pray like the Lord, saying, "Lord, do not bring me into the sudden temptations." If we do this, we will see the Lord's deliverance.</S>
