 <h2 class="head3">Subject Ten</h2>
<h1 class="title">&ldquo;WHERE ARE YOU?&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
IN A LOST CONDITION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 3:9; Luke 19:10; 15:3-10<br />
<em>Subjects 10 through 16 form a group defining the position of fallen man. They are entitled &ldquo;Where Are You?&rdquo; (Gen. 3:9).</em></h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Where did man come from?<br />
<span class="normal">The source of man is touched in order to bring in God, and to let men see that man came from God.</span></li>
<li>Who does man belong to?<br />
<span class="normal">Everything has an owner, and man is an important item. Then who is the owner of man? Who is your owner? From here, point out the fact that man is in a lost condition, because he looks all around and cannot find his master. Only lost articles are unable to find their owners.</span></li>
<li>Man is in a lost condition<br />
<span class="normal">The fact that man cannot find his owner proves that man is in a lost condition. Man cannot tell where he came from nor where he is going. He is like a ship which has lost its direction. Man is busy all day, but he doesn&rsquo;t know what he is busy for. Man is always in a hurry, but he doesn&rsquo;t know where he is hurrying to go. Is not this a lost condition? Use some real stories to describe how men went astray and got lost.</span></li>
<li>God came to seek man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus was God come in the flesh.</li>
	<li>He is the Shepherd coming to find the lost sheep.</li>
	<li>He is seeking for man through the Holy Spirit. (See Luke 15:8, the woman seeking for the lost money.)</li>
	<li>The Holy Spirit moves in man through the word of the Bible. (The woman lighted a lamp.)</li>
	<li>When the Holy Spirit enlightens you, you feel troubled inside. This feeling comes from the Lord Jesus enlightening you through the Holy Spirit. (The woman swept the house.) Some who are here listening to the gospel do have this troubled feeling inside because the Holy Spirit is sweeping inside of you, the Lord Jesus is seeking for you. At this point, ask anyone who has such a feeling to please stand up.</li>
	</ol></li>
