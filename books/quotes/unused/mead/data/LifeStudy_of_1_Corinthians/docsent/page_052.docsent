   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOULISH MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 14 says, But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 13 stresses the spiritual means, that is, the spiritual words by which the spiritual things are spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 14 and 15 stress the spiritual object, that is, a spiritual man, not a soulish one, who is able to discern the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both the means and the object need to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spiritual things must be spoken by the spiritual words to the spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A soulish man is a natural man, one living in his soul, not in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, he rejects them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The religious Jews who required signs and the philosophical Greeks who sought wisdom 1:22 were such natural men, to whom the things of the Spirit of God were foolishness 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The things of the Spirit of God in verse 14 refer to the deep things of God concerning Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A soulish man cannot know these things, for he does not have the constitutional capacity for spiritual perception.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, he is not able to know spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Spiritual things are spiritually discerned, examined, and investigated by spiritual persons with spiritual means.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the context of 1 Corinthians, a soulish man is one who lives according to Greek culture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In principle, those who live according to their culture are soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a Chinese believer lives according to Chinese ethics, he is soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, if an American brother lives according to modern American culture, he also is a soulish man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, a soulish man is a person who lives in his culture.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>SPIRITUAL DISCERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verse 14 Paul emphasizes the fact that the things of the Spirit of God are spiritually discerned.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would discern spiritual things, we must know that we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we need to realize that the Spirit of God dwells in our spirit and go on to exercise our spirit to discern spiritual things in a spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 15 Paul says, But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he is discerned by no one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be spiritual is to move, act, and live in our spirit by the Spirit of God, who dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who do not exercise the spirit have no way to discern a spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as a cow has no appreciation of good music, so a soulish person cannot discern a spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today many Christians can be compared to cows listening to music: they have no appreciation or discernment of what they hear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These Christians can readily understand worldly things or natural things, but they are not able to discern spiritual things or spiritual people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE MIND OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 16 is a conclusion to this portion of 1 Corinthians: For who has known the mind of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who will instruct Him?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But we have the mind of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we are organically one with Christ, we have all the faculties He has.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The mind is the intelligence faculty, the understanding organ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have such an organ of Christ so we can know what He knows.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have not only the life of Christ but also His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ must saturate our mind from our spirit, making our mind one with His.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we are one with Christ, His mind becomes our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This should not merely be a doctrine to us; it must be both our experience and our practice.</S>
