   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Realizing That Jehovah Their God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Is God, the Faithful God, Who Keeps</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Covenant and Lovingkindness with Those</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who Love Him and Keep His Commandments</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 7:9-15 Moses wanted the people to realize that Jehovah their God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and lovingkindness to the thousandth generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments; that He would love them, bless them, and multiply them; that He would bless the fruit of their womb and the fruit of their ground, their grain, their new wine, their fresh oil, the offspring of their cattle, and the young of their flock; and that He would remove every sickness and those evil illnesses of Egypt from them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today God loves us, blesses us, and multiplies us because we keep His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is in Christ that we receive and enjoy God's blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is with us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's grace and peace are to us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we need to be right with God by taking Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The unique commandment God gives to the world today is to believe in His Son and to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, Christ Himself is the commandment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to receive Him, keep Him, and be right with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do this, we will be right with God, and He will love us and bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>H. Not Being Afraid of the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>but Remembering That Which Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their God Did to Pharaoh and to All Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moses told the children of Israel not to be afraid of the nations but to remember that which Jehovah their God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt by the great trials, by the signs and the wonders, and by His mighty hand and His outstretched arm vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 20 Moses went on to say, "Furthermore, Jehovah your God will send the hornet among them until those who are left and those who hide themselves from you are destroyed."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Something like this happened in 1948 when Israel was restored as a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time God used hornets to fight on behalf of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 16 Moses said, "You shall devour all the peoples which Jehovah your God is giving to you; your eye shall not pity them."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then in verse 22 Moses explained, "Jehovah your God will clear away these nations from before you little by little; you shall not devour all of them immediately, lest the beasts of the field multiply against you."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The children of Israel were not great in number.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If all the Canaanites were slain immediately, the beasts of the field would multiply against God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, the Canaanites, who were useful in keeping the beasts from multiplying, were to be cleared away little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moses also charged the people to burn with fire the idols of the nations' gods, not desiring the silver or gold upon the idols, nor taking it for themselves, lest they be ensnared by it v. 25 . Likewise, they were not to bring an abomination into their house, lest they become a cursed thing like it v. 26 . This indicates how concerned Moses, an aged father, was for his beloved children.</S>
