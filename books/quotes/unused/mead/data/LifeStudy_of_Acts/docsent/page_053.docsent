   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Concerning Repentance and Forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to Peter s word in 5:31, the Lord is the Leader and the Savior to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God s chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His sovereign ruling causes and leads God s chosen people to repent, and His salvation based upon His redemption affords them forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Repentance is for forgiveness of sins Mark 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On God s side, forgiveness of sins is based upon His redemption Eph 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On man s side, forgiveness of sins is through repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Repentance and forgiveness are major gifts, and only the Lord Jesus as the Leader and the Savior is qualified to give them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No one else is qualified to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to realize that in this universe He is the only One qualified to give repentance and forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a positive sense, we have been caught by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we had not been caught, who among us would have repented?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>None of us would have repented if the Lord had not captured us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, the Lord compelled us to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, we would not have repented.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Repentance is not of us; repentance is a gift given by the exalted Leader and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following repentance, we received the gift of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise the Lord for the gifts of repentance and forgiveness!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise Him that He is qualified to give repentance and forgiveness to God s chosen people!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 5:32 Peter goes on to say, And we are witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God has given to those who obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Greek word translated things here is rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both the apostles and the Holy Spirit were witnesses of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that the Holy Spirit was one with the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this verse Peter says that God gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Obedience is the way and the condition to receive and enjoy the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SANHEDRIN S PROHIBITION AND RELEASE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Acts 5:33-40 describes the Sanhedrin s prohibition and release of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 33 says, But when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and intended to do away with them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Literally, the Greek words rendered cut to the heart mean being sawed through.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a strong figure for being exasperated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 34 continues, But a certain Pharisee in the Sanhedrin named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, stood up and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Pharisees were the strictest religious sect of the Jews Acts 26:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This sect was formed about 200 B.C. They were proud of their superior sanctity of life, devotion to God, and knowledge of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 35 Gamaliel said to the Sanhedrin, Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves regarding what you are about to do to these men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then after referring to the cases of Theudas and Judas the Galilean, he continued, Now I say to you, stay away from these men and leave them alone; for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest perhaps you even be found fighters against God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here Gamaliel spoke a very good word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Gamaliel was a pious, godly man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But was he in God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Did he know anything concerning God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Gamaliel was not in God s economy, and he did not know anything about it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Throughout the centuries many godly ones have been like Gamaliel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although they were pious and godly, they did not know anything about God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They had no understanding of God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Like Gamaliel, who did not know what the Lord was doing through Peter and John, these pious ones did not know what the Lord was doing in their time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 5:35-39 we see that Gamaliel was quite wise and also neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Notice his use of the word if in verses 38 and 39.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 38 he said, If this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then in verse 39 he went on to say, If it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead of taking sides, Gamaliel left the entire situation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He knew that if this work was of men, it would be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if it was of God and not of men, nothing could be done concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we have pointed out, although Gamaliel was godly and pious, and also wise and neutral, he did not know God s economy, and he was not in it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Throughout the years many have been like Gamaliel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They were very godly and pious, but no matter how godly and pious they were, they did not know what God was doing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From the case of Gamaliel we see that it is not adequate simply to be godly and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We also need to know how God is moving today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Where is God moving, and in what way is He moving?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since God is always moving, we must find out in what way He is moving.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Is He moving in the way of Roman Catholicism, or in the way of the denominations?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Is He moving in the way of Pentecostalism, or in the way of the inner life?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In what way is God moving now?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot believe that God is dormant.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since He is moving, we need to have the inner assurance, the inner satisfaction, that we know His move and are in it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need assurance concerning God s up-to-date move.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not be like those in the Sanhedrin, and neither should we be like Gamaliel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Instead, we should be today s Peters and Johns.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>From the record in the divine revelation we can see that Peter and John were in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They were moving with God, or, more accurately, God was moving with them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They had been motivated to move with God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How about us today?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I can testify that I have the assurance that the Lord s move is in and with His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Concerning this, we have the Holy Spirit as the inner witness.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>With Peter we can say, We are witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit also.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have the inner assurance and satisfaction that we are in the Lord s up-to-date move.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are not Gamaliels we are today s Peters and Johns.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>THE APOSTLES REJOICING AND FAITHFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those in the Sanhedrin were persuaded by Gamaliel.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After calling the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and they released them v. 40 . Therefore, they went from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the Name v. 41 . To be dishonored on behalf of the Name is to suffer shame for the Name.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is a real honor to be dishonored on behalf of the Name, the very name of the man-dishonored but God-honored Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hence, the sufferers rejoiced that they were counted worthy of this.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Acts 5:42 says, And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Here we see that the apostles preached the gospel in the temple and in the houses of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have the burden to follow this practice of preaching and teaching from house to house.</S>
