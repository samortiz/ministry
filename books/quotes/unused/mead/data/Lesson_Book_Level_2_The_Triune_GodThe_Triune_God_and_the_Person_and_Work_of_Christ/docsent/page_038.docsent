   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BRASS SERPENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Adam ate of the forbidden tree in Genesis 3, Satan, the old serpent, injected his evil nature into man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our nature was poisoned with Satan's nature and we became sinful, serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why we often behave the way we do like snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We also see this behavior all around us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament, when the children of Israel sinned against God, many of them were bitten by serpents and died.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When they cried out to Moses, the Lord told him to lift up a brass serpent on a pole.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone who looked at that serpent was forgiven, healed, and kept alive Num 21:4-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 3:14 the Lord said, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was lifted up as the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He died so that the serpent might be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Lamb, He died on the cross to take away our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But as the brass serpent, He died on the cross to destroy the old serpent, Satan, the Devil Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The brass serpent had only the likeness of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It did not have the poisonous nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same way, Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 yet He had no sin 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Christ destroyed Satan, He also did away with the satanic nature in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Satan is also the ruler of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The world is the system all around us which distracts us from God; it is the kingdom of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because Christ destroyed Satan, He also destroyed the world, his evil kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the brass serpent, Christ terminated Satan, our satanic nature, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That is Christ's finished work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We, however, still are bothered every day by our sinful flesh and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The world is always trying to draw us away from the Lord by stirring up the lust of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So, we must apply Christ as the brass serpent to our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Galatians 5:24 says that "they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 8:13 says that by the Spirit we can put to death the practices of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Take watching television as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You might realize that many things on television are unhealthy and dirty for our minds.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may also know that it can be a waste of your time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet, you may have experienced an uncontrollable urge to watch it, even against your parents' wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That desire comes from the stirring up of the passions and lusts of your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can you be saved from it?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can be saved by turning to the Lord, who is the Spirit in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit contains everything Christ did, including His death as the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you call on Him, the Spirit comes with Christ's crucifixion to kill your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is how we put to death the practices of our body by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is how we terminate the lusts and passions of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may fail sometimes that is why we have the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But do not use that as an excuse to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all need to call on the dear Lord's name to crucify the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What a shame to the Devil!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His efforts to use the world to attract our flesh will only cause us to call on the Lord even more!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is the Victor!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>QUESTIONS What was the goal of Christ's incarnation and human living?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why must Christ die as the Lamb of God as well as the brass serpent?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How can we apply what Christ has accomplished to our lives?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Quoted Portions from Lee/LSM Publications Stream Magazine Book Two, p.</S>
