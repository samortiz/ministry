   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GRACE GIVEN TO THE HUMBLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peter says that God not only resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Strictly speaking, this grace refers to the Triune God Himself as the life supply being multiplied in the humble believer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that the multiplied grace 1:2 corresponds to the varied grace 4:10 and all grace 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The believers have received the initial grace, yet this grace needs to be multiplied in them that they may participate in all grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The varied grace of God, as the all grace in 5:10, is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects 2 Cor 13:14; 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God gives Himself as grace, as life supply, to humble believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek word for humble in 5:5 also means lowly, as in Matthew 11:29, where the Lord Jesus says, I am meek and lowly in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be proud is to be high, but to be humble is to be low.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we would humble ourselves in the church life, we need to become lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead of uplifting ourselves, we should always keep ourselves low.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we shall be in a position to receive the Triune God as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We shall receive the grace God gives to humble believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>HUMBLED UNDER THE MIGHTY HAND OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 6 Peter says, Therefore, be humbled under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The words be humbled here are passive voice, indicating to be made humble by God, mostly through the sufferings of persecutions v. 10 . This, however, needs our cooperation with God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must be willing to be made humble, lowly, under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may say that humbled is passive, but be is active.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While God is acting to operate on us, we need to take the initiative to be operated on by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To take the initiative is active; to be operated on is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is our willingness to be under the hand of God, which is mighty to do everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Persecution may be used by God to humble us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, any kind of suffering may be used by God for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When good things happen to us, we may become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But suffering or persecution may help us to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, a brother may be humbled as a result of losing his job.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A student may be humbled by receiving a lower grade than he expected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If this student receives a high grade, he may be somewhat uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if he receives a lower grade, he may be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may also experience being humbled in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the children of a certain brother and sister are outstanding, the parents may become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if the children cause them problems or difficulty, this will make the parents lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, if a young brother s father has a very high position in his work, this brother may be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose his father is the president of a corporation or the chancellor of a great university.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Surely this brother would be proud of his father s position.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But suppose his father were a janitor with a very limited education.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Knowing that his father had such a lowly position may cause this young brother to be lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is humbled by the fact that his father does not have a high position.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I would like to emphasize the fact that in verse 6 Peter tells us to be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We cannot make ourselves humble.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, we need to be made humble by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nevertheless, God s humbling of us requires our cooperation with God s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that we must be willing to be made humble, lowly, under the mighty hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may say that be humbled is active-passive: be is active, pointing to our initiative to be humbled, and humbled is passive, pointing to God s operation to humble us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although God s hand is mighty to do whatever is necessary for us, His hand still needs our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God s operation needs our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we need to be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>EXALTED IN DUE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peter says that if we are humbled under the mighty hand of God, He will exalt us in due time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To be submissive to God s mighty hand, willing to be made lowly, is to take the God-honoring way that gives Him the ground to exalt us in His time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Willing to be made low by God s humbling hand in His discipline is a prerequisite to being made high by God s exalting hand in His glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Here we have the God-honoring way, God s humbling hand, and God s exalting hand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whether God will humble us or exalt us depends on our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may take a way that forces God to humble us, or we may take another way, the God-honoring way, that helps God to exalt us in due time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The words due time in verse 6 refer to the time God considers right to exalt us.</S>
