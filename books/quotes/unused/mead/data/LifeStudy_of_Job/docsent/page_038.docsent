   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Human Living</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus lived on earth for more than thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians, paying their attention to the miracles done by the Lord Jesus, do not know the real, spiritual, and intrinsic significance of Christ's human living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ's human living was just man living God to express the attributes of God in the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Crucifixion</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, the Lord Jesus went to the cross to be crucified there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the revelation of the New Testament, the death that Christ died on the cross was all-inclusive and also vicarious for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ entered into death and went into Hades to visit Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He stayed there for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He came out and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In resurrection He was begotten of God to be God's firstborn Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only so, in resurrection He was made the life-giving Spirit --not just a God-man but a Spirit that gives life 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, when He was resurrected to be begotten of God to be God's firstborn Son, He regenerated all His believers, making them the many sons of God and His many brothers as members of His Body 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From this we see that through Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, there is One who is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This One became the firstborn Son of God to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He also became the life-giving, life-imparting Spirit to germinate all those of the old creation who had been chosen by God to make them the new creation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now, after the day of resurrection, there are four marvelous things in the universe: the mingling of God with man, the firstborn Son of God, the life-giving Spirit, and the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ascension</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first four items in God's answer to the question concerning Job's suffering are Christ's incarnation, Christ's human living, Christ's crucifixion, and Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fifth item is Christ's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After His resurrection the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples during a period of forty days, and then He ascended to the heavens.</S>
