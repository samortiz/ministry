   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN BEING CREATED IN THE IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Genesis 1:26 God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, 1 Timothy 1:17 says that God is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since God is invisible, how could He have an image?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is this contradictory?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Speaking of the Son, Colossians 1:15 says, Who is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is invisible, but the Son of His love is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God cannot be seen, but one day Jesus Christ, who was the image of God, came.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, when God said, Let Us make man in Our image, that image referred to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God created man in the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all were created in the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us consider a suit as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My suit has two sleeves; hence, we can be sure that it was made according to my two arms.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If another person were to wear this suit, it would not fit him, because it was not sewn according to his measurements.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the suit fits me because it was sewn according to my measurements.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the suit is left in the closet, it will not have any meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the suit had feelings, it would feel empty and bored.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I wear the suit, it has meaning; it fulfills its purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>NEEDING TO RECEIVE THE LORD JESUS AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were created in the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means we were created in a way that matches Him so that He can enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the meaning of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The meaning of the universe is for God to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wherever God is expressed, the universe has meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God gains His expression in a subjective way, not in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since God desires to enter into man and be expressed through man, God created man in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is very special.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every light bulb emits light for the sole purpose of expressing electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if electricity is not transmitted into the light bulb, the light bulb loses its meaning of existence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The meaning of our human life is for God to enter into us and be expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The meaning of the universe is for a group of people to receive God into them to be their content.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, to be saved means to be rescued by God out of a human life that is void of meaning into a life that is full of meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now that we are saved, we have the meaning of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our life is meaningful because the Lord Jesus is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not think that man needs salvation merely because he is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if man did not have sin, he would still need to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man needs to believe in Jesus not mainly because he has sins but because without Him man has no meaning in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is just like a suit that needs to be worn in order to be meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man needs to believe in Jesus not merely because man is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if man were not sinful, he would still need Jesus, because man was created in God s image to express God, and thus, he needs to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Adam and Eve were created in the image of God, but they did not receive God s life into them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if they had not sinned, they still needed to receive the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This also applies to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not until we believe in the Lord Jesus and He comes into us that our human life becomes meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Bible uses the expression believe into John 1:12; 3:16 , meaning that we believe into the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we believe into the Lord Jesus, we also receive Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, we not only have His image but also His life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only so, He operates within us to transform and renew us so that we are conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all are in this process of conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus in us is the meaning of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In my youth I heard educated and learned men say that they do not need Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They said that only sinners, the poor and pitiful people, need Jesus, but people who are highly educated and have a high social status do not need Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They said this because they did not know what it means to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From now on we need to preach a high gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Everyone needs this gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must go and tell people that they were created in God s image in order to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Man was created in the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Man is an empty vessel and needs to receive the Lord Jesus into him to be his content.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only then can man find real meaning and satisfaction in his human life in this universe.</S>
