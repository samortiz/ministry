   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX A DOMINATING FACTOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DEAL WITH OPINION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we have spent several messages on the matter of opinion, we need to consider once more, not doctrinally but practically, how we can have no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Humanly speaking, it s altogether impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are just the embodiment of opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are just opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How could we as such persons have no opinion?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first point is not how to have no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first point is that we need to see a vision concerning what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What does God want of you?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You must see that God wants only Christ not Christ and but Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is not a strong subject, but is something subordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must see that God only wants Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am sorry to say that thousands and even millions of Christians have not seen this and don t care for this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So it is impossible for them not to have opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A DOMINATING FACTOR</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, although you may have seen this vision, it still may not have become a dominating factor in you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What you have seen as a vision must become a dominating factor in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must be dominated with this fact: that God wants nothing but Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you could see this vision and if you could keep this as a kind of dominating factor, you will be ninety percent successful in not having opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually there is no way to overcome opinion or to deal with opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Logically speaking we may say that we have to deal with our opinion and overcome our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But experientially there is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you have a way to overcome your opinion, that way becomes a replacing opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You simply replace opinion number one with opinion number two.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must see that God only wants Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As you see this everything else drops spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not say that everything will be dropped, but everything simply drops.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not use the passive voice but the active voice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you see the vision that God s unique desire is Christ with the church, and this vision becomes a dominant factor, everything besides Christ drops.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is really true.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need such a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every spiritual experience always depends upon Our vision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example we may preach against sin, but if people do not see a vision, they will simply pick up the knowledge that they are sinful and continue to do a lot of sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The principle is true in every item with the spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to see that God does not want anything but Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have to pray, Lord, have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To advise people not to have opinion is altogether not workable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if the church is under the light, the vision is here.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You see that what God wants is nothing but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He does not want your spirituality, your holiness, your prayer, not even your good virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He does not want your ability, your capability, your wisdom, your cleverness, your skill, or your patience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You have to see the vision that Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the main factor that cuts all the roots of anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Opinion may be considered as the main thing among all the things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Don t think that if you simply understand what I am saying you have gotten it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This depends upon the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Out of the nine hundred people who are here in this meeting, if only fifty percent could get into this vision, it would be marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You all need to pray, Lord, have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A VISION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First, if you would see such a vision you must have a humble heart, an open mind, and be poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You must hold a kind of attitude, aspiring for the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then you will see the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Learn not to reject even a little enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Just a little rejection covers your whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Be humble, be open, and be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hold an attitude of needing and desiring the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then the light will come.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have given many messages through the years that Christ in God s economy is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is the centrality and universality of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ is the hub and Christ is the rim of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whatever God is, is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We all need to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I realize that you know this and you have heard this but it must become a vision to you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You may know it but still not have a vision that Christ is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When you see this, everything besides Christ drops.</S>
