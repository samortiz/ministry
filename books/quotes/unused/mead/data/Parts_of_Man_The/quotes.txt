[1]  CONTENTS The Parts of Man and Their Purposes The Three Steps of the Lord's Salvation The Parts of Man at Different Stages
[2]  A very important verse in the New Testament is 1 Thessalonians 5:23, "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[3]  Just as our body has many parts, so does our spirit and our soul.
[4]  Thus, we love the Lord with our heart; we contact, receive, and contain Him with our spirit; and we reflect and express Him with our soul in all that we think, like, and decide in all that we are and all that we do.
[5]  If the Holy Spirit is in our spirit, then where is Christ?
[6]  Since Christ, as the life-giving Spirit, dwells in our spirit, we need to discern our spirit from our soul that we may contact and experience Him.
[7]  These are: 1 regeneration in our spirit, 2 transformation in our soul, and 3 transfiguration in our body.
[8]  At the very moment we receive Christ as our Savior, the Spirit of the Lord comes into our spirit to regenerate us by imparting Christ into our spirit as life.
[9]  From the moment we are regenerated in our spirit, it is the Lord's desire that this change of life continue by spreading into our soul, that our mind, our emotion, and our will may all be transformed.
[10]  We have Christ as life in our spirit, but we do not have Christ in our soul.
[11]  We need Christ to continually expand from our spirit into our soul till every part of our soul is transformed into His image 2 Cor 3:18, ASV .
[12]  Since Christ is in the spirit, when our mind submits to the spirit, it is submitting to Christ.
[13]  Thus, He is given the opportunity to expand from our spirit into our mind.
[14]  Formerly, nothing of Christ was within our mind, but when our mind submits to the spirit, the Lord has the opportunity to permeate, fill, and renew our mind with Himself.
[15]  In this way our soul is transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[16]  When our mind submits to the spirit and lets Christ as the Spirit occupy it, we have even the mind of Christ.
[17]  We must also be renewed in our emotion and will.
[18]  Since we have seen that our soul is composed of the mind, the emotion, and the will, then to deny our self simply means to deny our mind, emotion, and will that is, to deny our thoughts, our concepts, our desires, our likes, our choices, and our decisions.
[19]  Some are always in the mind, some are too emotional, and some have a strong will.
[20]  We must first realize that we have been regenerated and that Christ has come into our spirit.
[21]  Then we must learn to apply this indwelling Christ in our daily life.
[22]  The more we are with the Lord in the spirit, the more keen we will be in our mind.
[23]  But if we deny ourselves and take the Lord as our life, we will be very keen in our mind.
[24]  Our mind is a part of the soul, yet when it is set on the flesh it becomes a mind of the flesh, and when it is set on the Holy Spirit with our spirit, it becomes the mind of the spirit.
[25]  Whatever we do, we must first reject our natural mind, emotion, and will.
[26]  While we are listening to a brother speaking to us, we must reject ourself with our natural thinking in order to take the Lord in that particular matter as our life.
[27]  The Scriptures use two more terms to describe the fallen body of man.
[28]  Romans 6:6 mentions "the body of sin" and Romans 7:24 "the body of death."
[29]  When we received the Lord Jesus as our personal Savior, we believed in Him as the One who died for our sins and thus received forgiveness.
[30]  But something more wonderful has happened: Christ, the Lord Spirit, has entered into our spirit as our life to make our deadened spirit alive!
[31]  Christ, as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 is now in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , not in our soul.
[32]  Originally, we only had human life in the soul, and this soulish life was our person, our very being, while our spirit was simply an organ.
[33]  Since our regenerated spirit has been mingled with Christ as our life, we must live by our spirit, keeping the soul only as an organ to fulfill the purposes of our spirit.
