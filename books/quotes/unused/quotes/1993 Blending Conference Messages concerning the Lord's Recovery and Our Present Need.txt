We also need to abhor the situation in Laodicea being neither cold nor hot but lukewarm and being about to be spewed out of the Lords mouth
We should hate the deadness characterized by the church in Sardis and the lukewarmness characterized by the church in Laodicea
In order to be vitalized, we need to be blended with one another, not only as individuals but also as the churches
We need to learn the lesson of how to be enriched, how to be vitalized, to be living and active, by being blended together
After each message a number of saints from the churches will share to confirm the striking points in the messages
The Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine truths as revealed in the holy Scriptures, the holy Word of God
The divine truths are not according to what anyone thinks or imagines; they are revealed in the holy Scriptures, that is, the holy Word
The truths as revealed in the Scriptures have been lost, missed, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and wrongly taught throughout the ages
The first of the major items in the Lord's recovery is the accurate understanding and the proper definition of the Divine Trinity
In addition to these seven items, there are a number of other important items related to God's eternal economy that are not mentioned here
These items for the practices of the believers and the church are minor items and should not be considered major items of the Lords recovery
The term the consummated Spirit implies that the Spirit has been processed and thus has become the consummated Spirit
In the previous few decades the Lord has shown us the following points concerning His consummated, all-inclusive, and compound Spirit
All the above points that the Lord has shown us in the last few decades are great and crucial items in the Lord's recovery today
In the meantime, in the eighteenth century Zinzendorf recovered the practice of the church to some extent, but not in full
The oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the divine constitution by the Divine Trinity
The local ground of the church is basically the unique oneness of the Body of Christ practiced in the local churches
There is one unique Body of Christ in the whole universe, and there is one unique local church in each locality, respectively
The full knowledge of the Son of God is the apprehension of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience
To keep this aspect of the oneness we need to endeavor to 'drop all the minor and meaner doctrinal concepts that cause divisions
All the banners for this conference speak about the all-inclusive Christ, who has the preeminence, the first place, in all things
The Father always exalts the Son and the Spirit always testifies concerning the Son so even in the Triune Godhead Christ has the preeminence
Christ as God is the Creator, but also in God's eyes, when Christ was born as a man, He was the first item of all the creatures
History tells us that if you are under the calendar of a certain king, you are under the rule and reign of that king
If we are going to be vital, living and active, overcomers to carry out the Lord's recovery, we have to give Him the preeminence
To have the first love for the Lord is to give Him the preeminence in all things, in great things and in small things
When we buy a tie, when we get our hair cut, when we do everything, we have to give Him the preeminence, the first place
Those who give Christ the preeminence are the overcomers to carry out the Lord's recovery to rescue the church from its degradation
By His universal traffic from His incarnation through His ascension, in His descension and His ascension, He filled the entire universe
Everything they needed for their existence came out of this land, and the temple was the result of the enjoyment of this land
He became our Redeemer to take away our sin and our sins and to bring us back to God so that we can accomplish His New Testament economy
Finally, He is our life, our life-supply, and everything for us to participate in His riches for our enjoyment
Now we come to the second crucial point of the major items in the Lord's recovery, which is the consummated Spirit
Today our all-inclusive Christ with all His riches has been consummated as the Spirit to get into us for our enjoyment
In resurrection, which was His glorification , He became the Spirit of Jesus , the Spirit of Christ , and the Spirit of Jesus Christ
According to 1 John, this Spirit is now the anointing Spirit, who applies all that Christ is and has done into our being
Christ promised before His death and resurrection that He would give us the Spirit of reality, who would be in us
In the last book of the New Testament, Revelation, there is the ultimate consummation of every divine truth in the Bible
In the same way, it shows us the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, who is the ultimate, consummated Spirit
Revelation shows us first the sevenfold intensified Spirit for the overcomers in the degradation of the church
It is not improving us in an outward way but is metabolically transforming us from within by operating in us all the time
Praise the Lord that we are in the Lord's recovery where all these items are being recovered in truth and in practice
The church is composed of those who have been called out of the world by God to Himself for the fulfillment of His purpose
The church as the house of God is His household because this house is composed of all His children, who are His family
God needs a dwelling place the house of God the church of the living God in which He can dwell and this is a dwelling place of God in spirit
The house is for God's dwelling, and the Body is for Christ's expression so that Christ can be expressed on the earth
The divine element is Christ, but it has to be mingled with the human members, and this is what forms the Body of Christ
The fifth point of the crucial points of the major items in the Lord's recovery is the oneness of the Body of Christ
When He dispenses Himself into us, He mingles Himself with us so that we become mingled people, people who are mingled with the Triune God
Once the juice of the orange touches your tongue, you touch the essence, and the essence makes clear what it is
That means there is one Spirit in the Body of Christ, and that one Spirit is the very essence of the Body of Christ
These three things actually are the very Triune God Himself and are the basis of our oneness in the Body of Christ
The Spirit is the essence of our oneness, the Lord is the element of our oneness, and the Father is the source of our oneness
When you divide the Body of Christ, you are implicitly trying to divide the Triune God Himself, and He will never allow it
The oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness of the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, undivided and indivisible
The oneness of the Triune God is in the name of the Father , denoting the Father's person in which is the Father's life
The second element of the ground is the unique ground of locality in which a local church is established and exists
We see the church in Jerusalem in Acts 8:1, the church in Antioch in Acts 13:1, and the church in Corinth in 1 Corinthians 1:2
Christians today are divided because of different grounds other than this unique ground of locality, the genuine ground of oneness
The ground of locality protects and insures that a church in a particular locality will always be preserved in oneness
These three elements the oneness of the Spirit, the ground of locality, and the reality of the Spirit keep the genuine oneness of the church
Also, when the churches are clustered together, there is a stronger testimony, and there are the impact and the encouragement
In a small city of only fifty thousand people, there may be over one hundred different 'churches,' that is, different denominations
Some say that in a city where there are many thousands of believers, it would be impossible to have only one church
It brought us to meet with the Christians in our locality to stand there as a testimony for God in that locality
All the local churches are the one Body of Christ, and they are separated from one another only by the localities in which they exist
In our human body there is no separation of our hand from our foot, except that they are located in different places in the body
All the churches have the same life, the same nature, the same essence, the same element, the same source, and the same Triune God
In each locality there is some expression of the Body, but each local church, respectively, is still only a part of the Body
The local churches are autonomous in business affairs, but not in the testimony for Christ and in the fellowship of the Spirit
In such matters all the local churches are identical in nature and in function, as illustrated by the seven golden lampstands
The local churches are not for business affairs; business affairs are necessary so that the local churches can be the testimony of Christ
The local churches are autonomous in business affairs, but not in the testimony for Christ and not in the fellowship of the Spirit
The churches may differ in business affairs, but this does not mean that their testimony and fellowship are different
The churches' testimony for Christ and the fellowship of the Spirit should not only be local but also universal
In such matters all the local churches are identical in nature and in function, as illustrated by the seven golden lampstands
All the churches stood before the Lord as golden lampstands, meaning that in His eyes, in His view, each local church is divine in nature
What is universal is that in each situation the Spirit was speaking to a particular church, and the Spirit also spoke to all seven churches
Regardless of what the local situation and condition of each church may be, each local church is a golden lampstand
Although the local churches are many in existence, they are still one universally in element, and they all express that one element
The Father is the source of the Body, the Son is the element of the Body, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body
Corinthians 12:13 shows us that we were all baptized in one Spirit into the one Body and were all given to drink the one Spirit
The secret of the practice of the church life is not only the one accord in the local churches but also the oneness in the universal Body
How much we need to come out of our local boundaries out of our independence and practice the oneness of the Body by being blended together!
These churches are close to one another geographically; that is, they are in the same neighborhood with one another
Recently, the churches in Southern California have begun to practice to be blended together by clustering on the Lord's Day
There God blended the twelve tribes together as one, and He commanded them to come together three times a year in Jerusalem on Mount Zion
Such a blending is not only for our own mutual spiritual benefit but is also for the mutual building up of the Body of Christ
The clustering of the churches stirs up the neighboring churches in mutual love, mutual care, mutual intercession, and mutual shepherding
In Acts 11:27-30; 1 Corinthians 16:1-3; 2 Corinthians 8:1-4; and Romans 15:25-27 we can see examples of mutual care among the churches
Also, through the clustering the saints hear of the needs among the churches and receive the burden to pray for them
When the churches cluster together, they experience the mutual love, the mutual care, the mutual intercession, and the mutual shepherding
How wonderful that in the church life the Lord is recovering this matter of the clustering for the blending of the churches!
The Triune God is truly one: the Father and the Son are one, the Son and the Spirit are one, and the Spirit and the Father are one
According to the picture of the seven golden lampstands in Revelation 1, each lampstand shines individually as a testimony of Christ
According to the grammar of Ephesians 4:11, the term shepherds and teachers refers to only one class of gifted persons
According to Ephesians, the Body of Christ is something so mysterious that we cannot comprehend it with our natural understanding
If someone were to ask us what the Body of Christ is, we might only be able to tell them that the Body of Christ is the church
Something out of the Father, something out of the Son, and something out of the Spirit issue in the Body of Christ
The Body of Christ is also the issue of the transfusing of the ascended Christ in His attainment to be the Head over all things
Ephesians 1:5 says that God the Father not only chose us but also predestinated us, marked us out beforehand, unto sonship
In the same way, our heavenly Father has dispensed His divine life into us to make us His sons, the sons of God
In His choosing He intends to impart, or to dispense, His nature into us, and in His predestinating He intends to dispense His life into us
The first stanza of Hymns, 841 says that the Lord is our life, that He lives in us, and that we are sanctified by His holy nature
God the Father has put His life into us that we might be His sons, and He has put His nature into us that we might be made holy as He is
Verse 6 concludes this section of the blessings given to us by the Father by saying, 'To the praise of the glory of His grace'
God's redemption has brought us out of sin and into Christ; now we are in an organic union with this wonderful, all-inclusive Christ
Day after day by His secreting of His divine life into us, He makes us pearls, treasures, to make us God's inheritance
Christ put us into Himself, and He is secreting His life element around us to constitute us pearls, a treasure, for His inheritance
The sisters may desire to go shopping, not just to take care of their need but to satisfy their lust for material things
We have the essence, the element, and the life and nature of the Triune God all the time dispensed into our being
We are the Body of Christ because we have received the dispensing of the divine life, nature, element, and essence into our being
Christ is transfusing Himself as the ascended One into our intrinsic being to make us a part of Him, the ascended One
The issue of the transfusing of the ascended Christ in His attainment to be the Head over all things is the Body of Christ
The Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God and of the transfusing of the ascended Christ
Ephesians 3:8-11 reveals that the Body of Christ is the consummation of the ministering of the riches of Christ
The apostle Paul ministered the unsearchable riches of Christ into all of the believers, and such a ministry has a consummation
Once we were in sin as sinners, but through His regeneration, sanctification, and transformation we have been transformed and uplifted
Ephesians 5 tells us that the Body of Christ is the counterpart of Christ, and this counterpart is the bride, the wife
Some people think the church is an organization but the church the Body of Christ is an organism of the processed and consummated Triune God
Our physical body is an organism, but a chair is a mere organization of materials because it has no life in it
Ultimately, the church is a group of people who are in union with the Triune God and are mingled with the Triune God
The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is mingled with the believers
Now that we have seen what the Body of Christ is, we need to see the constitution of the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God
Ephesians 1:4 says that the Father chose us in Him, in Christ, before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish
To be holy is not only to be separated from everything common but also to be saturated with the very divine, holy nature of God
The Body of Christ is also constituted through the dispensing of the Son's element brought forth by His redemption
In Christ's all-inclusive death many negative things were dealt with, but on the positive side there was the release of the divine life
When we were regenerated, the sealing essence of the Spirit came into our being to soak and saturate us with the very essence of God
We need to see that through the dispensing of God's essence into us, there is the increase of gold and the decrease of clay
We have seen what the Body of Christ is and also how the Body of Christ is constituted with the processed Triune God
Now we need to see how the Body of Christ was formed through the baptism of the Spirit in the economical Trinity
In John 20 the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples in resurrection and breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Fifty days after Christs resurrection on the day of Pentecost the economical Spirit of the ascension power was poured out upon the disciples
Acts 2 shows us that on the day of Pentecost, the Jewish believers, the first part of Christ's Body, were baptized
By these two steps both the Jews and the Gentiles were formed into the Body of Christ through the baptism of the Spirit
Its growth is by the increase of the Triune God within all its members, who grow into the Head, Christ, in everything
Now that we have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body, we need to drink the one Spirit so that the Body may grow
The growth of the Body of Christ is not by the increase of knowledge but by the increase of the very God Himself as life
Day by day as we eat Him and drink Him, as we pray-read His word and call upon His name, we are taking in the very element of God Himself
As members of this Body, we grow unto maturity until we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Himself
The growth of the Body is by the increase of the Triune God within all its members, who grow into the Head, Christ, in everything
As we grow up into the Head in all things, we have something out from the Head for the building up of the Body
We need to grow up into the Head and then we need to function or operate out from the Head so that the Body can be supplied and built up
For the joints of the Body of Christ to be joined closely together is for them to be articulated and fitted closely together in harmony
We have seen that the church is not an organization, but the Body of Christ, the living organism of the processed and consummated Triune God
It was just a model that existed merely among the three of the Divine Trinity, the Father, the Son and the Spirit
We believe in the Triune God Himself who is the unique God in the universe, the Creator of heaven and earth and all the things in them
We also believe in Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, the One who possesses both divinity and humanity
Not only so, Paul said that we need to arrive at the practical oneness of our common knowledge of the Son of God
Jesus Christ as the Son of God is all-inclusive and all-extensive, yet the knowing of this Christ by all the believers varies a great deal
In the Lord's recovery, we know this Christ not only as the Savior, as the Lamb of God, but also as the all-inclusive One
Christ is so much to us, but because of the differences in the knowing of Christ among the believers, there is a lack of oneness
At the end of Ephesians 3 Paul said, 'To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever
Through the Body of Christ as the fullness of the processed Triune God, God can have an expression in the whole universe
The last Adam, of course, is the Lord Jesus in the flesh, and the life-giving Spirit is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit who gives life
According to the clear revelation of the Scriptures, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit the three of the Divine Trinity are one
In Galatians 3:27-28 the apostle Paul said that we were all baptized into Christ and we are all one in Christ Jesus
In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed three times that the believers of Christ would be one even as the Triune God is one
The Lord Jesus went to the cross to break down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, and create the two in Himself into one new man
In 4:4-6 we see the one Spirit as the essence, the one Lord as the element, and the one Father as the source of the one Body of Christ
The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers
These verses show the merging of the oneness of the believers with the genuine oneness among the three of the Divine Trinity
The third level of oneness is in the Father's glory, delivering us from ourselves and causing us to become fully one in the Triune God
In the evening of the day of the Lord's resurrection, He came to the disciples and breathed into them the life-giving Spirit
The disciples were eyewitnesses of three marvelous things: Christ's crucifixion, Christ's resurrection, and Christ's ascension
They forgot about all their own purposes and their own goals and came to pray in one accord to accomplish God's economy
When they had heard this, the apostles with the disciples offered a wonderful praise and prayer to God in one accord
With this one Lord there is the one faith, the common faith shared by all Christians concerning Christ's person and work
By faith and baptism we are transferred out of Adam and into Christ, thereby being joined to the Lord and becoming one spirit with Him
When we have Him as the three virtues of lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering, the condition of our heart is proper
No matter who they are and no matter what their condition is, the divine love will be released through our heart to bear them in love
On the cross He crucified the old man and abolished the ordinances brought in because of the fallen condition of the old man
Also, spiritually speaking, there is no possibility of any problem in our spirit, because we are those who are regenerated
Although the presence of the apostle may fluctuate, the Lord is with us all the time; His presence is continuous
When the apostle heard of the believers' conduct, he wanted to hear that they were standing firm in their mingled human spirit
Many Christians say that they are standing in one spirit, yet they may say this in a way of 'shaking hands over the fence'
When our souls are under the direction of our spirit, we can be one to strive together like a team of athletes
It has the taste of God, because it is something that issues out of God's very being, out of God's very nature
The Lord can accomplish His purpose for the satisfaction of His heart's desire only when we are thinking the same thing
When the Christ who is in our spirit saturates our entire being all the saints are lovely to us and we can love them all with the same love
According to the context of Philippians, the one thing here must be the subjective knowledge and experience of Christ
In the Old Testament type the anointing oil ran down upon Aaron's beard and eventually reached the hem of his priestly garments
When the element of sin entered into man, man began to live according to his fallen flesh and eventually became flesh
According to Galatians 5:19-21 these works include enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, and sects
One of the ingredients in the all-inclusive, compound, and consummated Spirit is the effectiveness of the cross
In order to experience this reality, we need to exercise to be fully in the mingled spirit so that the flesh will be cut off
In 1 Corinthians 1:10-13 Paul besought the Corinthians in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that there be no divisions among them
Christ's name should be the unique name among all His believers, and Christ Himself should be the unique person in His Body
Since Christ is unique and is not divided, the church as the Body of Christ also is unique and should not be divided
We also need to take the unique and undivided Christ as our unique center so that all the divisions may be terminated
Paul's word in verse 20 indicates that he would not consider that their coming together was to eat the Lord's supper
When divisive ones come together to take the Lord's table, it is not for the better, not for profit, but for the worse, for loss
Because of this, those who participated unworthily in the Lord's supper came under the discipline, the temporary judgment, of the Lord
All problems in the church can and should be solved through proper and adequate fellowship by praying together sincerely and thoroughly
Because leprosy is very contagious, a leper was put aside temporarily for the profit of the whole congregation of Israel
If a person is sick with a highly contagious disease, he should be quarantined, separated even from his family members, until he is healed
If anyone is spiritually sick of the disease of division, having become a divisive person, he must be quarantined
The entire book of Revelation is a prophecy of Jesus, and the reality of this prophecy is the testimony of Jesus
These things are in the book of Revelation but they are not the spirit the reality the substance disposition and characteristic of this book
Nothing in this whole universe can testify for God except a person by the name of Jesus Christ, the God-man, the embodiment of the Godhead
As the true and faithful Witness of God, He bears testimony concerning God in what God is, in what God did, and in what God would do
The objective denotation of the testimony of Jesus is the testimony by the believers with the church concerning Christ
It is also through His ascension to be made Lord, Christ, Ruler, and Savior to carry out His heavenly, church-building ministry
Finally, it is through His second coming to establish the eternal kingdom of God and to reign in the millennial kingdom
Our living should also be a testimony concerning Jesus' living a life of crucifixion in resurrection and concerning Jesus' work
The seven lampstands, the man-child, the firstfruits, the bride, and the New Jerusalem are clear signs with spiritual significance
The testimony of the lampstands is by the gold, signifying the Father's nature as the divine substance of the churches
The shape of the lampstands signifies the embodied form of Christ the Son as the manifestation of the churches
The shining of the seven lamps of the lampstands signifies the Spirit's expression as the bright testimony of the church to Christ for God
In order to be a proper Christian today, you have to overcome all the distractions and also the degradation of today's Christianity
They follow Christ as the Lamb of God wherever He goes, and they will be raptured before the great tribulation to Mount Zion in the heavens
The late overcomers overcome the persecution of Antichrist in the great tribulation, the last three and a half years of the church age
After the rapture of the dead overcomers with the living overcomers there will still be many believers left on earth who are not yet matured
Many of them will be martyred under the persecution of Antichrist and then resurrected with Christ to reign in the millennium
On the other hand, it is often easier to overcome in great and difficult things than it is to overcome in smaller and easier things
They may realize within that this is not of the Lord and that they do not need what they are going to buy, but they still go shopping anyway
When the Antichrist is ruling during the great tribulation, he will threaten people with death if they do not worship him
They will return with Christ to defeat Antichrist and his army at Armageddon as a close to the wars of the ages before the millennium
The two aspects of the testimony of Jesus are the total testimony for God by Jesus and by God's chosen and matured people
Revelation 1:9 says that John was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and because of the testimony of Jesus
Finally, the testimony of Jesus expressing the processed Triune God as the lampstands is in the Spirit's expression
The lampstands have three very crucial aspects 1 the gold as the substance 2 the stand itself with its form and 3 the lamps with the shining
We need to realize that if the Triune God had not been processed, He could not have an expression on this earth
Jesus Himself, the living person, was the first lampstand constituted with the Father Himself as the golden One
The seven golden lampstands as the testimony of Jesus are the reproduction, the duplication, and the continuation of Jesus
If we want to be overcomers within the churches, we need to overcome four 'isms': Judaism, Catholicism, Protestantism, and Brethrenism
These 'isms' are part of a big religious system organized by Satan, out of which the Lord's children need to come
During the Lord's time on earth and during the time of the early apostles, Judaism was strongly opposing God's testimony
In Revelation 2:9b the Lord refers to 'the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan'
The degraded recovered church thought that they were rich and had need of nothing, because they had so many rich teachings and doctrines
Verse 1 shows a great sign of a woman clothed with the sun, standing on the moon, and having a crown of twelve stars on her head
Revelation 12:2 says, 'And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth'
We want to be constituted to be the stronger part of this woman for the advancement of God's economy to bear the testimony of Jesus
He wants to drain the spiritual energy in your being by accusations, whether they are founded or not, to put a hole in your conscience
We overcome by the blood of Christ because that blood speaks for us and protects us from all Satan's false accusations against us before God
In this way we maintain the vitality and strength in our spiritual being so we can continue to further God's economy
Those in the manchild overcome the enemy by the blood of the Lamb by the word of their testimony and by not loving their soullife unto death
In the first part of Revelation 14, the believers who are the firstfruits are harvested and are standing with the Lamb on Mount Zion
If you ever planted anything and watched it grow, you know there is an anticipation for the day you can harvest it
The firstfruits will not be surprised that they have been raptured to be with the Lamb on the heavenly Mount Zion
At this point in time, the devil is not making war with the man-child or with the firstfruits because they have been raptured
Also, in Revelation 14 after the reaping of the firstfruits, you have a solemn warning that goes out to the whole inhabited earth
Right after this, there is a promised blessing to anyone who will be martyred during this period of the great tribulation
These are the late overcomers, the ones who have passed through the entire tribulation but have maintained the testimony of Jesus
We enjoy the consummated God, but Antichrist is another consummation, the consummation of all the evil powers in human history
We can see that this will be the darkest time, yet still the Lord gains a testimony through the weaker part of God's people
It will be terrible to be on the earth during the great tribulation, but there will still be the testimony of Jesus
The sixth sign of the testimony of Jesus in the book of Revelation is the bride of the Lamb as the aggregate of all the overcomers
When we cooperate with the Lord to love the Lord, we experience the indwelling Christ being lived out of us in our conduct
At the wedding feast this man was approached by the king, who said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment'?
What we need is the detailed embroidery work of the Holy Spirit by living Christ out as our subjective righteousness
Eventually, this bride will be the army with Christ to defeat and destroy Antichrist and his army at Armageddon
Antichrist and the false prophet will be thrown into the lake of fire, and Satan will be bound and thrown into the abyss
We want to pay the price to be the overcomers in this age who mature earlier to participate in the wedding feast of the Lamb
The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son has been realized as the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God
In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem as the ultimate mingling of God and man will be a triumphant show
God's redemption cleanses us from all our sins, and the cross eliminates all the negative things, but how can God be dispensed into man?
If it is only that we are cleansed and all the negative things are removed, there is nothing for God's testimony
Through His recovery the Lord has recovered the truth that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, and this truth can never be lost
In rejecting and opposing this truth, today's Christianity has lost nearly everything concerning God's economy
Because it does not fit into traditional theology, the truth of Christ being the life-giving Spirit is an offense to many Christians
The first title is the Spirit of God in God's creation, and the second title is the Spirit of Jehovah in His reaching of man
He was the Holy Spirit in the conceptions of John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus in order to sanctify humanity for Christ's incarnation
In the conception of John the Baptist the Holy Spirit came to an overage, elderly person in order to produce a son who was merely human
John the Baptist was full of the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb , but he had only the human nature and lacked the nature of God
He is working in us not according to the conception of John the Baptist but according to the conception of the Lord Jesus
Jesus was resurrected, and in resurrection He was glorified and was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit
These verses show that the way to drink from the springs of the Lord's salvation is to praise Him and call upon His name
On the evening of His resurrection, He breathed into His disciples and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Christ as the life-giving Spirit breathed Himself as the holy pneuma, the holy breath, the Holy Spirit, into His disciples
Every day we can drink Him as a wonderful drink, and moment by moment we can breathe Him in as the heavenly air
We do not have to be bothered by the natural life, the flesh, the self, and all kinds of negative things any longer
By taking in this new element of the processed Triune God we will be transformed into the same image as the resurrected and glorified Christ
We need the daily infilling of the essential Spirit of life as well as the daily experience of the economical Spirit of power
The word compound is used as a verb with reference to the mixing of different kinds of ingredients to make medicines and ointments
If a person has an ailment, a pharmacist may form a compound from many different ingredients in order to meet that person's need
The ingredients of this compound Spirit are clearly shown in the type of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30:23-31
The four spices blended with the one hin of olive oil signifies that in the compound Spirit humanity is blended, mingled, with divinity
Myrrh in the Bible was used for burial and is related to death; hence, it signifies the precious death of Christ
Cassia, which was used as a repellent to drive away insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ's resurrection
Through the moving of the anointing Spirit, all the elements of the compound Spirit are added into our inner being
In Acts 16 the apostles, having come to Mysia, were endeavoring to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them
He includes not only divinity, which He possessed from eternity, but also humanity, which He obtained through incarnation
The Spirit of Christ is therefore the totality, the aggregate, of the all-inclusive Christ with His all-inclusive death and resurrection
Because we have this Spirit of Christ in us, we have everything related to this all-inclusive termination and germination
The Spirit of Jesus Christ is for His bountiful supply in His death and resurrection that the believers may live Christ and magnify Christ
To magnify Christ is to show, declare, exalt, and extol Him without limitation, regardless of the circumstances
Although He was the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit, He was also the Spirit who was not yet
The seven lamps before the throne in Revelation 45 are for the shining the enlightening and the burning in carrying out Gods building work
Eventually, these seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God , and the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb
Every Sunday morning in their main service, they have a practice of one person speaking and the rest listening
The holy word in the Old Testament charged them not to appear before God empty-handed, without anything to present to God
Today most Christians come to their main service with nothing, expecting that someone will be there to speak to them
Nee also realized that if we stopped the onemanspeaking practice we would need something to replace it or we would not have anything
At that time we were not able to enter into the practice of the church meetings in mutuality revealed in 1 Corinthians 14
As long as this new way would not reduce us but give us some increase at a good percentage, we should be satisfied
Prophesying is not only speaking but also speaking rightly, speaking accurately, speaking audibly, and speaking with something rich
In this short time, by His mercy and grace, we have covered six crucial points of the major items in His recovery
It is of a certainty that we have the light and the truth concerning the Lord's up-to-date recovery, which is very rich and very high
We have to look to the Lord's mercy and grace desperately to get ourselves vitalized and to help others be vitalized
Whether we pray or fast, whether we pursue by ourselves or seek with others, at any rate, we must be vitalized
It is only possible to be vitalized if you yourself are pressed by the Lord to pursue Him desperately and absolutely in this matter
After being vitalized, you should not have a gathering of many saints to promote or to push this matter as a movement
After being vitalized, the only thing you should do is to seek the Lord's leading concerning whom you should contact among so many saints
You have to give your testimony of how you have been pressed by the Lord to seek Him in the matter of vitalization
You should also lead your contact to make thorough confessions to the Lord and also help him to pay the price at any cost as you have done
By this way a small group would spontaneously come into existence which will be vital, living, and active in the Lord's interest
Since you have been vitalized and have raised up such vital groups, you should pray for the church and the leading ones
As the Lord leads, you should give testimonies in the church meetings, but not in the way of condemning or of promoting or pushing
Do not look down on the weaker ones, the indifferent ones, and the ones that seem to be without any care for spiritual things
In conclusion, you should not expect to see that the church is altogether uniform and unified according to your view and practice
The church is not artificial by man's doing, but organic in the growth of the divine life with the growth of Christ in the believers
Today we must admit that the deadness of Sardis and the lukewarmness of Laodicea have come into the Lord's recovery
The recovery needs a revival of morale, a revival of impact, a revival of the dynamic motivation within us, a revival of vitality among us
A vital group can come into being only by a saint who is desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery
Such a saint must be desperate and absolute not merely to be vital he must be desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lords recovery
According to our experience, when we are desperate and absolute for the increase of the church, we have a burden to be vital
A vital group cannot be formed by promoting or by giving a message or by exhorting the saints to form vital groups
There are four basic requirements that we must take care of in order to become vital and to be sustained in our vitality
The basis of our blending, the foundation of our blending, is our fellowship, and our fellowship must be intimate and thorough
They had a wonderful, intimate, and thorough fellowship with one another day after day, and the Lord was speaking to them
It seems that they did not gain anything during the Lord's earthly ministry, but something was built up within them
After witnessing the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension, they and others who followed the Lord became different persons
If by the Lord's mercy we are able to experience such a blending, we will be absolutely different from what we are today
The New Testament tells us that we, as the many grains of wheat become one lump and eventually we become a loaf
The way to become a loaf is to be blended together in the groups by the intimate and thorough fellowship with much and thorough prayer
The second point is that we need to have a thorough confession of our sins, transgressions, defects, wrongdoings, etc
We need to have the thorough fellowship, and we also need to confess all of the hindrances that we may be blended together into one accord
Timothy 2:4 says that no soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please the one who enlisted him
If the priesthood became degraded, the Lord made a provision for others to become priests by voluntary consecration
During a time of degradation there needs to be people who voluntarily consecrate themselves to the Lord in an absolute way as Nazarites
Also, we need to pray unceasingly that we may be brought into the infilling and outpouring of the essential and economical Spirit
We do not need formal, religious, composed prayers, but desperate prayers in which we tell the Lord directly what we want Him to do for us
Transfuse Yourself as the Spirit into my being, my constitution, and pour Yourself out as the Spirit of power upon me'
If we are vital, we will realize that among the churches in Southern California there is a desperate need for the proper increase
The Lord has a great need to have the proper increase in the churches in Southern California, especially among the typical Caucasian people
Today we need to put away so many things that are occupying and preoccupying our hearts and pick up a burden for the increase of the church
After we pick up such a burden, we need to take definite action to go and contact others, either sinners or Christians
If we contact people in this kind of living way, they will see in us a living expression of the reality of God's New Testament economy
If we minister something real of Christ to them, the seeking unbelievers and the seeking Christians will be attracted
Fruit-bearing is our destiny, and to bear remaining fruit every year must be our definite goal with a strong determination
We need to consider all of our acquaintances, and we need the proper discernment in our consideration of whom we should labor on
We should spend our time to labor on those whom we consider to be promising and not waste our time on others who are not open
We need to consider people's condition, especially spiritually, and then act appropriately to meet their need in the gospel
If we do this, we will gain a clear vision of what their situation is, and this will lead us to contact them in the right way
Thank the Lord that we can bear the burden with the Lord in the vital groups to gain the increase for the Lord's recovery
Today what God needs are not merely saved souls but living members so that His Body can be built up to the fullest extent
God is not satisfied until every saved and baptized one is a living member who can be useful for the building up of the Body of Christ
Today in the Lord's recovery there is no better atmosphere in which the new ones can be raised up than the vital groups
In such a fellowship, the new ones will be nourished and cherished by the vital members of the group as nursing mothers
The apostle Paul considered himself a nursing mother in his care for the young believers in Thessalonica , and we need to follow his pattern
The vital persons within the group become the mothers who can nourish and cherish the new ones through the fellowship in the group meetings
Within six months some of the newly gained ones in these two churches were able to speak forth the truths with a certain measure
Before we can help the new ones to be fruitful, we must first become patterns to them by being fruitful branches ourselves
We need to help them to see that our goal is not merely to win souls but to convert sinners into living members of the Body of Christ
We should not delay in bringing our new ones into this matter, because they are able to gain others immediately after they are saved
The only way to accomplish this is to be desperate and absolute to practice all that the Lord has shown us concerning the vital groups
