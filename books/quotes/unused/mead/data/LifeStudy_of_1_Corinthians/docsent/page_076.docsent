   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE BUILDING WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH TRANSFORMED MATERIALS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:10-14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider from 3:10-14 the subject of the building work with transformed materials.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. NOT LAYING ANOTHER FOUNDATION,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BUT BUILDING ON THE FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>ALREADY LAID</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 3:10 and 11 Paul says, According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, but another builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But let each one take heed how he builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Doctrinally speaking, many Christians understand what it means not to lay any foundation other than Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, when writing these words, Paul was not speaking in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He realized that by saying that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas, the Corinthians were actually laying another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here Paul seems to be saying, Believers at Corinth, you should not say that you are of anyone or of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ, the unique foundation, has already been laid.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This Christ is the One who is both theirs and ours and also the One into whose fellowship we have been called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This Christ is the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is common for Christians to lay foundations other than Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, when someone declares that he is for immersion, he is laying immersion as a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The same is true of someone who is for tongues-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever you claim to be for a particular person, doctrine, or practice, you are laying another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the right meaning of Paul s word in verses 10 and 11.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christians have been divided by the many different foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thousands of foundations have been laid, and more are being laid.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, we should be careful not to say that we are of a certain thing or of a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To speak in this way is to lay another foundation; it is also to cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, in the church in our locality we should not say that we are of anything or anyone or that we are for anything or anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are only of Christ and for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is possible that even the saints in the local churches are laying different foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regarding this matter, my eyes are very watchful, not over Christianity, but over the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even the saints who love the Lord and His recovery may still say that they are for certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is to lay another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of laying another foundation, we must build upon the foundation already laid.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that we must build upon the unique Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should understand this not only doctrinally, but also practically and experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, suppose a brother tells you that, according to his feeling, the church in your locality is not positive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How would you respond to this?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The answer you give will reveal whether or not you are building upon Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The best way to respond is not to correct the brother or argue with him, but to pray-read a few verses with him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What matters in pray-reading with such a one is not the particular verses you choose; it is that you have a living spirit filled with the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then if you pray-read together instead of discussing the situation, that one will be watered and nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing waters others and nourishes others more than your living spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as your spirit is living and is filled with the riches of Christ, others will be watered and nourished, no matter what verses you pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After you have pray-read with this one, there is no need to argue with him about the church or to try to improve him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If he wants to say that the church is not positive, let him do so.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What he needs is not correction or adjustment, but watering and nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every time this one comes to you, simply water him and nourish him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a sense, such a one is spiritually sick, or he may be hungry and thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For his sickness, he needs some medicine, and for his hunger and thirst, he needs food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Each contact with him is an opportunity to water him and nourish him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, what is supplied to him will become the medicine that will heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After a while, having been nourished and healed, he will no longer say that the church is not positive.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He himself will realize that it is nonsense to speak in that way concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To fellowship with others with a living spirit full of the riches of Christ is to build upon Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is also to build with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When you contact others in this way, you build upon Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a result, others will be solidly built up into the church as part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is to build upon the foundation already laid.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am very concerned that the saints realize that 1 Corinthians is not a book of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is a book which deals with practical problems.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is a mistake to regard this Epistle as one based on doctrinal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may say that Ephesians is written with doctrine as the basis, but this is not true of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whatever Paul says in this book is presented in a practical way in order to solve the problems among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, his word concerning Christ as the unique foundation should be understood not doctrinally, but in a way that is practical and experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, to say that we are for a certain person or for a certain practice is to lay another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is a very serious matter to speak in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is to lay another foundation and to cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Furthermore, to minister Christ to others is to build upon the foundation already laid.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we would minister Christ to the saints, we must have spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not adequate merely to repeat in a doctrinal way messages given in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must share with others not a doctrinal Christ, but a Christ we have experienced.</S>
