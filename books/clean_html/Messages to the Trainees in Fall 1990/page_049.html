<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE PRACTICE OF THE ONENESS&#151;<br>WITH ONE ACCORD</H2><P>Now we need to see the practice of the oneness, which is with one accord (Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom. 15:6). In the Gospel of John, the Lord stresses the oneness, but in the book of Acts, He stresses the one accord. Acts is not a book of teaching but a book of practice. When the apostles and the believers practiced the church life, they practiced it in one accord. To be in one accord is to be in harmony. When we practice the church life, we must practice being in harmony. To say "amen" to one another in our speaking for the Lord and in our pursuit of the Lord is to be in harmony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE APOSTLE'S EXHORTATION<br>OF KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Ephesians 4:1-3 shows us the apostle's exhortation of keeping the oneness of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Walking Worthily of Our Calling</H2><P>Paul exhorted us to keep the oneness by telling us that we have to walk worthily of our calling (Eph. 4:1). The Lord called us into the fellowship of Christ in His Body. He called us into one Body, so we have to walk according to the oneness of this Body. The highest virtue of our Christian walk is to keep the oneness. In the teaching of the New Testament, the apostles cared for this to the uttermost. The keeping of the oneness is the primary virtue of our Christian walk.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By Bearing with One Another in Love</H2><P>In order to keep the oneness of the Spirit, we need to bear with one another in love with all lowliness and meekness and with longsuffering (Eph. 4:2). Lowliness is to remain in a low estate, and meekness is not to fight for oneself. We should have these virtues in dealing with ourselves. Longsuffering is to endure mistreatment. We should have this virtue in dealing with others. By these virtues we bear (not forbear) one another; that is, we do not forsake, but bear the troublesome ones in love. This is the expression of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. By Being Bound<br>in the Uniting Bond of Peace</H2><P>We also keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace (Eph. 4:3). Christ has abolished on the cross all the differences due to ordinances. In so doing He has made peace for His Body. This peace should bind all believers together, thus becoming the uniting bond.</P>
