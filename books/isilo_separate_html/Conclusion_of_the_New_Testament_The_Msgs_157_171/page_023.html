The church is such a supporting pillar and holding base of the truth. In this verse truth refers to the real things which are revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. The church is the supporting pillar and holding base of all these realities. A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church.<p>God&#8217;s New Testament economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the contents of the reality of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. As the pillar which bears the truth and the base which upholds the pillar, the church testifies the reality, the truth, of Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ.<p>We may also say that the truth in 1 Timothy 3:15 denotes the divine realities, the realities of our God. These divine realities are revealed in particular in chapters fourteen through sixteen of the Gospel of John. According to these chapters, the truth, the reality, is revealed especially as the truth of the Spirit. The Spirit is the Spirit of all the divine realities. Today as the pillar and base of the truth, the church holds the realities of the divine Being. God&#8217;s realities are testified by the church as the pillar and base of the truth.<h2 class=head5>(c) God&#8217;s Manifestation in the Flesh- the Mystery of Godliness</h2><p>First Timothy 3:15 and 16 indicate that the church is also God&#8217;s manifestation in the flesh-the mystery of godliness. God is manifested in the church, the Body of Christ, as the enlarged, corporate expression in the flesh. First Timothy 3:15b and 16 say, &#8220;The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness, who was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.&#8221; In Greek, the antecedent of &#8220;who&#8221; is omitted but easily recognized, that is, Christ, who was God manifested in the flesh as the mystery of godliness. The transition from &#8220;the mystery...&#8221; to &#8220;who&#8221; implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness (Col. 1:27; Gal. 2:20). This mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living is also the manifestation of God in the flesh.<p>These verses imply that not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body is the manifestation of God in the flesh. When a church grows in Christ with the growth of God (Col. 2:19), it will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on earth and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world. Then the church becomes the continuation of Christ&#8217;s manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness-Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh.<p>Such a church is the continuation, enlargement, and expansion of God manifested in the flesh. This manifestation of God is the church as the house of God and the pillar and base of the truth. The church is, then, the increase, the enlargement, of the manifestation of God in the flesh. This is God manifested in the flesh in a wider way. This is according to the New Testament principle of incarnation, which is God manifested in the flesh.<p>First Timothy 3:16 begins with the words, &#8220;And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness.&#8221; The conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; here indicates that the speaking about the church in verse 15 is not yet finished, and that the church is something even more than the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. The church is also the mystery of godliness. According to the context, godliness refers not only to piety but to the living of God in the church, that is, God as life lived out in the church to be expressed. The church life is the expression of God. Both Christ and the church, the Head and the Body, are the mystery of godliness, expressing God in the flesh. This is the great mystery confessed universally by believers in Christ. The church as the manifestation of God in the flesh is a mystery, the mystery of godliness.<p>The mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living is the manifestation of God in the flesh. When a church is well taken care of according to the instructions given in 1 Timothy, with the oversight of the elders and the service of the deacons fully established, the church will function as the house of the living God and as the pillar and base of the truth and will be the continuation and enlargement of the manifestation of God in the flesh. This manifestation began with Christ when He was on earth, and now it continues in the church. The church, therefore, as the manifestation of the invisible God is the mystery of godliness. If we have the proper church life through the reality of the kingdom, the manifestation of God, which began in Christ, will continue in the church.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
