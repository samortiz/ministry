   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEADENED BY THE FLESH, THE SELF, AND THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's body became the flesh, man's soul became the self, and the things of the earth were systematized to become the preoccupying world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a result, man's entire being has been usurped and deadened by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now there is no possibility for God to accomplish anything for His purpose because man has been deadened by the flesh, the self, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The human spirit is deadened by the flesh in the body, by the self in the soul, and by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more you live in the flesh and according to the flesh, the more dead you are in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In like manner, the more you live by the self, the more dead you are in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, living in a worldly way will deaden your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was our history.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Living according to the flesh, by the self, and according to the world, we were deadened in our spirit and were utterly finished with God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>DELIVERED FROM THE THREE DAMAGING ELEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus has come to redeem us, to bring us back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has come to deliver us from the three damaging elements: the flesh, the self, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He begins by quickening, enlivening, our deadened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that He has regenerated us, making our spirit alive, and now He dwells in our spirit to be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is by His being the life within us that we are gradually emancipated, released, and liberated from the flesh, the self, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to our experience, first we are delivered from the flesh, and then we are gradually delivered from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, with difficulty, we are delivered from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The deliverance from the flesh, the self, and the world is actually a cycle that is repeated again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may think that you have been thoroughly delivered out of the flesh, the self, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, you will soon realize that you need a further deliverance from a hidden aspect of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, you need the liberating Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 to release you again from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Following this, you will see that you need the liberating Spirit to release you more from the self and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This cycle will be repeated, and with each repetition you will be delivered further from the three elements the flesh, the self, and the world which damage humanity as the materials which God created for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually the Lord's recovery will reach the crucial matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we would realize the building up of the Body, we need to be delivered from the flesh, from the self, and from the world.</S>
