   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's Redemption Being according to His Economy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's redemption is according to His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In one sense, God's redemption has already been accomplished, but the application, or the practice, of God's redemption requires a long process.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the view of God's economy, we became fallen in Adam six thousand years ago Rom 5:12 ; Christ as the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world Rev 13:8 ; and we were regenerated through Christ's resurrection almost two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the view according to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sealed with the Spirit until the Day of Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, it takes time in God's economy for us to experience the redemption in Christ's death, in Christ's resurrection, and in the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were sealed by the Spirit when we were saved initially, and this sealing will proceed until the day of redemption Eph 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Redemption here does not mean to redeem our spirit or our soul but to redeem our body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our body still remains unredeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Redemption in its entirety was accomplished by God in an instant, but in practice and application redemption is still not finished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I believed in the Lord Jesus, I experienced His redemption in His death, but at that time I did not know redemption through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then I began to love the Lord, to seek after Him, and to love the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I studied the Bible for many years and eventually learned that redemption is not only through His death; it is also through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without Christ's resurrection God as life could not germinate us from death 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After my initial salvation, through more than seventy years I have learned one lesson: to follow the Spirit, to walk in, according to, and with the Spirit, to be in the Spirit and with the Spirit, and to be mingled and mingling with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am still learning this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In recent months I have often confessed, saying, "Lord, I am sorry that I did not do this according to Your Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>O Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I spoke to my wife, I did not speak according to Your Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have not finished learning this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the last step of His redemption, God will redeem our body at the fullness of the times.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At Christ's coming He will transfigure our body Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That will be the completion of God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have not yet been fully redeemed, but we are on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, the Bible says that we have been redeemed 1 Pet 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the other hand, it says that we have been sealed by the Spirit until the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 8:23 says that we who have the firstfruits of the Spirit groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When others ask us if we have been redeemed, we should say, "Yes, I have been redeemed, yet I still need to be redeemed."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if we have been redeemed in our spirit and our soul, we are still waiting to be redeemed in our body.</S>
