Then, when the church is strengthened and enlarged, it becomes not only the house in which God dwells, but also the city in which God rules. The church is the house for God&#8217;s home and the city for God&#8217;s kingdom.<p>We have also seen that the Psalms are of five books. Some versions of the Bible have all five books clearly indicated. Let us define them again. Book I, Psalms 1 to 41; Book II, Psalms 42 through 72; Book III, Psalms 73 through 89; Book IV, Psalms 90 to 106; and Book V, Psalms 107 to 150. It is good for us to remember the divisions of these five books.<p>As we have clearly seen, all the praises of the Psalmists began with the law. Because they were human, because they were religious, and because they were so well taught in the law, their concept was naturally law-centered. We cannot criticize them: that was their background. But they were near to God and open to Him, and they were deeply in fellowship with God. Hence, when they were praising according to their religious concept, the Spirit of Christ was given the opportunity to speak. It was in this way that their praises, though they did not realize it, were shifted from their concept of the law to the concept of God concerning Christ. In all the Psalms, there is this transition. It is like driving a car in one lane of the highway and then suddenly shifting unconsciously to another lane. While the Psalmist was scribing Psalm 1, someone who was subconsciously with him in the driver&#8217;s seat shifted to another lane in Psalm 2. His intention was to drive in the left lane, but eventually he shifted to the right, not by himself, but by someone subconsciously with him. This is marvelous! Hallelujah, the concepts of the Psalms have been shifted from the law to Christ!<h2 class=head1>INTRODUCTION OF THE HOUSE AND CITY</h2><p>In Book I, especially in Psalm 23, the concept of the house of God was introduced through Christ. By the shepherding of Christ in His resurrection life, the saints are led into the house, where they say, &#8220;I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.&#8221; It is immensely significant that the house is introduced in this way. All of Christ&#8217;s shepherding is to bring the saints into the house.<p>Next, in Psalm 24, we have seen that the holy hill is the stepping-stone for Christ to regain the entire earth. Thus, the hill is not only for the house, but also for the city. Therefore, in the first book we have the introduction of the concept of the house with the hill, which is for the city.<p>Following Psalm 24, we have all those Psalms in the last part of Book I, Psalms 25 to 41, concerning the house. Do you still remember all those verses? They are marvelous! We should pray-read those verses a hundred times!<p>Christianity, as we have seen, is poverty stricken in the application of the Psalms. There the Psalms are applied mostly for a kind of comfort. When you are sick, you may read a portion of the Psalms regarding the Lord&#8217;s healing. If you are in some other situation of need, the pastor may come and read Psalm 23, &#8220;The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.&#8221; Some advanced Christians, however, have seen something in the Psalms concerning Christ. Martin Luther, for instance, said that Psalms 110 and 118 are the greatest of all the Psalms, for these Psalms speak of Christ. This proves that he saw something of Christ in the Psalms. Some Christians, therefore, apply the Psalms not just for comfort, but for the experience of Christ. But it is rather difficult to find among all Christian books any book saying that in the Psalms we find not only Christ, but also the church as the house and city of God. Have you ever heard of such a book?<p>The Lord is merciful to us! He has drawn aside the veil and shown us that in the Psalms the primary concern is not comfort, but Christ, and following Christ, the church as the house and city of God. You must pray-read all these verses again and again until you are mingled and saturated with Christ and with the church as the house and city of God.<p>Many criticize and condemn our emphasis on the church. Why must the church be stressed? Because Christianity does not care for the church. Because Christianity is so unbalanced, the Lord must do some balancing. Have you ever seen the house of the Lord as the practical church life in the Psalms? Have you ever been taught concerning this matter? The house! The house! You have to see the house!<p>Consider again Psalm 31:21: &#8220;Blessed be the Lord: for he hath showed me his marvelous lovingkindness in a strong city.&#8221; It does not speak of any other strong things, but &#8220;a strong city.&#8221; Hence, so far we have the law, Christ, the house and the city.<p>We have seen how Book II begins with the house. The Psalmist speaks of the house in the way of remembrance. He recalls how in the past he came to the house of God with a multitude, with the voice of joy and praise. It is after these Psalms on the house, then, that we come to Psalm 45, where we encounter a richer and deeper experience of Christ. As Christ is known by the saints in a deeper way, He becomes the saints&#8217; sweeter experience in the local churches.<p>Following these deeper and sweeter experiences of Christ in such an intimate way, we come immediately to Psalms 46 through 48. These are three Psalms on the church as the city of God. In these Psalms we reach the climax of the city. The climax of the house is in Psalms 27 through 36; now in Psalms 46, 47, and 48, we have the climax of the city.<p>In Book I we have merely one short phrase concerning the city-&#8220;in a strong city.&#8221; That is all. But now, when we come to Psalms 46 through 48 in Book II, we reach the peak concerning the city. Book II is mainly for the city. Do you see the improvement? With the deeper and sweeter experiences of Christ, we have the climax of the city.<p>Psalms 46 through 48 tell us how God dwells in the city, His habitation, the church, to be experienced by the saints as their refuge, strength, and ready help, that in Christ He may be the King over all the earth.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Church Revealed and Typified in the Psalms &nbsp; pg 32</div><br></body></html>
