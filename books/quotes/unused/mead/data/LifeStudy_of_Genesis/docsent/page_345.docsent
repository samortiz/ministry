   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ's Complete Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The well for Isaac was a redeemed well vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This well, which Abraham had dug, was lost, having been violently taken away by Abimelech's servants v. 25 . Then Abraham redeemed it at the cost of seven ewe lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In typology, these lambs signify the full redemption of Christ, indicating that the divine living water has been redeemed, bought back, by Christ's full redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, while the whole human race is living by a source which is without redemption, we are living by a redeemed source.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The living water which we are drinking today is not natural; it has been redeemed at the cost of Christ's complete redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>c By a Covenant the New Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The well for Isaac also needed a covenant vv.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The covenant here is a seed of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our living water today is not only redeemed water but also covenanted water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ishmael drank of wild water, water that was without redemption and covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But all the water which Isaac drank was redeemed water, the water of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since we have begun to know Christ, the source of our living has also been the redeemed and covenanted water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>d For Planting</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Beer-sheba Abraham planted a tamarisk tree v. 33, Heb . A tamarisk, a type of willow tree, has very fine leaves, often grows near water, and gives the impression of the flowing of the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That Abraham planted a tamarisk after making the covenant for the well at Beer-sheba indicates that the water of which he drank was flowing in a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus said that whoever believes in Him will have rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church life today is by the well in Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you drink of this well and live by it, you will be like a tamarisk flowing with the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever people come to you, they will never sense dryness but will be refreshed by the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Beer-sheba, which means "the well of an oath," is the place where the church should be.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church should be at the well of an oath with a covenant, and should also be full of tamarisk trees.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all need to be a flowing tamarisk.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you look at the branches of a tamarisk tree, they will remind you of the flowing of the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Praise the Lord that there are some real tamarisks in the local churches!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here, at Beer-sheba, there is the planting, but with Ishmael in the wilderness there is wildness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christian groups today are like a wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They only make people wild.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the proper church life causes people to be planted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Have you been planted?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once you have been planted, you can no longer be wild.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this section of the Word it is clearly revealed that there are two sources of living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One is the natural source in the wilderness of our soul, whereas the other is the redeemed source in the garden of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At Beer-sheba, Abraham was contending for the well which had been so violently taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we also need to fight for the divine well that we may have it for both the Christian life and the proper church life.</S>
