   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we really love You; we also love Your word and Your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are sitting quietly before You to listen to Your speaking again.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, please speak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We want to be here listening to God speaking the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the previous chapter, based on Ephesians 4:4-6, we considered the constitution of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here I would ask you to read again that passage of the Scripture: "One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These three verses are the most mysterious and most excellent portion in the Bible that speaks forth the heart's desire of the Triune God and the highest purpose He desires to attain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is based on such a portion of the Word that we say that the building up of the Body of Christ is the constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with the tripartite men whom He has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed to His image, and glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is also based on this portion that we say that the Body of Christ is the union and mingling of God and His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Body of Christ is not merely a constitution but also a union and a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now I want to ask a few questions to help you see the crucial points revealed in these few verses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, from this portion of the Bible, how can we prove that the people redeemed by God are the outward framework of the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 4 begins with "one Body," not with "one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here the Body is mentioned before the Spirit because when we look at a person, we first see his outward body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that verse 4 begins with "one Body" proves that this Body is the outward framework of its inward element covered in the succeeding verses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, how can we prove that the Triune God is within this outward framework to be its content?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 6 says, "One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Divine Trinity is implied here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Over all refers mainly to the Father, through all, to the Son, and in all, to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All three are within the outward framework of the Body of Christ to be its content.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is indicated by in all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, how can we prove that in the Body of Christ the redeemed people become the new creation in the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This can be proved by one faith in verse 5.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through faith we believe into Christ John 3:16 , that is, into the Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, in the Body of Christ the redeemed people are in Christ, in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moreover, 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, "So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, in the Body of Christ, since the redeemed people are in Christ, they are a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The redeemed people as the outward framework of the Body of Christ have become the new creation in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Fourth, how can we prove that in the Body of Christ the old man and the old creation of the redeemed people have already been fully terminated?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One baptism in verse 5 is a proof of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Baptism is a burial; it is also a termination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through baptism the old man and the old creation of the redeemed people are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, in the Body of Christ there is no old man and no old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to have the reality of the Body of Christ, we must experience the termination of the old man and the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we still have a little of the old creation, we do not have the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to live a crucified life, experience the termination of the old man, and live out Christ, who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we will have the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Fifth, how can we prove that the Spirit as the essence of the Body of Christ is connected to the redeemed people's hope of the glorification of their body?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Concerning this point, verse 4 says, "One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our future hope is that our body will enter into glory, that is, the redemption of our body Rom 8:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ephesians 4:30 says, "...the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption of the body ."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be sealed is to receive the Holy Spirit as the essence Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The ultimate issue of this is the redemption of the body, that is, glorification Rom 8:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence Ephesians chapter four joins the Spirit as the essence with the hope of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A hope seems to be very far away, but the Spirit as the essence is so near to us and cannot be nearer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The glory that we will obtain is within us today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The essence is already within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One day it will be manifested, and that will be our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is like a seed sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First it puts forth sprouts, and then it grows leaves and blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To blossom is to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The glory of the flower comes from the essence of the seed, and the expression of the essence within the seed is the maturity of the essence within the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today there is an essence within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This essence will "blossom" in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That will be our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, the "one Spirit...one hope" mentioned in Ephesians 4:4 can be referred to as "one essence, one glorification."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many saved ones have experienced the Spirit within them as the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, before they were saved, the young sisters dressed themselves according to their own preference.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After they are saved, even as they comb their hair, there is One within them asking, "Is it right to comb your hair in this way?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some go to the movie theaters.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They also experience One within them following them and saying to them, "Go back."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These are very shallow illustrations to show us that we have a most precious thing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It entered when we were saved, and it will never leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the Spirit within us as the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Spirit as the essence is like the essence within the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One day it will "bud" and "blossom."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>That will be our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Sixth, how can we prove that in the Body of Christ the outward framework and the inward content are joined and mingled together to be one?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Ephesians 4:4-6 mentions that the Spirit as the essence within us is joined to the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It also mentions our being put into Christ through the one faith and the one baptism, and also that the one God and Father is over all, through all, and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, the Triune God is in us and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the joining and mingling of the outward framework and the inward content so that they become one.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now we need to go one step further to see how the building up of the Body of Christ is carried out through the co-living and co-walking of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The title of this chapter is "Through the Co-living and Co-walking of the Two Spirits in the Believers."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This continues the previous chapter, which says that the issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man is the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The building up of this Body is carried out through the co-living and co-walking of the two spirits in the believers, which is presented in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, these two chapters are connected.</S>
