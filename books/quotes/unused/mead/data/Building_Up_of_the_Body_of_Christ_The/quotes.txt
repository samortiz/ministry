[1]  The Building Up of the Body of Christ CONTENTS
[2]  The Saints Direct Building of the Body of Christ
[3]  OF THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22b-23; 4:7-12, 16, 15; 1 Cor 3:2, 6; 1 Pet 2:2
[4]  The fellowship in this book concerning the building up of the Body of Christ may be considered as a continuation of our fellowship in the book entitled The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity.
[5]  In the New Testament, there are many teachings concerning the building up of the church, which is the Body of Christ.
[6]  According to Ephesians 1, God s great power was wrought in Christ to raise Him from the dead v. 20a , to seat Him at His right hand in the heavenlies v. 20b , to subject all things under His feet v. 22a , and to give Him to be Head over all things to the church v. 22b . What God wrought in Christ with His great power is transmitted to the church.
[7]  The building up of the Body of Christ is through the gifts produced by the Head of the Body in His resurrection Eph 4:7-8,11 .
[8]  Through this procedure of the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, Christ s presentation of the captives to God, and God s returning them to Christ, all the captives became gifts.
[9]  All of our natural ability and strength mean nothing because being gifts given by God to Christ for His Body is something in Christ s resurrection, not something in the natural life by our first birth.
[10]  The gifted persons perfect the saints by nourishing them.
[11]  Just as we love and care for every member of our physical body, the Lord loves and cares for every member of His Body, the church.
[12]  Ephesians 5:29 says, For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church.
[13]  The church as the organism of Christ is built up with nourishment, the life supply, for the growth in life Eph 4:16, 15; 1 Cor 3:2, 6; 1 Pet 2:2 .
[14]  We must now consider how the prophets perfect the saints.
[15]  When we come together for a church meeting, there should be a number of the saints who can speak Christ and speak forth Christ.
[16]  To speak Christ and speak forth Christ is to dispense Christ into the needy saints that they can be nourished and have the growth in life.
[17]  OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:12-13, 15-16; 2 Cor 4:1; 3:8-9; Rom 5:18b; Jude 3b; Eph 2:15b; 4:24
[18]  We have seen that God s intention is to give the gifted persons the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers to perfect the saints that all the saints may participate in the work of the building up of the Body of Christ.
[19]  The corporate priesthood with Christ as the High Priest bearing all the people of God on His shoulders with strength and on His breast with love in the presence of God is the church life Exo 28:9-12, 15, 17, 21, 29-30; Heb 7:24-26 .
[20]  The Lord desires all the saints to be perfected Eph 4:13 , but the Bible shows us that the Lord is calling for overcomers.
[21]  These overcomers will eventually constitute the bride of Christ, and this bride will be the fighting army, following Christ to fight against and defeat the Antichrist Rev 19:11-21 .
[22]  The saints are perfected by the perfecting gifts with the life supply as the nourishment for the growth in life.
[23]  Ephesians 4:12 says that the gifted persons are for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[24]  According to the grammatical construction, the work of the ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ.
[25]  Thousands of believers may be doing a work of a thousand parts, but every part should be for the unique work of the unique ministry to build up the Body of Christ.
[26]  Paul referred to the building up of the Body of Christ, not to the building up of the church.
[27]  They did not see that in one city, regardless of how big that city is, there should be only one church, one local expression of the Body of Christ Acts 8:1; 1 Cor 1:2; Rev 1:11 .
[28]  They should not be brought into the realm of the church because the church is not an organization but an organism, the Body of Christ, with one life.
[29]  If we go to Japan and meet with the saints there, we are one with them because we are members of the unique, universal Body of Christ.
[30]  The saints are perfected unto the work of the ministry, the building up of the Body of Christ, until we the gifted persons and the saints all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[31]  BUT FULLY GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD Scripture Reading: Eph 4:14-16; 1 Cor 3:1; Eph 6:24 THE GIFTED PERSONS PERFECTING THE SAINTS
[32]  We saw in chapter two that the gifted persons were produced by the Head of the Body in His resurrection.
[33]  The Father returned these gifts to Christ, who then gave them to His Body to perfect the saints for its building up.
[34]  Yet in the real practice of the building of the church, Christ as the Head of the Body does not do the direct building work.
[35]  To prophesy is to minister Christ, to dispense Christ, into God s chosen and Christ s redeemed people.
[36]  We need to live Christ until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[37]  Ephesians 4:14 continues with the result of our reaching this goal: That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.
[38]  Paul used the phrase that we may be, indicating that he included himself.
[39]  These three items were troubling the saints and distracting them from God s New Testament economy, which centers on Christ and His Body, the church.
[40]  In addition to the many different teachings, there are also the different opinions from those who claim that they love the Lord and love the church.
[41]  They do not realize how much damage their opinions have done to the church.
[42]  In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul said that he had no commandment of the Lord, but he gave his opinion v. 25 . It is permissible to express our opinion, but we have to consider what the result of our opinion will be.
[43]  All of us believers are persons in Christ, but to what extent are we in Christ?
[44]  To give Christ the way to increase in the saints, we must feed them with Christ by ministering Christ, imparting Christ, dispensing Christ, to them.
[45]  BUILDING UP ITSELF IN LOVE Scripture Reading: Eph 4:15-16
[46]  In this chapter we want to see that the Body of Christ builds up itself in love.
[47]  We pointed out in chapter one that Ephesians 4:11-16 is the most crucial passage in Paul s writings related to the building up of the Body of Christ.
[48]  Ephesians 4:15 and 16 say, But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[49]  I hope that we can all take care of dispensing Christ as the life supply and forget about right or wrong, good or evil, yes or no. Let us forget about good or evil, right or wrong, and yes or no, and only care for Christ as our life and our life supply.
[50]  The members of the Body need to be joined closely together and knit together.
