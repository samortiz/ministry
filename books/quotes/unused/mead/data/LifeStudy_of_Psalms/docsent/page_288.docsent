   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The words "great land" refer to the entire earth, the whole globe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we see that Christ, who is the Lord, the Master Adonai , and who is at God's right hand, will shatter kings in the day of His anger at His coming back and will execute judgment among the nations 2:9, 12; Dan 2:44; Rev 2:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that Christ will be the greatest Victor, overcoming all the nations, shattering the kings and the head of the enemies, and executing judgment upon all who oppose Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition to being the King and the Priest, Christ is the Warrior to be the greatest Victor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Revelation 19, in His coming back He will be the fighting One.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, He will not fight alone against Antichrist and his armies from the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, He will come with His bride, a composition of all His overcomers, as His army, and with her He will fight against Antichrist and his armies.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Needing some water to drink, He will drink from "the brook by the way."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This brook is the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who offer themselves in the splendor of consecration are the dew of the morning to water Christ, and the overcomers are the brook to quench His thirst.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that He will be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To lower our head is a sign of defeat, but to lift up our head is a sign of victory, of triumph.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who lift up their head are the ones who overcome all the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To the enemies Christ is the Victor, but to us He is a Drinker.</S>
