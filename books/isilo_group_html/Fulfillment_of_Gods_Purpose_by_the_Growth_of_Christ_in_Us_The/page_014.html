Whatever we do in our Christian life must be for this purpose. Let us use the illustration of wives submitting themselves to their own husbands (Eph. 5:22). Even in this matter, there are these two aspects: expressing God and conquering God's enemy. If a sister who is a wife would not be willing to submit herself to her husband, this kind of rebellion would be a glory to Satan and a shame to God. But if the dear sister would be willing and able to submit herself to her own husband, this would be a glory to God and a shame to Satan. When a sister submits herself by enjoying the Lord within her, spontaneously she expresses God. God is expressed in her submission, and spontaneously Satan is conquered. The enemy, the devil, the evil one, is subdued. If a wife and husband are fighting each other, God is put to shame. God is not expressed. But if a sister submits to her husband out of her enjoyment of Christ, you can see Christ expressed in her submission.</P><P>Even in the smallest things in our daily walk, we need to express God. If we enjoy the Lord day by day, we will be dealt with by the Lord in the way that we dress. Something in us will be touched. When you are calling on the Lord, the Lord may say, "What kind of tie is this that you are wearing?" As you are combing your hair, the Lord would say, "How will you comb your hair?" The Lord will touch us in these little things as we remain in the fellowship with Him. Eventually, the way we dress will be the expression of God. Even in our dress, the enemy, the evil one, will be subdued. In the way that some people dress, you can see the darkness of Satan. Everything of our daily walk is either the expression of God or the expression of Satan. Either the enemy is subdued or he is prevailing.</P><P>But we also need to remember that the Christian life is not a matter of outward correction. Outward correction is not something of life. It is like the work of morticians, the work of outward decoration. They can make a corpse look presentable outwardly, but this is not the transformation of life. The transformation of life comes from within. As we call on the Lord, pray to Him, and pray-read His word, we enjoy Christ as life, and this life transforms us.</P><P>If we do everything in our daily life by enjoying the Lord, whatever we do will be the expression of God and the subduing of His enemy. Suppose another brother rebuked you, and yet you were so patient with him, without losing your temper, by the enjoyment of Christ. Others would be able to realize the expression of Christ and the conquering of the enemy with you. But this should not be your doing. This must be Christ's doing through your enjoyment of Him. Do not try to do anything by yourself. Never try to express God by yourself. Never try to conquer, to subdue, the enemy by yourself. If you try to conquer him, be sure that you will be conquered. We can never face our enemy, because we are not adequate. But praise Him, we have Christ as our life. Christ must get into us as our life so that He can live Himself through us.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of God's Purpose by the Growth of Christ in Us &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
