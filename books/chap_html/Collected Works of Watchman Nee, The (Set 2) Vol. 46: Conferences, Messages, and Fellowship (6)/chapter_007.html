<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE PLACE OF WOMEN</h1><p>God made man for expression; God made woman for storage. God made man a type of doctrine, and woman a type of experience. All doctrines are typified by man; all experiences are typified by woman. For example, Abraham typifies the doctrine of justification by faith, while Sarah typifies obedience and submission, which are experiences. Man represents objective doctrine, and woman represents subjective experience.</p><p>Paul said, "Does not even nature itself teach you..." (1 Cor. 11:14). Nature teaches many things, not just things about hair. There are certain things that are beautiful in a man, but these same things are ugly in a woman, and vice versa. Today there are many womanly men and many manly women. A masculine woman and an effeminate man are monsters.</p><p>The question is not whether a woman can express herself in the meeting, such as prophesying, etc. The question is whether or not she is standing on her ground as a woman. She can prophesy, but she should prophesy with her head covered, i.e., standing in her position as a woman, not standing in a position as a man. If a woman takes a man's position, she loses something womanly. It is all right for a woman to prophesy, but she must prophesy as a woman.</p>
