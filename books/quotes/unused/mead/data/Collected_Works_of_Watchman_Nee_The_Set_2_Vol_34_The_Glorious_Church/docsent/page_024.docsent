   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The work of the church on earth is to bring in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the work of the church is governed by the principle of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The saving of souls is under this principle, and so is the casting out of demons and all other works as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everything should be under the principle of God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why should we win souls?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For the sake of the kingdom of God not just because man needs salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must stand on the position of the kingdom of God whenever we work, and we must apply the kingdom of God to deal with the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord wants us to pray, "Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth" Matt 6:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the coming of the kingdom of God was automatic, the Lord would never have taught us to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But since the Lord asked us to pray in this way, He simply showed us that this is the work of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yes, the church should preach the gospel, but much more, the church should pray to bring in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people think that whether or not we pray, the kingdom of God will come automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we know God, we will never say this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The principle of God's work is to wait for His people to move.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then He will move.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God told Abraham that the people of Israel would come out from the nation which afflicted them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, this was not accomplished until four hundred thirty years later.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Israelites cried unto God, He heard their cry and came to deliver them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Never presume that whether or not we cry things will happen in their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God needs man to cooperate with Him in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God's people move, He will also move.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God's people saw that they should leave Egypt though not all the Israelites realized this, yet some did , they cried to God, and He moved to deliver them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even the birth of the Lord Jesus was the result of the cooperation of some of God's people with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Jerusalem there were some who were continually looking for the consolation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why the Lord was born.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the purpose of God is to bring in His kingdom, His part alone is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He needs the church to work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through prayer, the church must release the power of the kingdom of God upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord comes, the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ Rev 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since the work of the church is to stand for God and not give any ground to Satan, what manner of living should we have to accomplish this task?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All our sins and unrighteousness must be dealt with, our consecration to God must be thorough, our soul-life must be put to death, and our natural man must be abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ability of the flesh is absolutely useless in spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"I" cannot resist Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"I" must go!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever "I" goes out, the Lord Jesus will come in. Whenever "I" enters, there is failure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever the Lord comes in, there is victory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan recognizes only one person the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot resist Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fiery darts of Satan can penetrate our flesh, but, praise God, we can put on Christ who has won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We believe that Christ is going to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But do not think that the Lord Jesus will automatically come if we sit and passively wait.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No, there is a work which the church must do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the Body of Christ, we must learn to work together with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should never think that it is enough just to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must be concerned with God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are two consequences of man's fall: one is the problem of man's moral responsibility, and the other is Satan's usurping of authority over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, man suffered loss, but on the other hand, God also suffered loss.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Redemption solves the problem of man's moral responsibility and man's loss, but the loss which God suffered has not been solved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's loss cannot be restored through redemption; it can only be restored by the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Man's moral responsibility has been dealt with by the cross, but the problem of Satan's authority must be dealt with by the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The direct purpose of redemption is for man, while the direct purpose of the kingdom is to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Redemption gained what man lost; the kingdom will destroy what Satan gained.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Man was originally given the responsibility to overthrow the authority of Satan, but instead man fell, leaving the authority to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man himself even became subject to him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Satan became the strong man, and man became his goods Matt 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This situation demands the kingdom to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If there is no kingdom, then due to man's fall the work of Satan cannot be overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The new heaven and the new earth did not appear immediately after redemption was accomplished because the problem of Satan had not yet been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before the new heaven and new earth come, there must first be the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Revelation 11:15 says, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once the kingdom comes, eternity is ushered in. The kingdom connects with eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may say that the kingdom is the introduction to the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Revelation 21 and 22 show us that the new heaven and new earth appear after the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Isaiah 65 even describes the kingdom as the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that Isaiah viewed the kingdom as the introduction to the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, when the kingdom begins, the new heaven and the new earth begin also.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May God open our eyes so that we may not consider ourselves as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Why were we saved?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Was it just so we should not go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No. This is not the center.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Why then did Christ want to save us?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can answer this question from two different viewpoints from man's viewpoint and from God's viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we view the same thing from two angles, it is seen in a different light.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should not just consider this matter from man's viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must see it from God's viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In fact, the recovery of man's loss is for the recovery of God's loss.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God's loss must be recovered through the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Today God has caused us to share the victory of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Wherever the victory of the Lord Jesus is displayed, there Satan must leave.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must simply stand steadfast, because the Lord Jesus has already won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In His redemptive work, the Lord Jesus destroyed all the legal ground of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All of Satan's legal rule has been terminated through redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Redemption was the sentence by which Satan was deprived of his legal position.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Now the responsibility of executing this sentence is upon the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When God sees that the church has sufficiently fulfilled this task, the kingdom will come, and the new heaven and the new earth will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The new heaven and new earth in the book of Isaiah will lead to the new heaven and new earth in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Today we are standing midway between redemption and the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As we look backward, we see redemption; when we look forward, we see the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Our responsibility is twofold.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>On the one hand, we must lead the people of the world to be saved, and on the other hand, we must stand fast for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Oh, may we have this vision so that we see the responsibility committed to the church by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Let us review what the kingdom of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The kingdom of God is the realm where God exercises His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must have such a kingdom among us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>While we allow God to exercise His authority in the heavens, we must also allow Him to exercise His authority over us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God must have His authority, His power, and His glory among us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Not only must we seek to live before God according to Ephesians 5, but we must also pursue the responsibility revealed to us in Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Then we will not only be a church which is glorious, holy, and without blemish, but we will also be those who have cooperated with God to bring in His kingdom and caused Satan to suffer loss on this earth.</S>
