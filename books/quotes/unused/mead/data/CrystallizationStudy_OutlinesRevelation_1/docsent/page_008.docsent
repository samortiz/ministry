   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The crown of life, a prize in addition to salvation, denotes the overcoming strength that is the power of resurrection and that the overcomers have attained to the out-resurrection from the dead Phil 3:10-11.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The name being erased out of the book of life indicates that the name was already written in the book of life, a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings God has prepared for them Luke 10:20.</S>
