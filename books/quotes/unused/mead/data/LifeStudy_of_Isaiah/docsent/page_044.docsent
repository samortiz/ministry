   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>of the Sea, across the Jordan,</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Gloom does not remain in the place where there was anguish: formerly He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali contemptibly, but afterwards He treats the way of the sea, across the Jordan, with glory, Galilee of the nations" 9:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sea mentioned here is the Sea of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord now treats that part of the world called "the way of the sea" with glory.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Galilee of the nations was a despised place, but today we need to respect Galilee because it is the source of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is difficult to say whether the one hundred twenty were Jews or Gentiles.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One of these hints is the word concerning the Galilean believers from Galilee of the nations in 9:1.</S>
