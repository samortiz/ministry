   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth item of the enjoyment of Christ is the matter of food.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we turn to our spirit, we sense enlightenment, refreshment, and nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While we are reading the Word, we must learn not to exercise our mind too much.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we exercise our mind too much when we read, we will be exhausted instead of being satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must learn to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, praying more than we read.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we do this we will sense that we are being nourished, satisfied, and strengthened, having something of Christ ministered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would practice this, I cannot tell you what kind of sweetness, preciousness, and richness we would enjoy!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Christians do not have a time with the Lord, and many of those who desire to be with the Lord, do so in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many of these brothers and sisters study the Word and read it by exercising their mind too much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They do not know how to turn themselves to the spirit in order to touch the Lord and meet with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Learn to turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the only way to enjoy Christ as light, air, water, and food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we learn to turn to our spirit, the whole church will be turned, and there will be a great change in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>TURNING TO THE SPIRIT TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS THE ABODE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The last major item of the enjoyment in the spirit is Christ as our abode.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is only as you turn yourself to the spirit and remain there that you abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To remain in the spirit is to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you are abiding in Him and He is abiding in you John 15:4-5 , you have the sense that you are one with Him, mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At this time you realize that He is the vine John 15:1 and that you are one of the branches of the vine 15:5 enjoying all the richness, sweetness, and fatness of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the vine, He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are in Him and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We abide in Him, taking Him as our abode, and He abides in us to be the Dweller within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What a wonderful life this is in oneness with Him!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No human word can adequately explain this wonderful mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our abiding in Him and His abiding in us are a mystery, yet this mutual abiding is a fact, a reality, to be experienced by us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we must learn one thing and pay our full attention to this one thing, that is, to always turn back to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever we turn to the spirit, we will be in light, we will have air, flowing water, nourishing food, and we will enjoy Christ as our abiding place, our abode.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the proper way to enjoy Christ.</S>
