<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENTS OF THE MEETINGS</h2><p>The Christian meeting is a meeting gathered in the Lord's name. The church is the ekklesia, which means "the called-out assembly." A congregation of pew members is not the church. Such a congregation only provides a taste of a Sunday- morning worship service. Unfortunately, I think the meetings in Hong Kong somehow have developed such a taste. Perhaps Hong Kong has picked up the tradition of the past generations. Sometimes its meetings are almost the same as a congregation of pew members. This is the reason we have to change the Lord's Day morning meetings. Do not allow the brothers and sisters to sit quietly in the meetings; this is the same as not coming to the meeting at all. In the meetings, it is true that the brothers and sisters should not express their own opinions, but neither should they wait for someone to come and help them. Everyone should remember when they come to the meeting that they are coming to serve the Lord and serve the saints. They should not come with an attitude of only listening to a sermon.</p><p>Next, you have to help many people to function. Everyone should use his one talent. We should not wait for a strong speaker to come. Actually, when a church is weak, it hardly matters whether or not there are strong speakers. Only when the functioning ones in the church are so few does everything depend on speakers. All we need is a strong bread-breaking meeting and prayer meeting; there is no need to always have speakers. The issue is what takes priority. The speaking platform is clearly not the priority.</p><p>How the next generation fares depends on how this generation behaves. If God has a way among us, those who will be saved will not be like the ones we see today; they will be better. If you are faithful in Hong Kong, you will make the believers in Hong Kong the same as those in Kuling. In Kuling, unless one sheds tears and gives up his worldly possessions, he is not considered genuinely saved. The important thing is not how others criticize us, but how we are before the Lord.</p><p>Every Lord's Day morning we should preach the gospel. This should last for only thirty or forty minutes. The gospel message should be short. Once it is long, there will be no time to draw the net, and the fish will all jump out of the net. We have to capture the listeners with the Spirit of the Lord. Those who only have a burden to explain doctrines are in the realm of the mind; they cannot break down the strongholds in others' minds.</p><p>In our preaching we speak to men's minds, yet our main goal is to capture them with our spirit. You can follow the Kuling training in many things, but never in the length of its messages. You should not think that you can extend your time indefinitely as long as you are explaining the teachings clearly. You have to learn to subdue and conquer others with your spirit. If you are merely speaking to others' minds, you will waste much time, and the result will not be that good. The rest of the brothers and sisters also should learn to support the preaching with the release of their spirit.</p><p>The bread-breaking meeting should be conducted in the districts. The more we divide, the easier it will be to grow, and the more opportunity there will be for others to serve. If we do not subdivide our meeting into districts, the priesthood will be confined to just a few people.</p><p>There is the need of a new believers' meeting. All the saints should be treated as new believers in the beginning. Give them lessons. If a brother or sister cannot come, someone has to go to him or her to make up the lesson. If no one makes up the lesson with them, they will not be sustained. In making up the lessons, be thorough and careful. Do not be careless. You have to speak in such a way that they will want to come the next time. Unless you can do this, they will think that coming is optional, and your work will be very loose.</p><p>The workers should be careful and diligent. This is especially true in Hong Kong. If we are not careful, we will not get anywhere even if Hong Kong is blessed with many people. The present condition in Hong Kong is very precarious. The condition of the gospel is not proper, and the condition of the church is not proper. Consider, for example, the way the new believers' meeting is conducted. It is not serious enough. You are happy as long as the message is released. How can others receive the blessing if this is the way you work? Do you expect to see any fruit at all? If you want remaining fruit, you have to labor in the new believers' meeting in a genuine way. Everywhere in China the new believers' meeting is the strongest meeting. In Hong Kong it is the weakest meeting.</p><p>Hong Kong should be a place to produce people and money, but it seems that we have labored in vain here. Neither people nor money have been produced. This is because we have neglected the truth. Our words and our actions do not match. Some are able to preach a message on consecration, but they are not able to take the lead in consecration themselves. You have finished your fifty-two lessons for new believers already. What can you give to the new ones next time?</p><p>May the Lord pardon our shortcomings, and may He shine on us. May He grant us sufficient grace to offer up everything we have to secure His blessing.</p>
