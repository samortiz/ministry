   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 4 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 5:31-39, 43-44, 48</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>31 And it was said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorcement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>32 But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her who has been divorced commits adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>33 Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, "You shall not break an oath, but you shall render to the Lord your oaths."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>34 But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>35 Nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor unto Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King;</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>36 Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>37 But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>38 You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>39 But I tell you not to resist him who is evil; rather whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>43 You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>44 But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>48 You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Matthew 5:31-48 covers four laws.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verses 21 through 30 the Lord covered two laws that were complemented, the law regarding murder and the law regarding adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the four laws in this section, the laws regarding divorce, swearing, resisting evil, and loving our enemies, have all been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, regarding divorce, according to the old law, a man could divorce his wife simply by giving her a certificate of divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This law was ordained because of the people's hardness of heart; it was not according to God's design in the beginning 19:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The King's new decree recovers marriage back to the beginning designed by God 19:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only two things can break the marriage tie: either the death of one of the parties or fornication, adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If either party commits adultery, the marriage tie is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the principle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second, in verses 34 through 36 we see the Lord's new law regarding swearing: it is not to swear at all not by the heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem, or by our head.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All these things heaven, earth, Jerusalem, and even the hairs of our head are not under our control.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are nobody and we control nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to verse 37 the kingdom people's word needs to be simple and true: "Yes, yes; No, no," not convincing others with many words.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The evil one is seeking the opportunity to express himself through our excessive talking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not say too much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Simply say as much as is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not go any further.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we come to the third law regarding the resistance of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 38 says, "You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the old law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The new law is not to resist one who is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verses 38-42 reveal that the old law did not touch people's anger or their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the new law, the changed law, touches both our temper and our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The last law changed by the Lord is regarding enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Legally speaking, the old law v. 43 is fair and righteous; for a good neighbor deserves our love and an enemy deserves our hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, verse 44 says, "But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these laws kill our natural man, our natural taste, and our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the requirements of these changed laws reveal how much the divine life within us can do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These laws are not merely a requirement; they are a revelation, showing us that the divine life can even make us perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect.</S>
