   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament, the word church Matt 16:18; 18:17 in Greek is ekklesia, composed of two words: ek, out, and kaleo, called; the two words put together mean the called out congregation, or the assembly of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, according to the literal sense of the word, the church is the assembly of those called out of the world by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>208 There must be a great and thorough separation between the church as the ekklesia and the world as the system, the cosmos, of Satan.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, they become members of the household of God Eph 2:19 , the family of God....</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the house of God, the church is also the dwelling place of God on earth, the place in which God can have His rest and put His trust.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the church is the dwelling place of God in spirit v. 22 . In this dwelling place God lives and moves to accomplish His will and satisfy His heart s desire.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s kingdom is a matter of right and responsibility; all believers born into the house of God have the civil rights of and obligations in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>212</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a person is regenerated and born into the house of God, he enters into the kingdom of God John 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When he lives a life of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit in the church, he is in the reality of the kingdom of God Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he labors and works for the church according to God s intention, he labors and works for the kingdom of God Col 4:11 .</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God planned the church for the purpose of expressing Christ....The only way for the church to be the expression of Christ is for the church to be the Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not have the Head, we cannot have the Body.</S>
