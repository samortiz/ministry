   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-THREE CHRIST OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS Date: Friday, November 15, 1940</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 1:1; 1 Cor 1:30; Phil 3:9 INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have already seen that a saved person should know a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, he should know that he is a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, he should know God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third, he should know the righteousness of Christ and that Christ has become the believers' righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we want to consider the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is a big difference between these two things, and we must differentiate them clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most people think that after we become a Christian, everything of Christ becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Bible does not say that we are saved by the righteousness of Christ or that the righteousness of Christ has become our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The phrase the righteousness of Christ is only used in 2 Peter 1:1, in reference to Christ's own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without the righteousness of Christ, we cannot have a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the Savior because He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But His righteousness is only related to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The righteousness of Christ qualifies and enables Him to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we read the Bible, we should not change what we read.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not be satisfied with vague concepts and answers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During the past ten or more years, I have often asked others two questions: By what righteousness are we saved?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By whose righteousness do we come to God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people could not give the proper answer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They would say that they are saved by the righteousness of Christ and that they come to God through Christ's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let me put it this way: The righteousness of Jesus was the qualification which the Lord had before God when He was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This righteousness has absolutely nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are not joined to the Lord in His walk in this world; we are joined to Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything that the Lord did on earth has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must remember that a grain bears many grains only after it has fallen into the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christians were joined to Christ at His death, not at His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Christ was born in Bethlehem and lived on the earth, men could only follow Him from afar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They could only say, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only when we come to Romans 6 do we see that we are joined to Him in the likeness of His death and resurrection v. 5 . Therefore, a Christian does not become righteous in the eyes of God through the righteousness of Christ, but through Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are saved through receiving Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CHRIST BECOMING OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once I was talking to a theological student.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I said, "The Bible does not say that we have put on the righteous garment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It only says that we have put on Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Galatians 3:27 says that we have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today we have not put on the righteousness of Christ, but Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The righteousness of Christ is something that is in Christ Himself, and it is history.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today Christians come to God through putting on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ Himself has become our righteousness, and we can come to God at any time because Christ lives forever.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How can we, as sinful persons with so many failures, come to God?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why should God answer our prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One sister did not feel that temper was a sin, and she would not deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later, she could not get over a particular matter, and she wanted to have a thorough dealing before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She called me by phone and made an appointment to talk to me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I told her to go and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She took my word and went to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before she went to God, the subject of righteousness was not in her thought.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, as soon as she turned to God, the matter of righteousness came.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She thought to herself, "With what kind of righteousness should I come to God?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then she realized that her temper was a sin, and she acknowledged that she did not have any righteousness of her own.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A new believer very often prays and asks, "What is my basis for coming to God?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Suppose you are in your bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You can dress any way you like, but when you meet a guest, you have to properly attire yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No one ever dresses up to go to bed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is because you are alone when you go to bed, and there is no need to dress up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But during the day you have to meet people; consequently, you have to dress up.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the same way, as soon as a man comes to God, he considers how he should dress.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When a certain member of one's family is sick or in trouble and he is forced to come to God, he often suddenly remembers many sins that he has otherwise ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How do we come to God?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First Corinthians 1:30 is a great verse in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This verse reveals that a Christian does not come to God through his own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Neither does he come to God with his many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Rather, he comes to God through Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A Christian's access to God is not based on his righteousness or his unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This verse shows us clearly that Christ has become the righteousness of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is not something about Christ that has become our righteousness; rather, Christ Himself in His entirety has become our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Something of Christ can never be as absolute and perfect as Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When Christ Himself becomes our righteousness, God receives us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The experience of many Christians follows a certain pattern: If they read the Bible in the morning and manage to control their temper during the day, they can pray in a strong way at night.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if they fail during the day, their prayer at night is very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Actually, even when we sin, Christ is still our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The fact has not changed, because we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we behave well today and think that we are more qualified to come to God, we are coming to Him by our own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God does not receive us based on our righteousness, much less on our unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>His receiving is based on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A Christian does not become more unrighteous through sinning, nor does he become more righteous through doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Sin does not diminish a Christian's righteousness, nor do good works increase his righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Our righteousness before God is not dependent on our conduct, but on Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our righteousness before God never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Righteousness is a person; it is not a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The righteousness that a Christian has is the living Christ; it is not some dead object.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Even if we committed all the sins of the world, our righteousness is still Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Sooner or later every Christian must realize who this One is who is his righteousness.</S>
