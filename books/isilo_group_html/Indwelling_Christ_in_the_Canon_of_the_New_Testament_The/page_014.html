<h1 class="title">LIVING BY THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 14:17-20; 15:4a, 5</h1>
<p>From the past messages, we see that most Christian teachings have altogether missed the mark. The lost ones, of course, have missed the mark, but even those who are saved have missed the mark. Man realizes that in his own life there is a lack, but he does not understand what the real shortage is. Christians know that they have been saved, but most of them do not have a clear vision that God&rsquo;s intention is to work Himself into them as their life. Regardless of whether we are saved or not, God&rsquo;s intention is still the same, that is, to work Himself into us as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SHORTAGE IN MAN</h2>
<p>All human beings are short of something. In our daily life we are short of something. As husbands, we are short. As wives, we are short. Whether we are rich or poor, high or low, we are short. But so many do not realize that they are short. Even those that realize that they are short of God do not know that they are short of God as life.</p>
<p>Today on the earth there are many different things that appear good, yet they are so distracting. First there is religion. Then there is human culture. Besides this, there are the ethical teachings of many great philosophers and teachers. Many things are good, yet they are very misleading. Some may think that they are short of ethical teachings. Others may think that they are short of good character. But none of these things are our lack.</p>
<p>Perhaps some sisters think they are short of patience. In their home life with their husband and children, they always sense that they need more patience, and they always appreciate those who have more patience. But they really don&rsquo;t know what they are short of. The very ones they appreciate as having patience are also short. Those who don&rsquo;t have patience are short, and those who do have patience are also short. They are all short of the same thing.</p>
<p>What is it that we are all short of? Some will immediately answer, &ldquo;Jesus.&rdquo; This is right, but what do you mean by saying that we are short of Jesus? I am afraid that we have the same kind of saying, but a different dictionary. We say the same word, but our understanding differs. I have been doing this work for many years, and I still do not have the proper terminology or vocabulary. Some words are right, but they have been spoiled by Christianity, which has entirely missed the proper meaning of the proper words.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION</h2>
<p>In the past messages we have seen something of God&rsquo;s intention from the Gospels of Matthew and John. But I am still not confident that you have seen the matter. Someone would say that our shortage is Jesus. But who is Jesus? There are thousands of different definitions of Jesus. It is very difficult to define Him, and yet it is also very simple. The most difficult things on earth are the most simple. I am breathing now, but perhaps in thirty minutes my breathing will stop, and that would mean death. What then is death? It is hard to define. It is also hard to define life. These are the most simple things, yet they are the most difficult. It is the same with Jesus. It is simple to understand Him, yet He is the hardest Person in the world to understand.</p>
<p>All human history, including all of Christianity and all other kinds of religion have missed the mark. And the mark is so simple. God wants to work Himself into man, and He has never changed His intention. In creation, God&rsquo;s intention was the same. In redemption, God&rsquo;s intention was the same. In salvation, God&rsquo;s intention is still the same. For eternity, God&rsquo;s intention will be eternally the same. God has never changed His intention. It is to work Himself into you and me as our life. Whether we are saved or lost, this does not change God&rsquo;s intention. If we are lost, we need God&rsquo;s intention. If we are saved, we still need God&rsquo;s intention. If we hate others, we need it. If we love others, we need it. Whether we are old or young, we need it. Whether we are strong or weak, we need it. Regardless of what we are, who we are, or where we are, we need God to work Himself into us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Indwelling Christ in the Canon of the New Testament &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
