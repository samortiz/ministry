   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH BEING THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We thank the Lord for showing us that the building is taking place now.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Moreover, He has shown us the way to have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 2:21 says that all the building is growing, and the next verse says that we are being built together into God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, growing equals being built, and being built equals growing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that the proper building of the church is the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Ephesians chapter four we also have the thought of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 13 speaks of a full-grown man Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>, and verse 15 says that we should hold the truth in order to grow up in everything into the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, verse 16 speaks of the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even verse 14 has the thought of growth, for it says that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be no longer children is to have the proper growth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in Ephesians 4:13-16 the thought of growth is found in every verse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to these verses, the building of the Body comes through the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1954 I first began to minister on the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time, however, the light I received was neither clear nor complete.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I pointed out that, although hardly any Christians today care for the building or speak about it, the New Testament emphasizes it very strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we must care for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Using the illustration of the construction of a meeting hall, I told the saints that, like the materials in the building, they must have someone above them, below them, in front of them, behind them, and on both sides of them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I told them that they had to know who was next to them in order to be built up with them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I gave the same kind of messages in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, after 1964 I discovered the awkwardness of speaking of the building in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prior to that time, both in Manila and in Taipei, I could boast that I knew who was above me, under me, and beside me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, after coming to the United States, I found it awkward to say this, for I found it difficult to say who was beside me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I came to realize that this illustration is not accurate because it applies only to a material building, a building with lifeless materials.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once these materials are put into a building, they do not move.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We, on the contrary, are living building materials and are constantly moving.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Take the example of Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both in Rome and in Ephesus the church met in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because Aquila and Priscilla had been built in, there was no problem with them wherever they lived.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This type of building is much different from a building with physical materials.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not a material building; we are a living house, living people who move about from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE COMPLETION OF THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the entire universe God has just one dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The building of this dwelling place began, at the latest, on the day of Pentecost, and it is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The process of building will be completed, not at the time of the Lord's coming back, but at the end of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the New Testament, from the time of Adam until the time of the millennium there are four ages: the age of Adam, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The building of the church takes place during the age of grace and the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It began on the day of Pentecost, the beginning of the age of grace, and it will be completed by the end of the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then the fullness of time with the New Jerusalem will come.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the completion of God's building will be in the new heaven and new earth, which will appear after the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although the New Jerusalem comes at the beginning of the millennium, its full completion, the completion of God's building, will not be until the end of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although the building is going on today, the majority of Christians are not concerned about it and have no heart for it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They neither understand it nor speak of it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But God's mercy has reached us, our eyes have been opened, and we have a heart for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My heart is very burdened for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My heart has been on this matter since 1954, and I have written a number of hymns about it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today many of us have been captured by the vision of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have seen that what the Lord is seeking today is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without the building, there is no way for Him to come back.</S>
