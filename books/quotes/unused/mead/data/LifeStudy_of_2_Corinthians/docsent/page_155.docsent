   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX PAUL S VINDICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY 7 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 12:11-18 A WORD FOR ALL BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What Paul covers in 12:11-18 is neglected by many Christian workers today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the saints in the Lord s recovery need to understand what these verses reveal, for they apply to all of us, not only to those who are elders or co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not think that what Paul speaks of here has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What Paul was, what he did, and how he conducted himself are a pattern for all believers, not only a pattern for the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament reveals that all believers in Christ should, like Paul, live a life for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is revealed emphatically, strongly, and definitely in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Ephesians, every part of the Body must live a life for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unconsciously and subconsciously, we are still very much under the influence of our religious background.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are under the control, direction, and manipulation of traditional concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In particular, because of this influence, we may think that what Paul speaks of in chapter twelve is limited to leading ones, elders, co-workers, deacons, and deaconesses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may think that, as common members of the Body, this chapter has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, Paul s word is for us all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, it is rather difficult for me to say how many co-workers I have.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The understanding within me is that all of those who meet with us in the Lord s recovery are co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, because of the influence of our religious background, we may think that if we are not apostles, elders, or deacons, Paul s word in 12:11-18 does not apply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to read these verses with the realization that they are meant for us all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even the young ones among us should realize that these verses are for them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are not able to predict how far along the Lord will take our young people and how much He will use them in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I say this as an introductory word to our considering what is revealed in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 11 Paul says, I have become foolish; you yourselves compelled me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing I am inferior to the super-apostles, even if I am nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here Paul says that the Corinthians compelled Paul to become foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They bore the responsibility for this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They should have commended Paul, but they were distracted and withheld their commendation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their silence was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They should have done something to commend Paul, for it was not fitting for him to be compelled to speak concerning himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This, no doubt, was the feeling in Paul s spirit as he wrote verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should learn from this verse that there are occasions when we need to say something on behalf of the elders or those in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a certain brother is the target of attack or opposition, he may not be able to say anything to defend himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In such a situation we need to speak up and commend him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, years ago when Brother Nee was the target, I did something to vindicate him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The young ones especially need to learn to commend someone in such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They should be bold to speak out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They should not be silent, and they should not be held back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 11 Paul was compelled to point out to the Corinthians that in nothing was he inferior to the super-apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It certainly was not pleasant for Paul to say this on his own behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It should not have been necessary for such a word to be uttered by him, since he was the target of the opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A number of those in Corinth should have said this for Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They should have declared, You Judaizers must realize that Paul is not inferior to you in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we have pointed out, Paul had received transcendent visions and revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He surely was not inferior to those arrogant, boastful, self-commending Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But because of the silence of the Corinthians, Paul was compelled to say something on his own behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He said forthrightly that in nothing was he inferior to the boastful Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 11 Paul says that he was not inferior to the super-apostles, even if he were nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Of course, it is not true that Paul was nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He really was something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, he could not say this about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, he was compelled to point out that, even if he were nothing, he was not inferior to the Judaizers.</S>
