   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There was much blessing from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some sisters have truly advanced in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Soon we may have a gospel meeting in Chang's Garden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Chang Yu-zhi</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>June 18</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Lord so leads, I will go to Ch'eng-tu for a rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Presently, I have been providing hospitality for the brothers and sisters and also taking care of some literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps I will still help to translate the The Dynamics of Service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, I am afraid to travel in the next three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A few days ago I spoke with Brother Ke.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On his way home, he stayed in a hotel in Shiaoshing where he was interrogated by military police.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The letter of recommendation which he carried gave him some trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The military police did not understand terms such as "the meetings in various places" or "the Lord's table"; they thought that our brother was in some kind of secret society.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fortunately, God sent a nephew of his, whom he had not seen for seven years and who happened to be working there, and the matter was settled in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I feel that we should consider how we write the letter of recommendation in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brother Chang Yu-zhi</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>June 22</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps in the future in writing letters of recommendation, we should add the words in Christ after the word brother so that others will know that we are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is also not too proper to put "those meeting in the Lord's name" in the signatory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is better to explicitly say, "the church in such and such a place."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In principle we should make it as plain as possible Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Letters from Lan Tsi-yi, Hankow One</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the past two months, God has granted us grace in the churches in Wu-ch'ang and Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, He has perfected many believers in quietness to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, He has been saving sinners apart from our scheduled works.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Third, He has opened many doors for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we see that we are useless and powerless, the more we see His work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He teaches us that hidden prayers are more important than quick-paced work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Gradually I have come to know Him as the Lord of the work and the working Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May glory be to His name!</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Chen Yuen-sin has moved in with another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some of the wounded soldiers have received the Lord, and even some officers have asked for gospel booklets and Bibles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has shown me day by day that nothing is greater or more important than prayer.</S>
