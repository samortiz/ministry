        <h2 class="head2">The Second Way of Knowing and<br />
Experiencing the Cross</h2>
<p>Throughout church history only a few saints have come to know and experience the cross as Paul did. The majority of the saints, however, do not see such a great light when they are saved and constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love at the beginning of their Christian life. Such believers love and pursue the Lord, consecrate themselves to Him, and let Him gain ground in them. As a result of their consecration, the indwelling Spirit operates in them and enables them to sense the Lord&rsquo;s demands in every matter. The demands of the Lord are always related to death, that is, to experiencing the death of the cross in every matter. They may not have a deep sense of this demand from Him in the beginning, but gradually they have such experiences. Most believers know and experience the cross according to this sequence.</p>
<p>This way of knowing and experiencing the cross is inferior to the first way, the way of Paul&rsquo;s category. Believers in Paul&rsquo;s category see a great light at the time of their salvation. They see that the old creation, their flesh, their naturalness, and their self have been terminated on the cross. As a result, Christ has much ground in them to be their Lord in everything. The light that they see concerning the cross is so strong and thorough that it subdues their flesh, temper, naturalness, and self. However, most saints do not have this kind of knowledge and experience of the cross.</p>
<p>Most believers have a heart for the Lord after their salvation, so they consecrate themselves to Him with the desire to do something for Him and to be useful to Him. Because they draw near to the Lord and give Him an opening, the Spirit operates within them to give them a sense to deal with certain things. At first these demands relate to outward matters. However, the Lord gradually demands that they experience the death of the cross on the things in their inward being.</p>
<p>For example, when a newly saved brother consecrates himself to the Lord out of a desire to live for the Lord and to be useful to Him, the Spirit will give him a sense that the Lord is unwilling to use him because his love for movies has not been terminated. If by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, he deals with this matter, the Lord will have a way to touch the things that he wears. If the brother obeys this sense and submits to the Lord, he may receive a sense from the Lord regarding his temper being a hindrance to his usefulness to the Lord. When he receives this sense, he should confess and deal with his temper by giving it to the Lord. He should also condemn his temper.</p>
<p>Over time, such a brother will begin to be touched about deeper matters, such as his preferences, actions, and motives. The Spirit will not let him go in these matters. Whenever he expresses the self, the Spirit will give him a sense. For example, after giving a good testimony, he may feel proud and be exalted in his heart. Then the Spirit will touch him in regard to the presence of his self in the testimony, and he will sense his self-boasting and self-glorifying. If he is subdued by the Lord, he will confess his sins and ask for forgiveness. Later, when he and another brother express differing opinions while preaching the gospel, a voice within may say, &ldquo;You are so insistent on your opinion. Is this of yourself or of the Lord? Is it natural, or is it spiritual?&rdquo; When this brother senses that his insistence is of himself, not of the Lord, and that his reasoning is natural, not spiritual, he will be unable to pray until he submits to the breaking that comes from his acknowledgment of this sense. This breaking is a deeper and finer dealing.</p>
<p>As the Spirit&rsquo;s operation in him deepens, he will find it difficult to either criticize or praise people. In the early stages of being dealt with in this matter, a voice within will ask whether his criticism or praise is of himself or of the Lord and whether it is natural or spiritual. If he continues to deal with these inward matters, the Spirit will even begin to ask whether his prayer is of himself or of God and whether he is the one praying or whether God is praying. At this stage the Spirit&rsquo;s dealing is rather deep and severe.</p>
<p>Initially, the Spirit will touch our sins, temper, mistakes, and criticism of others. After dealing with these things, the Spirit will touch us in a deeper way. He will touch our good attributes, our good ideas, and our praise of others. At this stage our inner sense will not be related to whether our actions are right and our words are good but whether our actions and words are of Christ. Our actions may be right, and our words may be good, but they may only be of our natural self. Hence, the Spirit will show that even these things must be dealt with and rejected. If we deal with these matters, the Spirit will touch our prayer, which is deeper. He will ask whether He is the one praying in us or whether we are praying in ourselves. This experience indicates that the self must be terminated in both sinful matters and in our prayer. A Christian should abstain from sinning and also refrain from doing proper things by the self. To be a Christian is to put aside one&rsquo;s self in everything, whether in doing good or in doing evil, and to live by Christ completely, allowing Him to live in us and live out of us.</p>
<p>The Spirit will continue to touch us until everything that issues out of us, including our sins, temper, flesh, naturalness, and self, is terminated. The more we are touched by the Lord, the more we will be dealt with. The more dealings we have, the more we will advance. Then our inner eyes will see the cross in a deeper way. Initially, our view of the cross is limited. This is not because the cross is small but because our view is limited. Every touch of the Spirit increases our view; that is, the more the Spirit touches us, the more we see. As we are continually touched, our view is gradually enlarged until our inner eyes are fully opened. As a result, we will be like the apostle Paul, and we will be able to say, &ldquo;Lord, now I see that everything has been terminated!&rdquo; We will even ask ourselves why we exerted so much effort and why we had to pass through such a complicated process in order to see that everything was terminated on the cross. In this process we begin with a limited amount of light concerning the cross, and we are dealt with step by step until the light that we receive concerning the cross is full and complete. This is the experience of most believers in knowing and experiencing the cross. This way of knowing and experiencing the cross is good, but it is not the best.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
