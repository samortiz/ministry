<h1 class="title">THE NEED FOR A LOVING HEART<br />
AND A RECEIVING SPIRIT TO EAT THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:8; Psa. 73:1; Matt. 15:8; Psa. 51:10; 1 Cor. 2:16; Phil. 2:5; 2 Cor. 3:15-18; Eph. 3:16-17, 19b; 2 Cor. 13:14</h1>
<p>Mingling is a very basic concept in the Scriptures. God&rsquo;s ultimate intention is to be life and everything to us so that He may mingle Himself with us. At the time of creation man was made according to the image of God but did not have the life of God (Gen. 1:26). We were made as vessels of God so that He could be our content, our life, and our everything (Rom. 9:21, 23). We must realize that we are merely containers and that the Lord Himself must be our content. Thus, immediately after man was created, God offered Himself to man in the form of the tree of life (Gen. 2:9). God did not ask, demand, or command man to do anything. Instead, He only intended that man would take Him as his life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING VERSUS DOING</h2>
<p>Today there is a concept within us that is absolutely contrary to the thought of God. Whenever we think about God, we have the concept that we must do something for Him. We think that we have to worship Him, fear Him, do His will, and do good things to please Him. However, the basic thought of God in the Scriptures is that we would take God as our life in the same way that we take food. After God created man, He immediately brought up the matter of eating. At that time God did not tell Adam to do many different things; instead, He advised Adam to take care of his eating (vv. 16-17). God told Adam that he had to eat the proper thing. Our concept is not one of eating but of doing. We are &ldquo;doing&rdquo; and &ldquo;working&rdquo; Christians. The Lord&rsquo;s intention, though, is that we would be &ldquo;eating&rdquo; Christians. We should be those who eat and drink, not those who merely do things and work. If we eat properly, we will be the proper people. If we do not eat properly, we will not be the right people and will be unable to do what is right. We must realize that God&rsquo;s intention is that we would take Him as food. In other words, we must eat and drink of Christ as our spiritual food and drink (John 6:57; 4:10, 14; 7:37-38). If we feed on Christ and drink of Him, He will be everything to us, and we will be the proper people.</p>
<p>Thus, we must first pay attention to the matters of eating and drinking, not the matters of doing and working. If someone came to the Lord, asking, &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; the Lord might answer, &ldquo;You must eat Me and drink Me. I am like a piece of bread; I am the bread of life. He who eats Me shall live because of Me&rdquo; (John 6:35, 57). It is not a question of what we should do but a question of what we should eat and by what we should live. It is not a matter of doing and working but a matter of eating and living. We must eat the Lord in order to live by Him. When we take the Lord as our food, He can live through us. May we all have a change in our concept.</p>
<p>One time after I had given several messages on this subject, a brother came to me, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, the messages have been wonderful, but now that we know that we have to do the Lord&rsquo;s will, what should we do?&rdquo; I clearly told him that it is not a matter of doing or working but a matter of eating, drinking, and living. Our responsibility is to eat Christ, drink Christ, and live Christ. The Bible tells us that the Lord is the bread of life and that he who eats Him will live because of Him (John 6:48, 57). Thus, we must eat the Lord and feed on Him. We are also told that the Lord is the living water, the water of life (4:10). Thus, we must also come to Him and drink Him. Furthermore, the Lord is our life, and it is no longer we who live but the Lord Himself who lives within us (Gal. 2:20). We need to live in the Lord, by the Lord, and for the Lord. May we all have a real change in our concept. We must forget about our doing and working and instead deal with our eating, drinking, and living.</p>
<p>Once a sister came to me, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I know that as a sister, a wife should submit to her husband, but to tell you the truth, I simply cannot submit to my husband. Can you tell me what I should do? I feel so helpless.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It is good to feel helpless. The more helpless you are, the more you are unable to do anything. Those who are helpless and dead cannot do anything. You must forget about doing anything.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;But what should I do when I go back home?&rdquo; Again, she was raising up the matter of doing. After some consideration, I said, &ldquo;Let us kneel down and pray together, and when you go back home, the first thing you must do is kneel down to contact the Lord.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I cannot kneel down and pray to the Lord, because I know that He wants me to submit to my husband, but I do not want to. How can I go to the Lord and pray to Him?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Just go to the Lord and tell Him what you have told me. Tell Him, &lsquo;Lord, I know that You want me to submit to my husband, but I do not want to.&rsquo;&rdquo; As soon as this sister contacted the Lord, there was a willingness within her to submit to her husband. This was not her doing; this was the issue of her eating. She contacted the Lord and was strengthened by Him and satisfied with Him. Because she ate the Lord, she received a little more mingling with the Lord and was able to live by Him. This is the basic thought of the whole Scriptures. We all must learn to practice eating and drinking the Lord. Only by eating and drinking the Lord can we take the Lord into our being. If we go to the Lord, contact Him, feed on Him, and drink Him, wonderful things will happen as an issue of our eating and drinking Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Experiencing the Mingling of God with Man for the Oneness of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
