   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This calling One is the very God 3:4, 6, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Hebrew word for God is Elohim, which means the mighty One who is faithful in His oath.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is not only mighty, but also faithful to fulfill His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we would be called by the Lord, we must realize that He is mighty and faithful, mighty to do everything for us and faithful to keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>D. The God of Our Father</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 6 says, Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The phrase the God of thy father denotes history with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God comes to call you, He should not be a stranger to you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He is a stranger as far as you are concerned, then you are not qualified to be called by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To say that God is the God of our father does not mean that He is the God of our father in the flesh, for our natural father may not be a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we were saved, we gained another genealogy, a spiritual lineage.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason Paul told the Corinthians that he begot them in the gospel 1 Cor 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul was not married, and thus he had no children in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But he had a great many spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every believer in Christ has a spiritual father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the eyes of God, the Lord who calls you is the God of your spiritual father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moses father in the flesh was a godly man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, when God called Moses, He referred to Himself as the God of thy father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates a history with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God appeared to Moses and called him, He was not a stranger, for He had been with Moses family for generations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The God of Moses father was the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that God is the God of every kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may be a good person like Abraham, a somewhat neutral person like Isaac, or a supplanter like Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But whatever we are, God is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is the all-inclusive God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever God comes to call you, He is always the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is the God of our father, and He is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These titles of God also indicate the God of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The covenanting God is for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No matter who you may be, He is your God, and He is qualified to call you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>E. I Am That I Am</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we come to the most wonderful title of God: I AM THAT I AM 3:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 14 the Lord instructed Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s name is I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, His name is simply the verb to be.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not qualified to say that we are.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are nothing; only He has being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, He calls Himself, I AM THAT I AM.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Chinese version speaks of Him as the self-existing One and ever-existing One.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I Am denotes the One who is self-existing, the One whose being depends on nothing apart from Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This One is also the ever-existing One, that is, He exists eternally, having neither beginning nor ending.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In John 8:58 the Lord Jesus said, Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I am.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the great I Am, the Lord is the eternal, ever-existing God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have seen that in 3:14 the Lord told Moses to say to the children of Israel that I Am had sent him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The words I Am are not a complete sentence, but function here as a name, even a unique name.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This name, as we have seen, is actually the verb to be.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only God qualifies to have this verb applied to His being, for only He is self-existent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You and I must realize that we are not self-existent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As I Am, God is everything we need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To the words I Am we can add whatever we may need.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Are you tired?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The I Am is your rest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Are you hungry?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is your food.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Are you dying?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the New Testament the Lord uses many things to describe Himself: I am the true vine John 15:1 , I am the bread of life John 6:35 , I am the light John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As I Am, God is everything heaven, earth, air, water, trees, birds, cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not pantheism, the religious belief that identifies God with the material universe.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not say that everything is God, but I do declare that God is the reality of every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This implies that God must be you, even the reality of your very being.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We can say to Him, Lord, You are me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the Lord is not us, then we are nothing, and we have no reality.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This great I Am, the all-inclusive One, is the One who has come to call us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not heresy to say that our God is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is a truth full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only those who are blind and who are in darkness oppose such truth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I can testify that for the more than fifty years of my Christian life the I Am has been sustaining me.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because of His sustaining me with what He is, I have never backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Furthermore, I have been able to continue in the ministry for more than forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I know the One who called me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have been called by the I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The One who called me sustains me all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No human language can adequately express what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>F. Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Finally, the calling One is Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews 3:18, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The word Hebrew means river-crosser.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The river-crossers are a separated people, people separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we would be called by God, we must see that, as the calling One, God is the God of the river-crossers, the separated people.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As such a God, He is not the God of those in Babel nor is He the God of those in Egypt, because they are not separated.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we are not separated from the world, God cannot be our God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He is not the God of the Egyptians, but the God of the Hebrews, of the people who have crossed the river for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
