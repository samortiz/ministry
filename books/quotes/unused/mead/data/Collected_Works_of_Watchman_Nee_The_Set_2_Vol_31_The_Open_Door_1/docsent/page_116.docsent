   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Three</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The three of us went out into the streets for seven afternoons passing out gospel tracts and preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We hung up pictures and sang short songs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The bustling crowds would gather to listen as we shouted out the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We took turns speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When one was preaching, the others would stand by his side and pray quietly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The audience came in groups and took turns listening.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some went, but others stayed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each time we preached, two to three hundred people stopped to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have not seen an outward result yet; we do not know whether anyone has received the word at this time or whether they will receive it later.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is probably the first time the gospel has been preached outdoors in Ku-Jiu.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No matter what, Christ was proclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We believe that His inward working is never in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord also gave us an opportunity to testify to those in the government.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the evening of April 10, we had the first table meeting in Ku-Jiu with Brother and Sister Gung.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was sweet even though the number was small!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the fifteenth we had a special gospel meeting in Brother Gung's house for the neighboring women.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Three or four people raised their hands to show that they wanted to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We had a meeting for more than three hours on the afternoon of the seventeenth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first half was for preaching the gospel, and the second half was for a message on the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many brothers and sisters received this kind of truth joyfully.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was a table meeting in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There were five brothers and two sisters from that locality in addition to the three of us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Six or seven of the brothers and sisters in Ku-Jiu have seen the truth of the local church and want to walk in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May the Lord lead them through His own leading.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the last Lord's Day evening, we prayed together in one accord and committed the newly established church in Ku-Jiu and the responsible brothers Brother Gung and Brother Ruan to God and His word of grace Acts 20:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We left Ku-Jiu by train on the eighteenth and went to Shi-Ping.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a day's train ride from Ku-Jiu to here.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are looking for God's own leading concerning the work here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to rise up to pray more for this, and we need the brothers and sisters in all the localities to pray as well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will tell you the rest later.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May the Lord's love be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Your brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>K. H. Weigh, Lin Kwang-tsao, Chen Hsi-wen</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Soon to Enter Sikang Province</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Huang Jung sent a letter from K'un-ming on April 20, saying, "Brother Hsu Jung-jieh and Brother Hu Yi-ming will soon put their luggage on their backs and enter Sikang province to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have heard that the roads are dangerous and that the bandits are very numerous.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to pray earnestly for our brothers who are pressing on without caring for their health and safety."</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have stopped the Bible study for beginners temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am not completely clear about the way I will take in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the past few weeks, the brothers and sisters have become low in spirit, and I do not know why.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is as if they have fallen into mud and cannot pull their legs out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I feel much pressure inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can see that the flesh is totally useless.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If God does not give grace, who can bring anyone into spiritual reality?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After passing through this trial, I have really seen that if the apostles do not have the power, all their work will become an outward endeavor and will be dead and burdensome.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I really ask for God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not know why God has chosen such a useless vessel as myself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If I were not clear about God's call, I would throw up my arms in resignation.</S>

   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Living Water Teahouse is next to a theatrical troupe, and one of the troupers marvelously received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He came to me one evening and said that he had been praying for a long time, asking Jesus to open the way for him to make a living doing something else.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He no longer felt right about singing in the troupe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I felt that his word was sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Unfortunately, he moved to another place today, so I did not have the opportunity to care for him!</S>
