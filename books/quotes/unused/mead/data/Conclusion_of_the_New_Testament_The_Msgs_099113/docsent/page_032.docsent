   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIX THE BELIEVERS THEIR DESIGNATIONS 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in the New Testament the believers in Christ are designated disciples and believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall cover the two remaining designations of the believers in the New Testament saints and Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>C. SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many verses in the New Testament speak of the believers as saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 9:13 and 32 refer respectively to the saints in Jerusalem and to "the saints dwelling at Lydda."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Romans 1:7 says, "To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 8:27 tells us that the Spirit "intercedes for the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 12:13 speaks of "communicating to the needs of the saints," and 15:25, of the ministry to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word "saints" denotes those who are holy, separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are not only believers in Christ we are saints of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are God's holy people, a people separated unto God for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those Who Have Been Separated and Made Holy unto God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The term "saints" denotes those who have been separated and made holy unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Saints are separated ones, those who have been set apart to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 1:2 says, "To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The expression "called saints" indicates that the believers in Christ are the called saints; they are not called to be saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a positional matter, a sanctification in position with a view to sanctification in disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to grammar, in 1 Corinthians 1:2 "to the church of God" is in apposition to "to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that "to the church of God" equals "to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This strongly indicates that the church is a composition of the saints and that the saints are the constituents of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The two should not be considered separate entities.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Individually, we are the saints; corporately, we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, in 1:2 "called saints" is in apposition to "those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of saying "called saints," the King James Version says, "called to be saints."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to this translation, being a saint is pending; it is not already an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Paul did not say that we are called to be saints; he says that we are called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we turn away from ourselves and look at Christ, in whom we have been sanctified, we shall be able to declare that we are saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We shall realize that a saint is simply a called one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be called by God is to be separated unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, those who have been called into military service have been separated from civilian life and drafted into the service.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This illustrates God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we were called by God we were separated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, we have been sanctified; that is, we have been separated unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because we have been called by God unto His purpose, we are the called saints.</S>
