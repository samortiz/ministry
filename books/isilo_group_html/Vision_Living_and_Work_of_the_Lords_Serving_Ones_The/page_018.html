OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In order to experience Christ, we must know that Christ is the life-giving Spirit with many elements; He is the compound Spirit. In our experience the all-inclusive compound Spirit manifests mainly the element of the all-inclusive death, that is, the cross of Christ. This compound Spirit manifests a particular function: it kills everything that is not Christ. As we experience this all-inclusive Spirit, everything in us that is not Christ will be killed. To experience such a killing is to experience dying with Christ.</p>
<p>Romans 6:6 says, &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him [Christ].&rdquo; Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ.&rdquo; Ever since the time of the Reformation, all Christians who pursue the Lord know this truth. Martin Luther even wrote some articles concerning Galatians 2:20. However, not many Christians have been able to comprehend in their experience that the Christ who indwells the believers as their life is the Spirit of life. Mrs. Penn-Lewis said that in order to experience the death of Christ and the cross of Christ, we must first experience the inner filling of the Holy Spirit. In other words, when our spirit is filled with the essential Spirit, we experience the death of Christ. However, Mrs. Penn-Lewis did not point out why we experience the death of Christ when we have the infilling of the Holy Spirit. Not until these last thirty years did we see that within the Spirit of life there is a very important element. That element is the death of Christ. Hence, this Spirit has a killing function.</p>
<p>In a pharmacy some medications are compounds. These medications contain not just one but many ingredients. When a person takes a tablet, he receives all the ingredients with their many functions: one ingredient may kill bacteria, another may strengthen him, and still another may provide nutrients to meet the various needs of his body. This is an example of the compound Spirit. This Spirit contains many elements.</p>

in the Type of the Compound Ointment<br />
in Exodus 30</h2>
<p>The type of the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30 clearly shows the various aspects of the compound Spirit. The holy anointing oil is composed of one hin of olive oil mingled with four spices. This holy anointing oil is a type of the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>More than fifty years ago I learned from the publications by the Brethren that the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30 is a type of the Holy Spirit. However, the Brethren did not point out that the holy anointing oil includes four spices. When these four spices are mingled with the olive oil, the oil becomes an ointment. According to this type there was only the Spirit of God, typified by the olive oil, before the tabernacle was built. It was not until the tabernacle was being built that God instructed Moses to prepare the holy anointing oil by adding four spices to one hin of olive oil, which typifies the Spirit of God, in order to make the holy anointing oil that was to anoint the tabernacle. The tabernacle denotes the Lord Jesus, who is God incarnated to tabernacle among us (John 1:14). Hence, from the incarnation of the Lord Jesus until His resurrection, the four elements&mdash;typified by the four spices&mdash;were mingled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This holy anointing oil, a compound ointment of olive oil and four spices (Exo. 30:23-24), is a full type of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the processed Triune God, whom Christ became through His death and resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; John 7:39; Phil. 1:19). The significances of the ingredients of this compound anointing oil are as follows: (1) flowing myrrh, a spice used in burial (John 19:39), signifies the precious death of Christ (Rom. 6:3); (2) fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death (8:13); (3) fragrant calamus, from a reed that grew upward in a marsh or muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ (Eph. 2:6; Col. 3:1; 1 Pet. 1:3); (4) cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (Phil. 3:10); and (5) the olive oil as the base of the compound ointment signifies the Spirit of God as the base of the compound Spirit (Gen. 1:2). Since the number four signifies the creatures (Ezek. 1:5), of which man is the head (Gen. 1:26), and the number one signifies the unique God (Deut. 4:35; 1 Tim. 2:5), the four spices signify the humanity of Christ in God&rsquo;s creation, and the one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God with His divinity. Thus, the blending of olive oil with the four spices signifies the compounding, the mingling, of God and man, of divinity and humanity, in the compound Spirit (cf. Lev. 2:4). The olive oil and the four spices were all prepared through a process of either pressing or cutting, signifying that the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9) through Christ&rsquo;s sufferings (Matt. 26:36). Furthermore, the measure of the four spices, being three complete units of five hundred shekels each, the middle five hundred shekels being split into two parts, signifies the Triune God in resurrection, the second, the Son, being &ldquo;split&rdquo; by His death on the cross. Since in the Bible five is the number for responsibility (25:2), the five elements in the compound ointment and the three units of five hundred shekels of the four spices signify the Triune God in resurrection as the power, the capability, for bearing responsibility. Since the numbers three and five are related to God&rsquo;s building (Gen. 6:15), these numbers in the compound ointment signify that in the compound Spirit there is the element for God&rsquo;s building. Based on the above significances, the compounding of the four spices with the olive oil to make an anointing oil signifies the mingling of the above-mentioned elements with the Spirit of God through the process of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to produce the compound Spirit for the building of God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place. The ointment in Exodus 30 signifies that the Spirit of God became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Furthermore, &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; spoken of in John 7:39 is the compound Spirit. This compound Spirit is an ointment. An ointment is not only oil. This is also the anointing spoken of in 1 John 2:27. A picture is worth a thousand words. Through the picture of the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30 we are able to know the compound Spirit thoroughly.</p>
<p>In these years the Lord has led us in a complete way to know the Holy Spirit. Not only has He led us to know that the life-giving Spirit is the compound Spirit; He has also led us to see the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6), the Spirit that is intensified sevenfold in function. The Lord has also shown us the essential and the economical aspects of the Spirit. We have a complete revelation concerning the Spirit of God according to the Bible. The Spirit is the resurrected Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Living and Work of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
