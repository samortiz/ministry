   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GUIDANCE: OUTSIDE THE REALM OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to go on from coordination to the matter of guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is so clear that guidance came out of the coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A virgin with a child is certainly not becoming, and Joseph was minded to give Mary up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, while he thought on these things, he had a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some of the translations render this word trance instead of dream.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was not an ordinary dream, but more like a vision or a trance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While Joseph was thinking on these things, he received a vision from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then he was led to take Mary as his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Who brought Mary to Bethlehem?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who brought Mary with the child to Egypt?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who brought them back to the land of Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And who brought the child with the mother to settle in Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Joseph!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of these moves were with Joseph, and all the guidance came through Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also need to see in this picture how submissive Mary was.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She was so much favored with the Lord s mercy, yet she was so humble and submissive to Joseph in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She had the ability to conceive, but she did not receive any leading from the Lord concerning the necessary moves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The leading to move came only to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would be a Joseph to receive the leading, we need to be outside the realm of our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Joseph was minded to put Mary away, and while he thought on these things, he saw something as a vision that had nothing to do with his mentality, something outside the realm of his mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to learn not to analyze so much in the realm of our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we may receive the leading to do something that is absolutely against our natural way of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I really appreciate Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose the angel of the Lord were to come to you and tell you to take Mary, who has a child in her womb, as your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Would you take her?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You would probably tell the Lord that this was against nature and would damage your reputation in society.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then you would tell Mary that you simply cannot take her to be your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If this is the case, you could never be a Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be a Joseph, we need to be delivered from reasoning in the realm of our natural mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the church life, many times when we follow the leading of the Lord, it may seem that we lose our good name, and we may be completely misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we consider all the steps of the Lord s leading with Joseph, we need to realize that not one step was easy for Joseph to take.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Mary had a child in her womb, yet Joseph was asked by the Lord to take her as his future wife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you think this was easy to do?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It appears both Mary and Joseph were poor people, living in a despised district and a small town.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then a decree came that they all must be registered in their home town.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today this may be easy, but in those days it was not so easy, especially for poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the Lord had sovereignly moved in the heart of Caesar to issue such a decree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, it was necessary for Joseph to go to the home town of his relatives, and to take with him his future wife who had a child in her womb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of course, they would ask Joseph who she was and when they were married.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then Joseph would have to tell them that they were not married yet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Just consider the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not one step was easy to take.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then after Jesus was born, another leading from the Lord came that Joseph should take the child and his mother to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No doubt Joseph thought he had traveled enough, but now he must go far away to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to remember that they were poor, and this was a long, hard journey.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Joseph may have wondered how long they were to stay in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord simply told them to go and stay.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They might be there a month, and they might be there a year or longer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is difficult to move when you do not know how long you will stay in the place to which you are moving.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was a real test for Joseph, but he did as he was told.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>ONE STEP AT A TIME</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It may have been only a short time after they arrived in Egypt that the angel appeared to Joseph again and told him to go back to the place from which he had moved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If I were Joseph, I would think the Lord was quite troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He had barely settled in Egypt, and now the Lord was asking him to return to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He did not even say to what city in Israel they should return.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This no doubt was hard for Joseph, but this is the way of the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord tells us one step at a time, never two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When He wants us to take the second step, He will tell us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not ask about the second step, but simply go ahead and take the first.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We want to know not only the second step, but even the steps in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We want to know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord, however, told Joseph only one step at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, Joseph returned to the land of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then, hearing that the son of Herod had come into power, he was afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At that point he received another vision from the Lord that he should go to Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Step by step, Mary received the leading of the Lord through the coordination of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Eventually everything was fulfilled which had been prophesied in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The child was born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He was brought down into Egypt and brought back out of Egypt to the land of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then He settled with His parents at Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All of these steps were necessary for the fulfilling of the Lord s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We all need to learn the lesson of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whether we are a Mary or a Joseph, we need one another.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Mary and Joseph need to work together to bring forth Christ in an adequate and perfect way to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the way of New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The New Testament service in the church life is a service of coordination in every step to fulfill the Lord s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We all need to learn this lesson if we are to be useful in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is really something to see Mary and Joseph working together in such a wonderful coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the reason for the Lord s leading in every step of their move.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We all need to apply this governing principle to our service in the church life.</S>
