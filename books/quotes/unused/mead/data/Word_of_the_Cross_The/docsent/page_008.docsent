   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What has been said above was achieved once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But is it enough for us only to believe once that we have been crucified with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Will this solve the problem once for all?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This leads to the second passage of Scripture: "Let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me" Luke 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This verse points out that the three things we ought to do are actually not three but one thing divided into three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first step is to deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Denying means rejecting, discarding, ignoring, and not acknowledging one's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The meaning of denying the self is simply to disallow the self from being the lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This step is a definite act; it is to believe specifically that "I have already been crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to maintain the work of this step, we must carry out the second step, which is to "daily" take up the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that since we have given the self over to the cross willingly once and have disallowed it from being the lord, we should then continue to deny the self daily.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Denying the self should be "daily" and uninterruptedly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This matter of denying the self cannot be accomplished once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord must give us a daily cross for us to bear daily.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The self is very alert, and Satan who takes advantage of the self is also untiring.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every moment, the self is looking for an opportunity to restore itself and will never let even the slightest chance pass by.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, it is extremely important to bear the cross daily.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is where the believers must be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should "daily" and moment by moment bear the cross the Lord has given us; we should continuously acknowledge that the Lord's cross is our cross and should not give any room to the self or allow it to assume any position.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The third step is to follow the Lord; this is to positively honor the Lord as Lord and to completely obey the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way, the self will have no chance or possibility to develop itself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These three steps are all based and centered upon the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first step of denying the self is on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The second step of taking up the cross is negatively positive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third step of following the Lord is on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The teaching in these two passages should not be separated from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we consider them together and practice them together, we will have the overcoming experience all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, we should allow the Holy Spirit to do His own work and should allow the accomplished work of the cross to be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our common thought is that we are very willing to give our bad, filthy, sinful, and satanic things over to Christ and to have them nailed on the cross with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are very willing to get rid of the evil things in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, our frequent problem is that we think we should keep the good things of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the sight of God, the self is totally corrupted and is deeply affected by the fall of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to God, He cannot heal the life of self, nor can He remedy it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no other way but to crucify it with Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The world is willing to let everything go and is willing even to sacrifice its own money and time, yet it finds it too difficult to deny the self and to crucify it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We always consider that the self is not all bad.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the human viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, the natural man has no intention of retaining only its goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, unconsciously and unwittingly, one keeps the good part of the self and puts the evil part of the self to death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Little do we realize that the self is either totally alive or totally dead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the good part of the self is kept alive, there is no guarantee that the evil part of the self will be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, believers have a serious lesson to learn here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have to be willing to crucify with Christ both the good and the evil parts of their self.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people's natural self is honest by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some are very patient, and some are loving.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is very hard for those people to put all their self to death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Subconsciously, they keep their honesty, patience, and love, and let the other wrong things be crucified with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These believers must be taught by God to realize that they themselves are not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only then will they submit themselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can learn a lesson from Peter on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before he experienced the death and resurrection of Christ and the filling of the Holy Spirit, he truly thought that his love toward the Lord was right.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, was his promise to "die with the Lord" carried out?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Peter's failure was caused by his total trust in himself; he trusted in his own goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet he did not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After all, it is difficult to realize the self.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should trust in God's evaluation of ourselves and should put the self on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we consider God's evaluation of the world, we will be more sure about this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God said, "There is none righteous, not even one" Rom 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To the world, is there really none righteous?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are quite a few righteous persons according to the world's point of view!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The reason God considers none righteous is that all their righteousness is produced by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The self is deeply cultivated by Adam's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"Does the spring, out of the same opening, gush forth sweet and bitter?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>James 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Man thinks that he has what the world approves as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet, "they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, did not submit to the righteousness of God" Rom 10:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The self righteous ones are not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are also sinners destined to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only those who receive the entire person of the Lord Jesus are the righteous ones.</S>
