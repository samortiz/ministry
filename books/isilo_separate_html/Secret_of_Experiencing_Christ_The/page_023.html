A carnation flower is an illustration of this. When a carnation seed is sown, in a sense the carnation blossom is concealed within the seed. But when the plant blossoms, the glory of the carnation flower is manifested. This blossoming is the glorification of the carnation. Similarly, when Christ became a man, God's divine life was concealed in His human shell. When Christ's death broke His human shell, His divine life was released. This releasing of the divine life was the glorification of Christ. At the same time it was also the glorification of the concealed God. Luke 24:26 says, "Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?" This word refers to His resurrection (1 Cor. 15:43a; Acts 3:13a, 15a). Therefore, this verse tells us that through His resurrection Christ entered into glory. Before He ascended to the heavens, Christ had already entered into glory. Christ was glorified in His resurrection, and in His glorification God was also glorified.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Become the Life-giving Spirit That He May<br>Enter into His Believers</H2><P>In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit that He may enter into His believers (1 Cor. 15:45b; John 20:22). While He was in the flesh, He was only able to be among the believers. He had no way to enter into Peter, John, or any of the other disciples. But in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, and on the day of resurrection He came back to the disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them. Becoming the life-giving Spirit to enter into the believers was another great work of Christ in resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HIS ASCENSION</H2><P>Christ accomplished a great deal in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension. However, His work in His ascension has not yet been completed, but will continue until He comes back.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be Made Lord</H2><P>Christ's ascension made Him the Lord (Acts 2:36a). Just as Christ is both God's only begotten Son from eternity past and God's firstborn Son in resurrection, so Christ being the Lord is also in two aspects. From eternity past, Christ is the Lord because He is the very God. But this Christ who is the very God one day put on humanity through incarnation. Then, as we have seen, this humanity was sonized through Christ's resurrection. It was then in Christ's ascension as a man that God made Him the Lord, not only in His divinity but also in His humanity. Now the One who is the Lord of the entire universe is not only God, but also a man, the God-man.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
