The post office will not deliver printed material that is not officially approved to many places. As a result many copies of Issue No. 15 were returned. In order to communicate with various places, we have sent the magazine out as letters instead. This is why many places which subscribed for more than one copy have received only one copy. We can only do the same thing with this issue. Those places which have received only one copy should pass on the news to other brothers and sisters in the same place.</p><p>(2) Since we have to send the magazine out as letters, we have stopped printing the column "The Dynamics of Service" in order to reduce the number of pages.</p><p>(3) We have sent copies of the magazine to all those who have subscribed to it. If you have not received a copy, it is either because the post office has refused to forward printed material or because it has been delayed in the mail. At critical times these things can happen all the time. If you have not received anything for a long time, please inform us. We will pay more postage and send a copy to you as a letter.</p><p>(4) We thank the Lord for the relief work to the saints in need. His grace is abundant! According to our knowledge, Kuei-yang, Wuhan, Szechuan, and Chungshan have no more needs. We are still paying attention to areas around Hunan. There are more needs in areas around north Kiangsu. It is quite difficult to forward funds by mail. We can only look to the Lord to open a way. In supplying the needs of the saints, we are constantly afraid of neglecting the ones who are really in need. Those who are looking to the Lord with a pure heart often do not say anything concerning their needs. I hope that those who know their real need will inform the responsible brothers in their locality, lest we owe them something.</p><p>(5) Rumors and one-sided reports should not be taken lightly. We hope that the brothers and sisters in the Lord would either carefully screen letters that spread reports about the churches or ignore them altogether. Believing in these reports lightly only provides an opening for attacks. However, if anyone is wrong or if any church has any weakness, we should speak the truth in love (Eph. 4:15). Our exhortations should be in Christ (Phil. 2:1). Evil-intentioned criticism, inaccurate reports, and shady, anonymous letters are not Christian acts. We cannot act as the unbelievers do. Although it is not an easy thing to speak the truth, love would rather see ourselves suffering hurt in order to save ourselves from misunderstandings.</p><p>(6) When the brothers and sisters quote from the book Rethinking Our Work, they should do so because the point quoted is according to Scripture. This is why we act according to what it says, and only when we act this way will we receive the benefit. If one says that he does this or that because the book says so, others will misunderstand that we consider this book to be more important than the Bible. We have no intention of doing this, and we dare not uplift any book more than the authority of the Bible. We should be careful in our words.</p><p>(7) Some brothers and sisters say that they have received the calling to serve the Lord full-time. We should rejoice and thank the Lord for this. Some co-workers do not know these ones well, and therefore cannot recommend them. This does not mean that these called ones are not qualified to work for the Lord. I wish all the young brothers and sisters who are called by the Lord would be like Henry Moore in England. Mr. Moody neglected him in the beginning because he did not know him. However, when Mr. Moody heard his preaching, he was driven to tears. This caused a change in Mr. Moody's preaching from that point on. Is this vindication not better than many self-recommending commendations? If a calling is genuine and the timing is right, what does one have to fear? If the calling is not clear, one should wait and examine even when there is sympathy and encouragement on all sides. This is something that we should not handle in a light way.</p><p>Ruth Lee in Shanghai<br />April 11, 1939</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_097.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_099.html">Next</a> </body></html>
