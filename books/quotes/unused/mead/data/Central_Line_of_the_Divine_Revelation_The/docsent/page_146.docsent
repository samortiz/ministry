   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE SUBJECTIVE SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ progresses in the subjective sanctification of the saints Rom 6:19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After our regeneration, we need to be sanctified subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Subjective sanctification is the dispensing of the holy nature of God into the saints, separating the saints unto God by the saturation of God's holy nature into the saints' being 2 Pet 1:4; 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we were regenerated, a great change occurred in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, at that time we were still common and worldly, both within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The applying of the blood of Christ to separate us from the world Heb 13:12 is an outward, positional matter, not a dispositional matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We still need a dispositional sanctification by the inner life, by the indwelling Spirit, by the very God who is within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every day the divine life as the Holy Spirit, who is God Himself, is operating, moving, working, saturating, and anointing us little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we may be much holier than we were when we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we were regenerated, we might have enjoyed certain worldly entertainments, but today we would not do those things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we do those things, we do not feel right in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because we are being sanctified subjectively, we prefer to meet with the saints to enjoy and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need sanctification to follow our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regeneration is a beginning, a renewing, but sanctification is a continuation, a constant renewing day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By such a sanctification we will not be fashioned according to this age but will be transformed by the renewing of our mind Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both regeneration and sanctification are a dispensing of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's intention is to work Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He does this little by little, saturating us vertically and permeating us horizontally in every part of our being until our body is redeemed Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The redemption of our body is the transfiguration of our body Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is to have our entire being saturated and permeated with the glorious element of the divine God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we are saturated to this degree, we will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All this is the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, from regeneration to glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the accomplishment and experience of God's full redemption and salvation in Christ.</S>
