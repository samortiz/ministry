We see the Lord's own hand helping us in everything. Every evening nine people pray together in one accord. In my work over the years, I have never seen such prayer meetings. The Lord is really among us. We believe the Lord is going to do greater things than this. There are about twenty people in every Lord's Day meeting. Eight or nine break the bread together. We feel that the condition of every meeting is very good. We should really thank the Lord for this. We see that the door in western Hunan has been opened. According to Brother Chang's letter, the believers in Yuan-Jiang have already seen the light of the truth of the church. Yi-Yang also has some of God's faithful children standing firmly for the Lord's truth. I ask the Lord to give me the power and physical strength of an apostle to visit all the larger cities in the province of Hunan in this year. It is true that when man reaches his end, God begins. I really see that I am empty and useless. If God did not put the resurrection power in humble, useless vessels, we could never see His glory. I ask again and again that the brothers and sisters pray for me much. The brothers have formed a partnership to open a teahouse. All the pots and cups have John 4:13-14 on them: "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever." We ask God to give us many opportunities to preach the gospel. Please do not forget to pray for the Living Water Teahouse. Peace in the Lord! Greet all the brothers and sisters in Shanghai. Please greet Brother Chang Kwang-rong, Sister Miao, and Sister Tso for me. How have Brother Ho Deh-gen and Brother Lin Dao-tze been? I remember them often.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Han Fu-sheng<br />February 7</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Tsi-yi:</p><p>The Living Water Teahouse was opened on March 2. We began to preach the gospel on the fourth. Today is the fourth day of the meetings. Many people come to hear the gospel. It rained last night and snowed in the morning, so the meeting was somewhat affected. Please pray for us much. The business side of the Living Water Teahouse is not bad. More than one hundred people come there to drink tea every day. Sometimes there are more than two hundred. However, we must sell dim sum before we can break even. We have not found anyone to make the dim sum, so for now we are only selling tea.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Fu-sheng<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Hope<br />for People to Go to Yaoan County,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>Miss Ruth Lee:</p><p>Ten years have flown by since we parted in Nanking. I have been so busy with my business and personal affairs that I have not been able to send you any news. I am very sorry! Yesterday, I received the second issue of The Open Door and received much benefit from reading it. I was also very happy to find how those who walk together with us in the way were doing. It comforted me very much. I was very happy to find that those in the way were willing to come thousands of miles to work for the Lord in Yunnan. The standard of living here is much lower. It only costs two dollars for a person to eat for a month. Even with miscellaneous expenses, a person does not need to spend more than four dollars a month. Even if a couple has three or four children, their monthly expenses would not be more than twenty dollars (two hundred old Yunnan dollars). They would be living very comfortably. If any in the way have the Lord's leading and want to come here to preach the gospel, I would welcome them very much and would be willing to do my best to help them. I have not had the opportunity to write directly to the workers in K'un-ming and in southern Yunnan. I only have their news from The Open Door. In the future please send me a copy of anything you publish. Peace to you in body and spirit!</p><p>The little slave in the Lord,<br />Chiang Shun-ching<br />February 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(When Mr. Chiang was in Nanking, he often came to Mr. Kao Shi-ju's house and prayed with us. I really thank the Lord that I received this letter today! I hope the brothers and sisters who have been called to work in the interior of Yunnan will contact Mr. Chiang directly. It would be a great benefit to have Mr. Chiang as a guide&mdash;Editor.)</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_093.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_095.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 94</div><br></body></html>
