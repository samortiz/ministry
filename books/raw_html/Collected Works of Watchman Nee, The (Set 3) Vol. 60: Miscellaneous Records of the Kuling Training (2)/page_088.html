<h2 class="head3">The Function of the Law</h2><p>Some new believers may ask, "Since the law is a bondage to man, why did God give this law to man in the first place?" First, we have to realize that the law is not God's original thought; it was added later. It was instituted to meet certain needs, to deal with certain conditions. Galatians 3 expounds the function of the law in a very clear way. Verse 17 says, "A covenant previously ratified by God, the law, having come four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul so as to make the promise of none effect." Verse 19 says, "Why then the law? It was added because of the transgressions until the seed should come to whom the promise was made." Verse 21 says, "Is then the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of law." Verse 25 says, "But since faith has come, we are no longer under a child-conductor." These verses tell us the reason God gave the law in the Old Testament.</p><p>According to Galatians, four hundred and thirty years before God gave the law, He promised Abraham that he would be justified by faith and that through him all the nations of the earth would be blessed. Abraham is the father of faith. This means that his descendants are saved through faith. God's promise is His grace. The gospel was not yet announced, but there already was the promise. Justification by faith is something that God promised at the beginning. This shows that the law is not in God's original thought; grace is in God's original thought. In order for man to receive grace, however, he must realize his need. In order for man to receive salvation, he must first commit transgressions. If a man does not have a need, he will not receive grace. If a man has never transgressed, he will not want to be saved. In God's eyes, man is altogether a sinner, but man does not know that he is a sinner. This is the reason he does not come to God to receive grace. He has to commit some sins before he knows that he is a sinner and before he will come to God for grace. A man knows his sin through the law. When the law comes, transgression follows. Paul showed us that before he saw God's law about not coveting, he did not know covetousness. He was covetous, but he did not know that it was a sin. When God's law said, "You shall not covet," he knew that covetousness was a sin (Rom. 7:7-8). God says, "You shall not covet." If a man covets, he has transgressed against the law and sinned. This shows that the function of the law is to expose man's sin. Moses forbade the Israelites from worshipping any images. Before this time, the Israelites could have worshipped a thousand images and would not have known that it was sin. When Moses came down from the mountain with the tablets of stone, however, they realized it was sin to worship the calf.</p><p>Four hundred and thirty years before God gave the law, He preached the gospel to Abraham. His covenant with Abraham was that he would be justified by faith. Once God established this covenant, a law instituted four hundred and thirty years later could not annul it. Galatians 3:15 says, "Brothers, I speak according to man, though it is a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one nullifies it or makes additions to it." Once a covenant is established, it is impossible to add any more conditions to it or to delete anything from it. Some may ask: "Since God had established a covenant with Abraham, why did He give man the law four hundred and thirty years later? What was the purpose behind God's giving of the law?" In verse 19 Paul speaks of the function of the law: "It was added because of the transgressions." The law was added because of the transgressions. Once the law was added, there was transgression. Romans 4:15 says, "Where there is no law, neither is there transgression," and 5:20 says, "And the law entered in alongside that the offense might abound." From Adam to Moses, sin was in the world, but man did not know about his sins because the law was not made manifest. Man's sins were manifested as transgressions only after the law was instituted. Man was sinful, but he was unable to receive God's grace because he did not know his condition. God gave the law so that man would fall into transgressions and know his true condition, thus humbling himself to accept grace. God gave the law so that His covenant would become effective, so that man would know that he is a sinner, and so that he would come to God to receive grace.</p><p>The law lies in waiting for the Lord Jesus to come. Matthew 11:13 says, "For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John." The function of the law is to fulfill the promise. God's goal is grace, while the law is merely the means. Man must go through the law before he can be ushered into grace. Does this mean that the law was against God's grace? Of course not. Paul said, "But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was to be revealed. So then the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ" (Gal. 3:23-24). The law is God's servant; it leads us to Christ. Since we have touched Christ, we are no longer under the child-conductor. This means that we are no longer under the law. In the final analysis, God has not put us under the law. We are brought to Christ through the law, and from that point onward, we no longer follow the law. The law does not frustrate us. Before man is brought to Christ, the more he keeps the law the less he can go on. In the end he has to come to Christ. In this way the law fulfills grace. This is the function of the law.</p>
