   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we not only worship You as the speaking God, but even more we worship You that You are the Word and this Word is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the reality of this Spirit enters into us to be our element, it makes us God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, we thank You that You became man in order to make man God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is truly an economy incomprehensible to the angels and to men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the previous chapter we saw the first One in the mystery the Spirit, who is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This God who is the Spirit has passed through a number of processes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, He became flesh John 1:14 ; then He became the life-giving Spirit, that is, the Spirit of life 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then this Spirit became the compound Spirit as the anointing ointment Exo 30:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is also the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:17-18 , the Spirit John 7:38-39; Rev 22:17 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19b , the Spirit of reality John 14:17; 1 John 5:6b , the Spirit in the Word John 6:63; Eph 6:17-18a , the mantle Spirit poured upon the believers, that is, the Spirit of power Acts 2:18, 33; Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:12b-15 , and finally, the seven Spirits Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This processed God is one yet three, three yet one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This three-one and one-three God became flesh and then became the Spirit, that is, the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is what the Bible clearly reveals to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a God passed through these processes, first that He might make God man, and ultimately that He might make man God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the beginning of the Bible, God created the heavens and the earth and man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For four thousand years after He created man, through the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, besides presenting some prophecies and types, nearly nothing was done as far as the accomplishment of His eternal economy is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was not until the New Testament that He came out to do something that is incomprehensible to men; that is, He was born into the womb of a virgin, remained there for nine months, and then was brought forth from the virgin's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was born with the flesh, with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was God, yet He was born to be a human child and was laid in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was from that point that He began to pass through the processes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This God became a God-man, passing through thirty-three and a half years of human living, and then passing through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, this God-man produced tens of thousands of God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter, John, James, and Paul were included.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the believers in Christ also are included.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then after He ascended into the heavens, He poured Himself down like heavy rain to be the mantle Spirit for Peter and his company to put on as the Spirit of power to them for the carrying out of the Lord's great work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, three thousand and then five thousand were saved to become the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only so, this Spirit also became the Spirit of Jesus Christ with the bountiful supply to enable those who became the church to live a God-man life to live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All these accomplishments of God depend on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, there is a saying that a single hand cannot produce a clapping sound.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there is only God the Spirit, there is still no way to accomplish all the matters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He needs another spirit to "clap" together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This other spirit is the spirit of the regenerated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When God created man, He made preparation for this spirit of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are two crucial points concerning God's creating of man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First, God created man in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What He created was man, but what came out was in God's likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness" Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God created man, yet what came out was not according to mankind but according to God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God created all things after their own kind, but He created man not according to mankind but according to God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This laid a foundation for man so that he could become God in life and nature, but without any share in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The second crucial point in God's creation of man was that God created a spirit in man Gen 2:7; Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since God is Spirit, if there were no spirit in man, there would be no way for man to contact this God who is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God had only created man after God's kind, having God's likeness yet not having an organ to contact and receive Him, God's heart's desire would have had no way to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, God created man with a spirit to enable man to contact and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all know that in the universe, the devil and the demons are evil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible uses the serpent to signify the devil and the scorpions to signify the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Concerning the angels, although they are not evil, they are merely serving spirits Heb 1:14 ; hence, they are insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the universe, only man, who has a spirit, is important.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Zechariah 12:1 says, "...Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we have the three great keys in the universe: the heavens, the earth, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God created the heavens, the earth, man, and especially a spirit for man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is God's preparation within man for His economy.</S>
