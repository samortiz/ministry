   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Do you remember what the Bible says about the sixth to ninth hours?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sun's light failed Luke 23:44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Jews could mock Him, and the Gentiles could chastise and shame Him, but the sun was beyond the Jews' control.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Gentiles did not have the authority to manipulate the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man could clamor and trumpet, but the earthquake was not something that Pilate could summon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why was the sky darkened?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These phenomena happened because God Himself had come to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was not something done by man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If it had been done by man, would God have added to His Son's pain when He was hanging on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Would God not have sent twelve companies of angels to come and rescue Him?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such would indeed have happened had it not been for the redemption for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We thank and praise God that His Son came to redeem us from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was why He said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No believer throughout the past two thousand years has ever said these terrible words when they died.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For two thousand years, whether the believers died in peace or in woe, they were more bold than He was.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why was the Son of God rejected there by God?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If it had merely been man's hand and man's crucifixion, that would have been the time He needed God's presence even more.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When man plotted to persecute and kill Him, God should have manifested His presence more.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That was the most crucial moment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God should have been with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why did God leave Him instead?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was solely because the Son of God had become sin and had borne the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That was the reason He cried, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God had forsaken Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We who have believed in the work of redemption know that the work of the cross was for Him to be judged by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The cross of the Lord shows us how evil sin is and how much of a price God has paid for the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Besides Isaiah 53, another clear testimony of the Scripture can be found.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Romans 3:25, God set forth Christ "as a propitiation place."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This also shows clearly that the work was done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Deuteronomy 21:23 tells us that he who is hanged on a tree is accursed of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord was hanging on the cross, He was not accursed of man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, He was accursed of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That is why He can deliver us from the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First John 4:10 says that God loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation concerning our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was God who sent His Son to be a propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was not man who crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second Corinthians 5:21 also says, "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was something that God did.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The cross is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was God who sent the Lord Jesus to pass through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Acts 2:23 mentions both the aspect of God and the aspect of man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus was killed by the Jews through the hand of lawless men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, such a death was according to the determined counsel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This shows us that everything was done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have sin, and sin can only be taken care of by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason, God came to the world to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While He was a man, He was indeed righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this righteousness was not imputed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was the death of the Lord Jesus that delivered us from the curse of the law Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He did not deliver us from sin while He was living, but when He died.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On the cross, it was God who crucified Him, rather than man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Man's hand is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was God who took the opportunity to make manifest man's sin.</S>
