   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE THREE PARTICULAR CAPACITIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:2-3, 5-7; John 1:3; Eph 4:18-19</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to see the three particular capacities of the divine life: the fellowship of life, the light of life, and the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every life has a nature, and in the nature of every life there are particular capacities, or abilities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A dog has the capacity, the ability, to bark.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ability to bark is in the nature of the dog.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As human beings we can speak, hear, see, and understand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are some of the innate capacities of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These capacities are in the nature of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The divine life also has many capacities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These capacities are the abilities which exist in the nature of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Of these many capacities, the fellowship of life, the light of life, and the sense of life are very particular and basic.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fellowship of life and the light of life are covered in the writings of John 1 John 1:3, 5; John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First John 1:1-2 says, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands handled concerning the Word of life; and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Word of life in verse 1 is the Son of God, who is the eternal life in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostles ministered the eternal life to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This eternal life is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The believers then received this life and were brought into the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Fellowship comes with the divine life because fellowship is one of the capacities in the nature of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From the time that we believed into the Lord Jesus and were regenerated, the divine life entered into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This divine life is God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Within this divine life is a capacity called fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This fellowship is both in a vertical direction, from God to us, and in a horizontal direction, from believer to believer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fellowship of life is one of the first capacities of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After receiving Christ and being regenerated, a believer likes to see other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever a Christian finds other Christians, he is happy to talk with them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This experience is an example of the capacity of fellowship in the divine life.</S>
