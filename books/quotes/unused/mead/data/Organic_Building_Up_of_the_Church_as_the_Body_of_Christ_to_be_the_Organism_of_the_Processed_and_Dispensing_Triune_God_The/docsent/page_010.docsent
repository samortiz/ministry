   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Increase of God in the Growth of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>within the Members of the Organic Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is increasing, and God is increasing in the growth of life within the members of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Colossians 2:19 says, Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, by means of the joints and bands being supplied and knit together, grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To grow is a matter of life, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the Body of Christ, the church should not be deprived of Christ, who is the embodiment of God Col 2:9 as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By holding Christ, the Head, the church grows with the growth of God, with the increase of God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Multiplication of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>in the Fruit-bearing by the Branches of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>the True Vine in the Universe,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>as the Organism of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The organic increase of the church is the multiplication of Christ in the fruit-bearing by the branches of Christ, the true vine in the universe, as the organism of the Triune God John 15:1, 5, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the Christians are the duplication and the multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We, as the many grains, are a multiplication of Christ, as the one grain, which fell into the earth to die John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This multiplication of Christ is in the fruit-bearing by the branches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As His branches, we must go forth to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus said that He appointed us to go forth to bear fruit and that our fruit should remain John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fruit borne by us is the multiplication of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The vine tree with all its branches and all its fruit is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Triune God in His organism is the focus of chapters fourteen through sixteen of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This organism is the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As branches of this divine organism, we have to live an increasing life, which is a fruit-bearing life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we say that we enjoy Christ and abide in Christ according to John 15, we must be bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are not bearing fruit and we say that we are abiding in Christ, we are deceiving ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genuine abiding in Christ will cause us to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our enjoyment is vain if we are not bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are branches, and the duty and responsibility of the branches is fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fruit borne by the branches is the multiplication and the duplication of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The increase of the vine tree is the increase of Christ, and the increase of Christ is the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Growth of the Organic Body of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>with the Divine Life as the Growing Element,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>for the Organic Building Up of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The organic increase of the church is the growth of the organic Body of Christ, with the divine life as the growing element, for the organic building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Body of Christ, there are two categories of members: the joints and each one part.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The joints and the parts can be compared to the two categories of materials in a building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The steel beams of this big meeting hall are joined closely together into a steel frame.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the stones and wood of this building are put together, knit together, by being interwoven.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s building, the Body of Christ, needs to be joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply and knit together through the operation in measure of each one part.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The joints are equal to the gifts mentioned in Ephesians 4:11: And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are many joints in a human body, and a healthy body needs the proper function of all its joints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a person s fingers did not have joints, his hand could not function properly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A simple task, such as picking up a fork to eat, would be quite awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The joints are all necessary so that a person s body can operate normally.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church, as the Body of Christ, also needs the proper function of all the joints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the church we need many joints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a local church has only two or three joints of supply, and these joints are only the elders, that is a poor local church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A proper church will be full of joints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In every church there should be many joints providing the rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The rich supply that the joints supply to the Body is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ephesians 4:16 says, Out from whom all the Body, joined closely together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply, and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This verse speaks of the rich supply.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The use of the definite article the indicates that there is a particular supply of Christ that each joint has for the benefit of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The second category of members in the Body is each one part.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a person s physical body, there are many parts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The joints do not constitute the whole body, so there is the need for all the parts to match and complement the joints.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As the joints in the Body of Christ are supplying, the parts should all be operating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thank the Lord that every member is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why we all need to endeavor to pick up the God-ordained way of serving which brings all the members of the Body of Christ into function.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is such a contrast to our old way, which annulled the function of most of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every local church should be full of joints supplying and parts operating.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is accomplished by the intrinsic growth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we are growing in the divine life, in the divine Trinity, we will not be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will be very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All of us will be active, living members of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When the Body of Christ is functioning properly through the active participation of the joints and each one part, all the Body...causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is quite marvelous that all the Body causes the Body to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Greek, the word unto means with a view to, for the purpose of, or resulting in. The growth of the Body results in the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the intrinsic growth of the church for the church s organic increase, issuing in the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
