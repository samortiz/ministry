   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SENT ONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every one of you can be all these four kinds of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not think this is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In your religious concept, an apostle might mean a prominent leader, but the Greek meaning of the word is sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If, for example, I send you to get my briefcase, you are my apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 20:19 and 21, "Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The disciples therefore rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then Jesus said to them again, Peace be to you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This passage says the disciples not the apostles were assembled together, rejoiced when they saw the Lord, and were told by the Lord, "I send you."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus was the Father's sent One, coming to us as the Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was the first New Testament Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we are His sent ones, going to others as apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How did the Father send the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He sent Him by going with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are constrained by the Lord, after praying, to say a word for Him to your mother, the Lord would say to you, "I send you as the Father sent Me. When you go to your mother, I shall be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Go and express Me, as I expressed the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Express Me and speak for Me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To the Lord, then, you are a sent one; to your mother, you are an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may feel burdened, after contacting the Lord through prayer, to go to your relatives, or classmates, or neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Go to them with Him and to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>NORMAL</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope I have persuaded you that we can all be these gifted ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are not a special class.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you have not been perfected up to this standard, you are abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every normal Christian must be one sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not say that you are still a student and therefore cannot be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God needs teenage prophets!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You can be sent to your classmates by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then care for the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Teach them about the three wills in the universe and about God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If all of you are like this, a revival will spread throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need of a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no need for you to be ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have already been ordained and chosen to be a sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you care about this?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If so, go to the Lord and say, "Lord, I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I present myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Send me."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord will say, "I have already sent you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Go!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You must go to your relatives, friends, classmates, or even people you encounter on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You must speak persuasively to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Preach the gospel and convince them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>HOW TO BE PERFECTED</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You not only can but you also must be an apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd and teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this to come about you must read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Acts 6:7 says, "And the word of God increased."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For the Word of God to grow and multiply there must be a period of learning, experiencing, and being dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not an overnight matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It requires the work of the leading apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What they do you also need to do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They take the lead, setting up the pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You follow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If they speak of God's economy, that is what you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You say what they say, and do what they do.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are the lead sheep in the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If they turn right, the rest of you turn right.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They do not do one thing and have you do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You cannot speak the Word if you do not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You will be making a fool of yourself if you try to help others and you do not even know where Genesis is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God's way is the way of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is not a miraculous or mushrooming growth based on gimmicks.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Acts 6:4 says, "We will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God's way is by life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Day by day read the Word and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Match whatever you read by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Pray in order to digest the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then it will get into you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Once this happens, the Word becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>With the Spirit, you have life, understanding, and utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then you can be sent.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The matter of being a gifted one is wholly wrapped up with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even if you are young, come to the Word regularly and pray-read it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Be mingled with the divine Word and the life-giving Spirit day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you do this, within a very few years you will be ready to be sent and to be God's spokesman, speaking for Him and speaking Him forth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You will preach the gospel and shepherd new ones, teaching them how to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This was how the church life was in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Today we have a degraded situation, full of deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must come back and let the Lord give us a new beginning.</S>
