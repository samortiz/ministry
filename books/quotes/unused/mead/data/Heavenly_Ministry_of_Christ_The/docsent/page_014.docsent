   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DISTRACTED BY PROPHECY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was first saved, I loved the Lord and His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a young man, I loved the Bible and made up my mind I would come to understand every verse of it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I would spend my whole life on this!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now I have learned that the Bible is too profound for me ever to fully grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the beginning I thought I was progressing quite well in my efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would hunt for books on the Bible and would go wherever the Bible was taught.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually I was caught by the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I started going to their meetings, they were preaching on the seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In all my years in Christianity, from the time I was born, I had never heard of these seventy weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was fascinated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later on, I heard about ten toes, four beasts, and ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I began to study these strange, yet very scriptural subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the years I spent among the Brethren I do not recall ever hearing a message on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day I realized how poor my condition was.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I had learned all about the prophecies, but I was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In my disappointment I turned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord gave me a turn away from the ten toes, the ten horns, the four beasts, and the seventy weeks!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I turned to Christ, to the Spirit, to life, and to the church!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since 1932 my attention has been focused on these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In message after message these are the subjects you hear in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I must warn you young people not to be distracted from these to other things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may be approached by some who will ask you what the meaning is of the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not know, they will make you feel your knowledge of the Bible is too restricted, that you know only about Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Young people are eager for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are distracted by prophecy, you will not hold the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not mean that you should not study other things in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should study them, but you must see that all these other things are minor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The major things in the Bible are Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>DISTRACTED BY DOCTRINES</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is easy to be distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I know of some who have been distracted to keeping the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead of caring for Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, the divine life, and the church, they talk about the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others are distracted about the way of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You may be asked by some preacher what kind of baptism the church practices: sprinkling or immersion, in what name, forwards or backwards, how many times.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How would you answer?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Will you be distracted?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A sister who attended a Lord s table meeting in Los Angeles afterwards wrote me a letter objecting to our use of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How would you have answered her?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I have spent quite some time studying whether wine or grape juice should be used for the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is something to be said on both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You cannot make a firm decision.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is the use, then, of arguing about such matters?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Head coverings for the sisters is another question you may well be asked about.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you say you believe in head coverings, they may go on to ask what color, what shape, and what size.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Turn away from all these distracting considerations!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My word to you is: hold the Head!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christianity is in thousands of divisions because of these distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When any such questions are presented to you, you can inwardly pray: Lord, have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Help me to hold You as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I don t want to be ensnared by these distracting questions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I would hold the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When Paul wrote of not holding the Head in Colossians 2:19, he was referring to those who were distracting the church in Colossae with Judaism, Greek philosophy, and Gnosticism.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is only when you hold the Head that you are kept from such distractions and can correspond to the ministry of Christ in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As long as you hold the Head, you will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The reason so few Christians correspond to Christ s heavenly ministry is that they have been distracted from holding the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Ephesians 4:14 says, That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The wind that carries the babes about is teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not a wind of heresy, but even proper, scriptural doctrine, which can carry us away away from Christ, the Head, and away from the church, the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This wind is part of Satan s system to deceive the believers and lure them from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How important it is to hold the Head and not allow any doctrine, however biblical, to distract us from Him!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>GIVING THE LORD GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As we hold the Head, we shall grow up into Him Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Gradually we shall see that, in one thing after another, we are not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As we see, we can pray, Lord, take over.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this matter I give You the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the practical growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We belong to Christ, but in many things we are not in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In those things He has no ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In our way of talking, He may have no ground.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As we hold the Head, we shall realize that our speaking is not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we ask the Lord to take over in this area, we shall grow in life regarding our talking.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many Christians love the Lord, but He does not have the ground in them because they are not holding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When they hold Him, the Spirit within may speak to them about their clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If they say, Lord, I give You the ground to deal with my way of dressing, then He will come in and take over.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The same may be true of the way a brother treats his wife or of a sister s attitude toward her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They may love the Lord, but in their marital relationship they will not give Him one inch.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If they hold the Head, the Spirit within will tell them that Christ has no ground in their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As they open and give the Lord the ground, He will occupy them more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To thus give ground to the Lord in your daily life is the proper way to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You do not grow by gathering scriptural knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>To grow in life is to let the Lord take over in every practical matter.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As you do this in matter after matter, attitude after attitude, you will grow in those particular areas.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord will gradually fill you and possess your whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then you will mature.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>By this growth in life your function will emerge, and the Body will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is a deeper and finer correspondence to the Lord s heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is by this means that the churches are being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>May we all see that in God s economy nothing counts but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have been transferred into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He is our portion, our enjoyment, and our life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He is to be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Such a vision will preserve us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We shall not allow any doctrine to distract us; doctrines are like wild beasts waiting to devour us!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must hold the Head with fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Then the Spirit day after day will keep speaking to us: In this thing you still keep the ground for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In that other thing you have never given in to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In this area you have not given the Lord an inch of ground.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In that area you are still holding out.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we are holding the Head, we shall respond, Lord, in this I give You the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In that I open for You to take over.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Such a response results in our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Christ increases in us by His being able to take more ground.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Then our function will come forth, and the Body will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This vital correspondence to the Lord s heavenly ministry is finer than the outward move in life to bring people into God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>To correspond to Him in this deeper way makes possible the building up of His Body.</S>
