   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Satan's Work on Man's Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 12:10 says, "The accuser of our brothers...who accuses them before our God day and night."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This shows us that part of Satan's work is to accuse us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This work is carried out in man's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As soon as a person is saved, his conscience is quickened, and he begins to know sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Satan knows this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He knows that the Holy Spirit touches the conscience of God's children concerning sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He knows that He guides them into confession and prayer for forgiveness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consequently, Satan steps in to counterfeit the Holy Spirit's work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He accuses man in his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such an attack is found frequently among God's children, and it causes much havoc.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many children of God cannot differentiate between the Holy Spirit's reproach and Satan's accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, they are hesitant to withstand anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This gives Satan further ground to exercise his accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many children of God could have been very useful in the hands of God, but their conscience has been weakened to the uttermost by Satan's attack.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are bombarded constantly with the accusation and feeling that they have sinned in this and that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are unable to stand up before God or before men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, they become spiritually handicapped for the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is true that we should pay attention to the reproach of the Holy Spirit once we become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we also need to withstand Satan's accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to pay attention to the difference between the Holy Spirit's reproach and Satan's accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many so-called reproaches are counterfeits; they are, in fact, Satan's accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Difference between Satan's Accusation</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and the Holy Spirit's Reproach</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the difference between Satan's accusation and the Holy Spirit's reproach?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to distinguish between them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, all reproaches from the Holy Spirit begin with a small feeling from within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This inner feeling becomes stronger and stronger and convicts us of our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan's accusation, however, is a continual nagging within.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The reproach of the Holy Spirit grows stronger and stronger as time goes on; the accusation of Satan is the same from beginning to end. As time passes, the inner sense of the Spirit ascends by degree; but the accusation of Satan is a constant, muddled nagging that stays the same from beginning to end.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, each time we yield to the rebuke of the Spirit, we find the power of sin diminishing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Each rebuke of the Spirit diminishes the power of sin a little.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, any rebuke from the Spirit weakens the power of sin; it results in a diminishing of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not the case with Satan's accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every time he accuses us, we find the power of sin to be just as great as before.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Third, the reproach of the Holy Spirit brings us to the Lord, whereas Satan's accusation brings us disappointment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we are reproved by the Holy Spirit, the more we are strengthened within to deal with our problem before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But Satan's accusation brings about despair and resignation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reproach of the Holy Spirit causes us to come before the Lord and to rely on Him; Satan's accusation causes us to turn back to ourselves and to be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Fourth, if it is the reproach of the Holy Spirit, confession before the Lord will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This confession will result in at least peace, if not joy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There may or may not be joy, but there is always peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan's accusation, however, is totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no joy and no peace, even after one confesses his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is like coming out of a major illness or going through a theatrical performance nothing remains after the act is over.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The reproach of the Holy Spirit has a result peace, if not joy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, Satan's accusation leads us nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Fifth, the reproach of the Holy Spirit reminds us of the blood of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With Satan's accusation, there is always the Satan-injected thought: "There is not much use.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps the Lord will not forgive you."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This thought will be there even when we know that we have the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In other words, the reproach of the Holy Spirit leads to faith in the Lord's blood, while Satan's accusation causes us to lose our faith in the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a certain feeling comes, simply check whether we are reminded of the blood as a result of this feeling or whether we have been distanced from the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This will tell us whether the feeling is a reproach of the Holy Spirit or an accusation from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sixth, the result of the reproach of the Holy Spirit is power from God; one will rise up on his feet and run faster.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He will go on with renewed zeal, cast aside his trust in himself, and have more faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, the result of Satan's accusation is the debilitation of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The conscience of such ones is smitten before God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They have no faith in themselves, and they have no faith in God either.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is true that the reproach of the Holy Spirit takes away our strength and our trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But at the same time it causes us to have more faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Satan's accusation is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It takes away our confidence in ourselves as well as our faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The result is that we become a debilitated person.</S>
