They are compiled from notes of Weigh Kwang-hsi and his wife, Mrs. Weigh Lin Yi-tian. Most of the messages were spoken by Watchman Nee. Some of them were spoken by Watchman Nee and Witness Lee together.</p><p>These two volumes have been divided into two sections. The first section contains the record of five times of fellowship with co-workers in Canton in August of 1949 and one time of fellowship with co-workers in Hong Kong on November 21, 1949. These records are contained in chapters one through six.</p><p>The second section covers the period between February 2 and March 11, 1950. Watchman Nee and Witness Lee were both in Hong Kong during that time conducting service meetings, conferences, and private fellowships together. The record of their sharing is contained in chapters seven through forty-five. Watchman Nee arrived in Hong Kong in January of 1950, and returned to China on March 12. Witness Lee arrived in Hong Kong on February 16 and left on April 1 for Taiwan. During their stay, these two brothers rendered much help to the church in Hong Kong. Volumes 61 and 62 of The Collected Works only include the record of the meetings in which Watchman Nee attended and spoke. Concerning this period of time, Brother K. H. Weigh remarked, "In the past it had been a rare occurrence for these two brothers to visit the same church at the same time. Their ministry issued in a great revival in the church in Hong Kong. Previously there had been about three hundred in the meetings. As a result of the revival the number increased to between two and three thousand. There was a special blessing upon the church in Hong Kong" (Vol. 26 of The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, p. 449).</p><p>The content of these meetings includes handing over oneself for the preaching of the gospel, release from the bondage of money, the whole Body rising up to serve, spiritual ministry, and arrangements concerning various aspects of church service. Every chapter is weighty in content and fresh in revelation.</p><p>Since the messages in these two volumes were released at a time when Watchman Nee's ministry was in its mature stage, we have named these two volumes "Mature Leadings in the Lord's Recovery." They form the final volumes in this series of The Collected Works of Watchman Nee.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
