We must realize, though, that Satan always tries to copy what God is doing. It is regrettable that God's children do not go out to visit people. Instead, they may stay at home on Saturday to watch television and talk on the phone, or they may go shopping. After ten years, many Christians may not have brought one person to the Lord. Is this the Lord's will? We are the branches of the vine. The Lord's will is for all the branches to bear fruit. In John 15:16 the Lord said clearly, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain." He warned us that as the branches, we will be cut off if we do not bear fruit (John 15:2, 5-6). This is not to perish but to lose the very enjoyment of the rich vine. If we mean business with the Lord, our enjoyment of the Lord will bring forth fruit. However, where is the fruit today? We need to come back to the Word to read what the Lord's will is concerning this matter. If you read what the Lord's will is, you will be one who goes out to visit people.</P><P>Ephesians 5:18 says, "And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit." Every worldly thing that satisfies us is like wine. To go shopping to buy unnecessary things is wine. We should not be drunk with wine but be filled in our spirit with the dispensing Triune God. He is dispensing and we are drinking. When we are filled in our spirit with the dispensing Triune God, we speak to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, and we are full of thanks and praises (vv. 19-20). Many have found out that when they went out to knock on people's doors and baptized someone, they were filled in this way.</P><P>Verse 21 says, "Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ." Christ as our Savior is the Head. Since He is the Head, we must learn to be subject to one another. Do not be the head over others. If we all take Christ as our Head and subject ourselves to Him, we will also subject ourselves to one another. The young ones should subject themselves to the older ones, and the older ones to the young ones. The older ones may feel superior and feel that the younger ones should listen to them. This is to not be subject to one another. This is to lord it over others, to be the head. All the older ones have to learn to subject themselves to the dear young ones. Children of light walking in love and light would surely be subject to one another. The older ones should consider that they would still like to learn something from the young ones, and that the younger ones may know more than they do.</P><P>In any society there is the age barrier. Teenagers may prefer not to be with those who are over twenty. Even among the teenagers, the seventeen and eighteen year olds may prefer not to be with the thirteen and fourteen year olds. There is the elementary school level, the junior high school level, and the high school level. If we are separated by age levels in the church, we are defeated. We all need to be like little children (Luke 18:17). The younger ones do not need to be afraid of the older ones. As an older one, I like to live, meet, and serve with the younger ones.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
