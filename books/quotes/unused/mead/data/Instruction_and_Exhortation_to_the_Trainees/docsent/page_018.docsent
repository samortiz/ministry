   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT CARRYING OUT A "WORK"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ninth, you should not go to carry out a "work."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When some trainees return and their church agrees that they should serve the Lord full-time, they consider themselves a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Indeed, they are a co-worker, a full-time co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, they feel that they must do something because this "work" is their career.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They also expect to achieve something.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even some older co-workers among us considered that they had neither accomplished nor achieved anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In their consideration they felt that they should do something so that they could be today's Apostle Paul or at least a big evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was even a factor of the "fermentation" of the present rebellion among us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You should not have this kind of thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should consider your work as a part of your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your work is just your life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should not consider your work as being separate from your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>LIVING A DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Tenth, you need to be reminded all the time concerning the following four points that they should be the items of your daily life:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>a. Seeking and Saving Sinners</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must seek the sinners and get them saved and baptized regardless of what way you take.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether you go out and knock on doors or stay at home and call people on the telephone, you must bring the unbelievers to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you stay home and do not contact people, you will not see people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the Bible, God's ordained way is not to call meetings for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although this is not wrong, it is not the best way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way ordained by the Lord is for us to go to reach people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You should not call people to come, but you should go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Luke 10:2 and 6 tell us to go, even to the people's homes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 15:16 the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He appointed them to go forth and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must go and get the people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the divine revelation, the course of the world today consists of four things: the white horse gospel preaching; the red horse war; the black horse famine, the shortage of food; and the pale horse death Rev 6:2-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In God's eyes there is nothing else but these four horses carrying the gospel, war, famine, and death on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not preach the gospel, we are not on the white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may be on the red horse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we may say we are not in a war, there are different kinds of wars.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today, there is an educational war going on.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All of the colleges, the professors, and the students are competing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All this competition is a kind of war.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Countries and societies are also competing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is even a commercial war raging.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Firms and corporations are all competing and fighting for money and fighting to make more money.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The University of California at Berkeley has all the top professors because it pays more.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everybody today is for money.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Countries are competing for money.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Japan first used guns and warships to invade others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then they learned that this did not work so well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was not so profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So Japan developed automobiles like Toyota and Honda.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today, Toyota is a very effective weapon for the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result they have made a lot of money.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today other people are rising up to resist the Japanese financial expansion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even in the United Nations there is fighting daily among all the delegates.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are not using guns, but pens.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The entire world today is a fighting world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>War is going on everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, the more people fight, the more famine they have, and the more they are without God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is followed by death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, we are not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are on the white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am so happy that I am not on the black horse or pale horse, but on the white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The white horse includes preaching the gospel, having home meetings to feed the young ones, holding group meetings for perfecting, and prophesying to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not preach the gospel to save the sinners, if we do not have any young ones to feed, nourish, and cherish, if we do not collect the new ones together for a group meeting, or if we do not have the capacity and ability to prophesy for the building up of the church, we are not on the white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should be on the white horse, not the education horse, the corporation horse, or the computer horse.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should be on the white horse.</S>
