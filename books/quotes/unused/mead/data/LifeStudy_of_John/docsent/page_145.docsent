   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT LIFE S PRAYER 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the profound prayer uttered by the Lord in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This prayer is the completing prayer of the Lord s message given in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we read John 14 through 17 carefully, we shall realize that these four chapters have a very specific flavor in utterance and composition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This flavor is altogether different from the other chapters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although the whole Bible undoubtedly is God-breathed, these four chapters have a special taste, a special flavor, that no one can imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This flavor is not only holy but divine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No human being can utter something that is so divine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The flavor of these chapters is special, impressive, and unique because it is absolutely divine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The person who composed these chapters must have been divine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No human could have written something like this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No human being could say, Father, glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the Son of God could utter such words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although you may not understand these chapters, if you are in the spirit as you read them, you will sense the divine flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the divine speaking, the divine utterance, and the divine flow with the divine flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am confirmed in my belief that the Bible is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who besides God could have composed these four chapters?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Could John, a fisherman from Galilee, utter such things?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we gather together two hundred men with Ph.D. s, they would not have the substance to compose a writing with such a flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How we must worship the Lord for these four chapters!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must worship Him for the message He gave before His death, and we must worship Him for His concluding prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to understand the meaning of His prayer, we must remember the central thought of the message given by the Lord in the previous three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The central thought of that message is rich, deep, and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first aspect of this central thought is that the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, was sent by the Father to be among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit that He might be able to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, He was transfigured into the Holy Spirit, and He comes into us as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Holy Spirit comes into us, He comes as the Spirit of reality to make the Lord Jesus real to us in every respect.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By doing this, the Lord brings us into the Father and brings the Father into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Included in this mingling is the mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We become the abode to the Triune God, and the Triune God becomes the abode to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can abide in the Triune God, and the Triune God can abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the central thought of the profound and glorious message given by the Lord in these three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After giving that message, the Lord offered a closing prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the subject, the central thought, of this prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although the subject of this prayer depends very much upon the central thought of the preceding message, it is still difficult to discover what this subject is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I spent much time on John 17 without having any idea about the meaning of this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I was young, I heard that the Lord s prayer in this chapter was for oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But oneness, or the unity among the Lord s disciples, is not the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Oneness is on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Something deeper and more profound lies beneath the surface, and it is not easy for us to dig it out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John 17 is a deep chapter, and it is difficult to fathom it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How we thank the Lord that gradually, little by little, He has shown us the real meaning, the true significance, the central thought, of His prayer in this chapter.</S>
