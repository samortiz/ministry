   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man's Strong Spot</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a man opens his mouth, his spirit is exposed; others will know whether or not he has a right spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the spirit is exposed, the inner condition of a man is also exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In listening to someone, the first thing we have to find is his strong spot.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to ask, "What kind of impression do I have of this man?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What part of him is the strongest?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our spirit is open and pliable before the Lord, it will be sensitive and will detect any conspicuous spots.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once a man opens his mouth, his spirit is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In fact, his whole person is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are strong in their mind will touch others with their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who are subjective and stubborn will expose their stubbornness as soon as they open their mouth; they immediately will give others this impression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>James 3:17 speaks of those who are peaceable and forbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is easy to ask such ones to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But others will not yield even when others plead with them for hours.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is hard to ask a subjective and strong-willed person for anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then there are those who are very strong in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Others can sense this as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A person who is strong in his emotion is easily influenced by others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he speaks about love, he is not necessarily speaking about what is truly love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If our spirit is pure and meek, we will easily touch others' conspicuous spots.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These conspicuous spots are actually the trouble spots; they are the areas that need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must not only touch others' spirit with our spirit, but we must touch the conspicuous spots with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to know the kind of people with whom we are dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Closed Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Generally speaking, when we speak to a brother, we can touch his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But sometimes a man's spirit will not come out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may speak to him for a long time, but we cannot sense his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His real person is hidden, and we do not know what is happening within him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His real person is so deeply hidden that we cannot tell his true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a one has great problems.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's children should be very approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should live according to the principle of "amen."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a person does something or says something, our inner being should be able to respond with an "amen."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But some people are always hidden behind or within their outer man; they cannot produce an "amen" in others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are very secretive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one knows them, and they have fellowship with no one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a dangerous position to be in. These ones are so individualistic that others cannot touch their genuine person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a result they are cut off from the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christians should be deep, but at the same time, they have to be genuine in their expression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They have to allow others to touch their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who do not allow others to touch their spirit are cut off from the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They have not learned the proper lessons of the Body and know nothing about fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people have been Christians for eight or ten years, yet others cannot touch their spirit at all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Their spirit is a closed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to test whether a man's spirit can be touched by others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If it cannot be touched, something is wrong with that person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the world, a person can be as subtle as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christians, however, should not be this way; their spirit should be open and free to fellowship with others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>An Abnormal Person</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When a person speaks, we should listen carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The words may tell us whether the speaker has a strong spirit, a conspicuous mind, or a subjective disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although some are particularly strong in some areas, on the whole they still may be proper persons.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some are particularly strong in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not uncommon.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, there are those who are not only exceptionally strong in their mind and emotion but different to the point of being abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we contact such ones, we cannot deal with them according to ordinary means.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are distorted, peculiar, and extreme in their mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Their psychology is different from that of ordinary men.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are warped.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Such ones are not few in number.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Among a hundred persons, one always can find a few who are altogether abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Their thoughts and behavior are completely different from ordinary men, and their will is always at odds with others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Such ones become a problem to others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They cannot be tackled in the usual way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They must be dealt with severely by special means.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The very constitution of their being is warped.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we employ ordinary means and try to exhort them twenty times, they will come back and disappoint us twenty times.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They are set in their character already.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our eyes should be opened to such odd personalities.</S>
