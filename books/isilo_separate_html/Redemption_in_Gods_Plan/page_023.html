<p>The first creature in the universe to rebel against God and to seek to frustrate God&rsquo;s plan was Satan. He is behind every act of rebellion against God in the universe and is God&rsquo;s adversary. He introduced sin into the world, injected sin into man, and enticed man to commit sins. If the Lord had dealt only with sins and our fallen humanity on the cross, God&rsquo;s enemy would be able to continue to frustrate God&rsquo;s plan unhindered. Therefore, the cross had to deal not only with sins and fallen humanity but also with Satan and everything related to Satan. We need to see that when the Lord dealt with our fallen human nature, He also dealt with the Satan who was in man as well as everything related to Satan.</p>
<p>Satan entered into man when he enticed man to sin. He has been in man since the time of the fall, and his satanic nature is mixed with the fallen human nature. Thus, when the Lord Jesus dealt with man in His death on the cross, He dealt with the Satan who was in man. Before the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He said, &ldquo;Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out&rdquo; (John 12:31). The ruler of this world is Satan, whose sinful nature is mixed with fallen man and who has usurped fallen man. Our co-crucifixion with the Lord on the cross dealt with the fallen human nature, which is mixed with Satan and usurped by Satan. Hence, the Lord also dealt with Satan, who was mixed with man and who had usurped man. The Bible says that the Lord destroyed Satan through His death on the cross (Heb. 2:14). Seemingly, Satan was victorious when he entered into man by enticing man to sin. However, this was Satan&rsquo;s downfall, because this gave God the opportunity to deal with him. Satan thought that he could trick man and usurp man by indwelling man as sin, but he was ensnared in man and able to be put under God&rsquo;s judgment and destruction. God judged and destroyed Satan in man, whom Satan had tricked and usurped.</p>
<p>We were tricked by Satan into following him to sin and oppose God. However, when we were judged and put to death by God through the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross, Satan was judged and destroyed by God as well, because he dwells in us as sin. Furthermore, the angels under Satan&mdash;the rulers, the authorities, the world-rulers of this darkness, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies&mdash;were also judged and destroyed with Satan by God (Eph. 6:12). When Satan was judged and destroyed, they were judged and destroyed, because he is their ruler and they follow him (2:2; Col. 2:15). Satan and his angels have been dealt with by the cross of Christ. The cross destroyed Satan, the ruler of this darkness, as well as his kingdom of darkness with its rulers and authorities. Not that many believers know this fact, but Satan, his angels, and the demons in his kingdom of darkness are well aware of this matter. We know the power of the Lord&rsquo;s cross when we cast out demons. In spiritual warfare we can overcome Satan when we experience the Lord&rsquo;s cross and His shed blood (Rev. 12:11). Such experiences cause Satan and his angels to fall in shame.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s cross judged and destroyed Satan, and it also judged and destroyed the world ruled by Satan. The God-opposing world is of Satan, and it hangs upon him. Satan has been judged and destroyed by the Lord on the cross; hence, in God&rsquo;s eyes the world that hangs upon him has also been judged and destroyed (John 16:11). Those who have God&rsquo;s view know that the world also has been crucified (Gal. 6:14).</p>
<p>On the cross the Lord dealt with sins, the old creation, Satan, and the world that Satan rules. When the Lord died on the cross, our sins, our old man, Satan, and the world were judged and dealt with there. On the one hand, the Lord bore our sins and suffered the judgment of death on the cross; on the other hand, He was crucified as a man, having put on humanity. In addition, Satan, who indwells man as sin, and the world, which hangs upon him, were crucified. The Lord&rsquo;s cross dealt with these four matters in the universe. The cross delivers us from sin and our old man, and it also causes us to overcome Satan and the world. This is the third accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross for us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross of Christ Releasing the Life of God</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose in His plan is to work His life into man, but Satan corrupted man by injecting sin into man. Thus, God&rsquo;s purpose was frustrated. In order to accomplish His purpose, God dealt with these two problems&mdash;sin and fallen man&mdash;and also annihilated Satan through the cross of Christ. Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s purpose still would not be fulfilled if the cross of Christ only accomplished this much. The cross of Christ dealt with sin and fallen humanity and annihilated Satan on the negative side, but the cross of Christ also released the divine life in Christ on the positive side. Now God&rsquo;s eternal purpose can be accomplished.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that He would abide alone unless He fell into the ground and died as a grain of wheat, but that if He fell into the ground and died, He would bear much fruit (John 12:24). The Lord is the embodiment of God; the life of God is hidden in Him (Col. 1:19; 2:9), but the life of God that was hidden within Him could only be released through His death. Hence, Christ had to die in order for God&rsquo;s life to be released so that man could receive the life of God.</p>
<p>Many believe that the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross accomplished redemption for our sins and dealt with the problems between man and God, but they do not see the life-releasing aspect, the life-imparting aspect, of the Lord&rsquo;s death. In relation to dealing with the problems between man and God, the Lord&rsquo;s death accomplished redemption for our sins. In relation to accomplishing God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, the Lord&rsquo;s death released the divine life. The life-releasing aspect, the life-imparting aspect, of the Lord&rsquo;s death is typified by Adam&rsquo;s deep sleep. God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and He took out one of Adam&rsquo;s ribs. Then God built Eve out of the rib that He had taken from Adam&rsquo;s side (Gen. 2:21-22). Similarly, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the Lord Jesus when He died on the cross so that blood and water could flow out of His pierced side (John 19:34). Now the life of God is available to man in order to produce the church.</p>
<p>As a result of His death on the cross, the life within Christ was released to produce many grains of wheat so that God&rsquo;s eternal purpose might be fulfilled. This aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death is for releasing life. One aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death is for redemption. The aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death as a grain of wheat, however, has nothing to do with redemption. Rather, it speaks of the release of the divine life from within Him. When God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, it was not for redeeming Eve but for releasing Adam&rsquo;s life to produce Eve.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was incarnated as a man to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which is to dispense His life into us so that we may become His many sons, possessing His life, just as the Lord Jesus possesses God&rsquo;s life. The divine life was once confined within the shell of Christ&rsquo;s humanity. The Lord went to the cross so that the divine life within the shell of His humanity could be released from within Him. His death on the cross destroyed His human shell so that God&rsquo;s life could be released and then imparted into many through His resurrection to make them sons of God and thus accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. This is the fourth accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen the four accomplishments of the Lord on the cross, we know the effectiveness of the cross. On the negative side, the Lord accomplished redemption for our sins, put to death our old man, the flesh, and the self, and annihilated Satan, who defiled us, and the world, which usurped us. On the positive side, the Lord released the life of God so that we might receive this life and become sons of God. Now all the problems in the universe have been dealt with, and God&rsquo;s eternal purpose can be carried out. Now any person can draw near to Christ and be redeemed in order to receive the life of God. Every person can and should let God&rsquo;s eternal purpose be fulfilled in him.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ dealt with sins, the old man, the flesh, Satan, demons, and the world. These things have lost their power, and they no longer are a frustration to the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose in us. The eternal life of God was released on the cross of Christ so that we can receive this life in order to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. All the problems in the universe that existed between man and God have been removed by the cross of Christ, and the living water of the divine life is now flowing for man to receive.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
