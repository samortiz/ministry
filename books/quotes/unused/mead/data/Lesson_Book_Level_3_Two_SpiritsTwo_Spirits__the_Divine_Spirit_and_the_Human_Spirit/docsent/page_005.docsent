   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HUMAN SPIRIT A. For Contacting God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man can be likened to a radio.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit of God is like the heavenly radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spirit in man is like the radio receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many radios do not function because their owners do not use their spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>People are unable to contact God because the receiver within them is out of order.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If man did not have a spirit, he would be unable to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Being the Key to the Christian Life</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is in our spirit that we were born again John 3:6 ; it is in our spirit that we were made alive Eph 2:5; Rom 8:10 ; it is in our spirit that God dwells Eph 2:22; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:16 ; it is in our spirit that we are joined to the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 ; and it is in our spirit that we contact and worship God John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we must walk and have our whole being according to our spirit serving in our spirit Rom 1:9 , praying in spirit Eph 6:18 , being filled in spirit Eph 5:18 , seeing God's revelation in spirit Eph 1:17; 3:5; Rev 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10 , having fellowship with the brothers and sisters in spirit Phil 2:1 ; and being built together with others into a dwelling place of God in spirit Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>C. The Greatness of Man's Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Zechariah 12:1 tells us that there are three crucial things in God's creation: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It says that Jehovah is the One who "stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How great is our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The heavens are for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without the heavens, the earth could not have anything organic.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The earth is for man, and man is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For man to be for God, he needs a receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This receiver is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Praise the Lord that we are here under God's plan and in His plan; that we have been made by Him in His image and after His likeness; that we have a spirit to receive Him; and that He, as the divine Spirit, has entered into our human spirit, making us His sons for His expression!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's eternal purpose is to have a people that would express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way He fulfills this purpose is called His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His economy, God as the Spirit dispenses Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is able to dispense Himself into man because He is the Spirit and man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit transmits the entire Triune God, and the human spirit receives this transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our spirit is the means for us to contact the Triune God; therefore the human spirit is a great thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the divine Spirit entering the human spirit, God will accomplish His desire.</S>
