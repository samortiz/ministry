   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Leaving the Moral World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we Christians must come out of the system and the organization of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Leaving the world refers to our deliverance from the moral world, not the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to leave the moral world behind, not the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, we are still living in the world, but this world has become a wilderness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the world to us?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mr. D. M. Panton put it well when he said, While I am living, it is a journey to me; when I die, it is a tomb to me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While a believer is living on this earth, the world is a journey to him; when he dies, the world is only a tomb in which he is buried.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must be separated from the people of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every believer must be separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the eyes of the world, we are in the wilderness; we are pilgrims.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are the ones who are in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>E. Sojourners and Pilgrims in this World</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must realize that we are sojourners and pilgrims in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As far as the moral world is concerned, we have come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It wants to keep us, but if we stay, we will not be able to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The world wants to be closer to us, but if we allow it to come too close to us, it will be impossible for us to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The world wants to keep our people and our treasure, but if these things are kept in the world, we will not be able to serve our God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have been separated from Egypt, and our faces are toward the promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The basis of that separation is the blood, the blood that has bought us back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Egyptians have not been bought by the blood; the worldly ones have not been redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As redeemed ones, we have been transferred to another world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we must leave this world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose you go to a watch shop to buy a watch.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What do you do after you have bought it?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once the purchase has been made, you take the watch away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I should not buy the watch and leave it behind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I should not tell the proprietor, Here, you use it!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Buying means taking away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever there is a purchase, there is a taking away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If I buy a sack of rice, the rice is taken away from the shop.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After one buys something, the purchased item is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please remember that since the blood has bought us, we must be taken away from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once a person is bought by the Lord s blood, he should leave for the promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as one is bought, he should leave.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who are not bought can stay behind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But as soon as a person is bought, he should leave.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once a person is bought, he has no choice but to go with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I have been bought by the Lord, I must leave the world and go with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>AREAS THAT REQUIRE SEPARATION</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>FROM THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may ask what we should separate ourselves from.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What things are considered the world?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What areas should we be separated from?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before we touch any specific item, we should realize that our heart and spirit are the first things that need separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If a person s heart is set towards the world, it becomes futile to speak to him about anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is useless to try to be delivered from a hundred things if the person himself still remains in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First, there must be a deliverance of the person, a deliverance of the spirit, and a deliverance of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Deliverance from matters comes later.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A man must be separated completely from Egypt; he must be separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He should not be afraid that others will criticize him as being peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then there is the need to take care of some principles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In some areas we should be separated from the world, while in other areas we should maintain peace with it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have no intention to be contentious.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the family, in the office, and everywhere, we do not want to arouse controversy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let us consider five specific things that need to be dealt with:</S>
