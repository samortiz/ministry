   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SEVENTH SEAL SILENCE IN HEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>REVELATION 8:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the time that the seventh seal is opened, all noise stops.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The whole universe is silent; even the throne is silent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is because the age is about to change.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"And I saw the seven angels who stand before God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The angels are standing, while the twenty-four elders are sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The seven angels have instruments in front of them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, some have thought that Gabriel should be one among them cf.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Luke 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The trumpets are for warfare 1 Cor 14:8; Amos 3:6; Exo 19:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The heavenly will is ready for the sounding of the trumpets, but God has to wait for something to be accomplished before He will issue the command.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has to wait for His sons to express their sympathy towards Him; that is, He has to wait for the prayer of Revelation 8:3-5.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mr. Gordon said, "Prayer is the tracks for God's will to run on."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>X. THE SCENE IN HEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>AFTER THE OPENING OF THE SEVENTH SEAL</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>REVELATION 8:3-5 A. Revelation 8:3</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"And another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The "another Angel" is the Priest; this is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The prayers of the saints are offered to God through the incense of this "another Angel."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No Christian can offer up prayer by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There must be the incense, which is the merit of Christ's work, the fragrance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The believers' prayer must be joined to the fragrance of Christ before it can reach God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why does this verse call the Lord an angel and not a priest?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hebrews 2:16 says, "Assuredly it is not to angels that He gives help."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the Epistles show us that, in the Lord's relationship to us, He takes the position of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 2:17 says, "He should have been made like His brothers in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because He is a man, He can draw near to man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His being the "Angel" implies that He is higher than man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Genesis 18:2, 16, and 22, the Lord is described as a man who drew near to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, in Genesis 19:1 He came to Lot as an "angel," showing that He was apart from man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later when He was helping Lot, He appeared as a man again Gen 19:10, 12, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 8:3 says that the Lord is "another Angel."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that the age has changed; He is no longer the Son of Man of the age of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has now become "another Angel," yet He is still a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The saints here are in the midst of tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Old Testament, the incense had to be lit with the fire from the altar; no strange fire could be offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The altar is a type of the Lord's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The incense is our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, one can only come to God through the merit and the redemption of the Lord's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Prayer cannot be offered up with strange fire fire that is not from the altar .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, without the cross, there can be no prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>B. Revelation 8:4</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the Angel before God."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"The smoke of the incense."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The incense is lit, and the smoke of the incense signifies the Lord's merit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only smoke will ascend.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without the Lord's incense, no prayer can ascend to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>C. Revelation 8:5</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"And the Angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth; and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"And there were thunders..."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is God's answer to the prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although we do not know the content of the prayers, we know what the prayers are about from the fact that they are answered.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The prayers of the saints here correspond with the cry from underneath the altar of the fifth seal; they are the prayers of those who ask to be avenged Luke 18:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"The Angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is cast back to the same place from whence it came.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That which is cast to the earth is God's judgment.</S>
