   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COMING TO THE MEETINGS WITH A LIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because most of us came from the background of traditional Christianity, and we still have that environment surrounding us, it is very hard to change our concept concerning the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past we have preached the gospel in a living way to people who were one hundred percent Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They never had any connection or relationship with a so-called Christian church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When they were saved, we simply gave them a little word, and they all knew how to function.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For many old Christians, though, it is very hard to function, because they have too much influence from their background.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must try our best to drop our backgrounds and learn to live and walk in the spirit by enjoying and experiencing Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Day by day we enjoy Christ, and day by day we experience Him in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then whenever we come together, we come with a living, satisfied, refreshed, strengthened, uplifted, positive, and active spirit and with a certain amount of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we come to a meeting, we should not consider what kind of meeting it is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, we must consider it as a chance to worship, to share our burden, and to do our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should forget our considerations and simply come to meet with one another as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a matter of whether or not we are in the spirit, whether or not we are praying in the spirit with something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we share something of Christ from the spirit, any portion is good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That will never disturb the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As long as we exercise our spirit to express and minister something of Christ, that is right.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That will release others' spirits, bring in the flow, and spontaneously begin the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps we will not sing a hymn at the beginning of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The brothers and sisters may simply pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It may be, though, that we sing hymn after hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should have no regulation, only the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, this flow absolutely depends on a living spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our spirit must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When our spirit is dead and we are poor with Christ, having nothing of Christ, whatever we do will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if everyone opens his mouth, that still will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In fact, the more we open our mouth, the more we will have a stinking odor, not the odor of a sweet fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever we do must be something living that comes from within.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Someone may ask, "What if I am fallen and have a failure the day of the meeting?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have not only the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We also have the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have a failure, we should come to the meeting with a contrite spirit to repent and confess before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can exercise our contrite spirit to offer a prayer to the Lord for confession, repenting and applying the cleansing of the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even this kind of prayer will bring a flow into the meeting, because it is something living, something of Christ, and a real experience of Christ as the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps then the flow will bring in many prayers of appreciation to Christ as the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many may follow to pray, "Lord, we do thank You that we have the experience of You being our trespass offering."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That will be something living in the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must prepare ourselves to come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have a deep sense that we need to change our concept and change our way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will help us to be diligent and fervent in the spirit in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we can come to the meeting in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Someone may say that not meeting in the traditional way will cause confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether or not releasing our spirit will cause confusion is yet to be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us try it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If it causes confusion, we can try something else.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us go on and see what we find and what will come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please be at peace; I can assure you that we will not suffer a loss by exercising our spirit in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am not suggesting that we change a form or regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That never works.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, we have to change our concept and realization.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to change the way of our Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to learn how to live and walk in and by Christ by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our realization and concept must change, and our way of living must be different.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then when we come together, spontaneously we will have something of Christ.</S>
