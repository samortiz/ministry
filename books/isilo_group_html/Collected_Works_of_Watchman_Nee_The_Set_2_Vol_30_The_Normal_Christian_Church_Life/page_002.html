The 1939 English edition presents Watchman Nee's own work in the English language; he was directly responsible for its translation and editing. Any differences between the English and Chinese editions reflect Watchman Nee's own revisions. The contents of Volume 30 have been published separately by Living Stream Ministry under the title The Normal Christian Church Life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 30: The Normal Christian Church Life &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
