   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOLDING TO OUR OWN RULES AND PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No matter what our nationality may be, we all unconsciously or subconsciously hold to certain principles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all have our own basic principles or elementary rules.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, we may follow the principle of always being nice and never losing our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose an unmarried sister living in the sisters house has such a principle to regulate her daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If she loses her temper, she will be filled with regret.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She may even cry in remorse because she has broken one of her basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a sister is about to get married, she may vow to herself that she will never lose her temper with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She may never tell others that she has made such a vow, but God knows about it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, this vow may become an elementary principle which governs this sister s married life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From the first day of her marriage, she walks according to this elementary principle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, to take such a principle as our elementary principle is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only elementary principle we should take is that of walking according to the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead of caring about our temper, we should simply live a new creation as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather than practice niceness or submissiveness, we should practice the divine sonship, the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>TAKING THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>AS OUR BASIC PRINCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The new creation must be our basic principle, our elementary rule.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Son of God with the divine life and the divine nature dwells in us to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, we now have the divine element, even the processed God Himself within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a tremendous difference it makes to take this element as our basic principle and walk according to it!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I was young, I once heard a missionary say that the teachings of the Bible and those of Confucius are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He went on to tell us that Confucius teaches us to honor our parents and that the Bible does likewise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then he went on to encourage us to accept Christianity, since its teachings were the same as those of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I heard this, I said to myself, If this is true, why should we accept Christianity when we already have the teachings of Confucius?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What blindness to say that the teachings of Confucius and those of the Bible are the same!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>AS THE ELEMENTARY RULE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible does not teach us to seek the help of the Holy Spirit to behave properly as God s creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the revelation in the Bible, God s intention is to make us His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His creation of mankind, God made the necessary preparations to reach this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He created man in His image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He designed and created man as a vessel to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we became fallen, God sent His Son to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we believed in Christ, God sent the Spirit of His Son into us to regenerate us and make us sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now the Spirit, the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, dwells in our spirit to work, move, act, and anoint us that we may be sons of God in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As God s sons, we need to walk according to this Spirit, taking the Spirit as our elementary rule, our basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To walk by the Spirit in this way is to walk according to the elementary principles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not take ethical standards or religious requirements as our principle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, our elementary principle should be the new creation, the divine sonship with the life and nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Day by day, we need to take the sonship, the new creation, as our elementary principle and walk according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do this, we shall grow in God s sonship unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then one day we shall be in glory, and God will shine forth from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way we shall be a vast, universal, corporate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That will be the consummation of the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In our daily life we should practice living according to this sonship as our basic principle, our elementary rule.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Praise the Lord that it is possible for us to walk in this way!</S>
