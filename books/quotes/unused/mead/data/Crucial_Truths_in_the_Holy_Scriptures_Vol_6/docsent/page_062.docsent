   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One requirement for being raptured before the tribulation and escaping the great tribulation is to be watchful at every time, beseeching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that we should not be entangled in the affairs of the world but constantly live before the Lord and that we specifically beseech the Lord concerning being raptured to escape the great tribulation.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must do everything according to the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether we are a full-time servant of the Lord or serve the Lord in a job, it is not easy to keep the Lord s word in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Endurance is needed because everything on the earth is against the Lord s word.</S>

   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Since the overcomers in this verse are equal to the overcomers spoken of in Revelation 12:5, who are raptured to God s throne before the great tribulation, being an overcomer is a requirement for being raptured before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Such an overcomer also keeps the Lord s works until the end. If we want to be worthy of being raptured to the Lord s presence to escape the great tribulation, we must keep the Lord s works until the end as an overcomer today.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May we pay attention to these five requirements to be raptured before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>May we learn to be overcomers living before the Lord by watching, preparing, and waiting for Him to come!</S>
