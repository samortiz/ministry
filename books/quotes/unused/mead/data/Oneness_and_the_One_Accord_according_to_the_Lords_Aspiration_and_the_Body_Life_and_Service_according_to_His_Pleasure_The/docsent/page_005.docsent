   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>One in the Reality of the Sanctifying Word</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second level of oneness is the oneness of all the believers in the reality of the Father's sanctifying word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord has given us the Father's name and His eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But He did not ask us to leave the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How then should we live in the world?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this purpose, He has given us the Father's word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father's word has God Himself as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God as the reality is in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without God's word, we cannot touch God's reality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today God is in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This word contains the reality of God, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God Himself as this reality has a special function, which is to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those of us who read God's word frequently have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether or not we understand the Bible, as long as we read a little of God's Word in the morning and consider this Word a little during the day, we are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One saint confessed that his mind was not sharp and that he tended to forget about the things he read in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Watchman Nee comforted him by saying that it was all right to forget what one had read in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He illustrated by saying that when one takes a bamboo basket to the river to wash the rice in the basket, one drops the basket in and out of the water many times.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although no water is left in the basket, the basket itself and the rice in it are all washed clean.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times we exert great effort in memorizing the words of the Bible, only to find that after a few days we remember nothing; everything seems to be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in fact, when we read the Lord's Word again and again, all the worldly matters in us are removed, and we are cleansed and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's word brings in God's reality, and in us it produces a special effect, which is to sanctify us and to deliver us from this mixed world that we may be separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The world is very mixed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But God's word of reality sanctifies us and makes us pure.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The result of this purity is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Anything that is separated is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more a person is in the word of God, the purer he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A man who is not in God's word but is in the world is complicated and impure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He may not be very literate, yet he can still be very complicated within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if we have God's word within, this word with God's reality will do a sanctifying work within us to separate us unto God, thus making us pure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is on the side of purity, and Satan as the prince of the world is on the side of complication.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Satan is the prince of the mixed-up world, but our God is the God of purity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word of reality sanctifies us and delivers us from the mixed-up world, turning us back to the purity in God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the Father's name is the source of our oneness; the Father's life is the element of our oneness; and the Father's sanctifying word is the means of our oneness, bringing us to the sphere of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of the Father, not only is our source one and our nature one, but where we are also becomes one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One in the Expression of the Divine Glory</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lastly, the third level of the oneness is the oneness of all the believers in the expression of the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In John 17:22 the Lord Jesus said to the Father, "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the revelation of the Bible and in comparison with our experience, glory here refers to the Father's life with His nature to express His divine virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the glory of God is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Glory is not a sudden kind of beam that shines on us and surrounds us from without.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, it is the Father's divine life with the divine nature, expressing a kind of divine radiance and splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This divine, splendid expression delivers us from ourselves and makes us fully one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first level of the oneness is in the Father's name and life, delivering us from the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The second level of the oneness is in the reality of the Father's sanctifying word, delivering us from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now the third level of the oneness is in the Father's glory, delivering us from ourselves and causing us to become fully one in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to realize that this oneness is the Body of Christ; it is the real and practical church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is the oneness lived out of the believers in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This oneness has God as the source and His life as the essence, in which the radiance and splendor in divinity are fully expressed through God's life and nature in a sanctified realm.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is also the building.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is something we ought to treasure and pursue.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we should all be clear that the oneness of the Lord's believers is not as we imagined.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not a oneness arrived at by dropping our opinions and agreeing mutually with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The genuine oneness of the church is a oneness in which we have the Father Himself as the source, the Father's life as the nature, and the Father's sanctifying reality as the realm, which enables us to live in purity, being unrelated to the world, and which expresses the divine radiance and splendor through God's life with His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This oneness is the Body of Christ; it is also the building God is after.</S>
