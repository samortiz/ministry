[1]  concerning God s New Testament Economy The three thousand believers who were saved on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers Acts 2:41-42: The teaching and the fellowship form one group which is of the apostles and related directly to God s economy for the keeping of the oneness of the church, the Body of Christ; both are unique: The teaching of the apostles was the holding factor of the one accord Acts 2:42a, 46a.
[2]  The entire teaching of the New Testament, which is the apostles teaching, is God s speaking, God s oracle, in the Son to His New Testament people Heb 1:1-2: In the universe there is a marvelous matter, God s speaking Heb 1:2: In the age of the New Testament God does not speak to His people in many portions and in many ways or through the prophets.
[3]  the Central Line of the Divine Revelation God s economy is His household administration 1 Tim 1:4: The Greek word for economy means household law, implying distribution; it denotes a household management, a household administration, a household government, and, derivatively, a dispensation, a plan, or an economy for administration distribution ; hence, it is also a household economy.
[4]  God s economy is His household economy, His household administration, which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church, the Body of Christ.
[5]  We need to see a vision of God s economy Eph 1:10: God s economy is His plan to dispense Himself into His chosen, predestinated, and redeemed people as their life, their life supply, and their everything to produce, constitute, and build up the organic Body of Christ.
[6]  to Carry Out His Eternal Economy There are two basic divine titles for God in the Old Testament: Elohim Gen 1:1 is used in relation to God s creation, and its plurality implies the Divine Trinity, thus denoting the unique yet triune God.
[7]  This is accomplished by creating man in His image and after His likeness Gen 1:26-27 , becoming a man in His incarnation to partake of the human nature Heb 2:14a , living a human life to express His attributes through man s virtues, dying an all-inclusive death, resurrecting to become the firstborn Son of God and the life-giving Spirit Rom 8:29; Acts 13:33; 1 Cor 15:45 , dispensing Himself into His chosen people to regenerate them with Himself as their life for producing many sons 1 Pet 1:3 , forming the churches with His many sons, and building up the Body of Christ with His brothers as the members to be the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God to consummate the New Jerusalem as His eternal enlargement and expression.
[8]  of God s New Testament Economy Christ has the preeminence, the first place, in all things Col 1:18: Christ has the preeminence in the Triune Godhead the first, the Father, always exalts the Son, and the third, the Spirit, always testifies concerning the Son Phil 2:9; John 15:26: Christ has the first place in all things; for in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell Col 1:18b-19.
[9]  Message Six The Full Ministry of Christ in Three Stages
[10]  Incarnation, Inclusion, and Intensification The first stage of the full ministry of Christ is the stage of His incarnation, the stage of Christ in the flesh, from His human birth through His human living to His death: In His incarnation, Christ brought the infinite God into the finite man; He also united and mingled the Triune God with the tripartite man.
[11]  In His human living, Christ expressed in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues: Christ expressed the bountiful God in His human living, mainly expressing God in His rich attributes.
[12]  The second stage of the full ministry of Christ is the stage of His inclusion, the stage of Christ as the life-giving Spirit, from His resurrection to the degradation of the church: In His resurrection, Christ was begotten as God s firstborn Son Acts 13:33: From eternity past without beginning, Christ was God s only begotten Son, possessing only divinity, without humanity, and not having passed through death into resurrection.
[13]  The third stage of the full ministry of Christ is the stage of His intensification, the stage of Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit, from the degradation of the church to the consummation of the New Jerusalem: The first thing which Christ is doing in the third stage of His ministry is to intensify His organic salvation: On the way of Christ s ministry in the stage of His inclusion, which is to carry out His organic salvation for the producing of the church and the building up of His Body to consummate the New Jerusalem, the church became degraded, frustrating the accomplishment of God s eternal economy.
[14]  The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of God with the element of divinity Gen 1:1-2; Matt 12:28; Rom 8:9; 1 Cor 2:11-12: In the phrase the Spirit of God, God is in apposition to Spirit; thus, the Spirit of God means that God is the Spirit and the Spirit is God.
[15]  Judicial Redemption plus Organic Salvation God s complete salvation is of two aspects the judicial aspect and the organic aspect: God s judicial redemption is the judicial aspect of God s complete salvation: It is according to the righteousness of God Rom 1:17a; 3:21-26; 9:30-31.
[16]  the Organism of the Triune God The vision of the Body of Christ: The goal of God s eternal economy is to create, to constitute, and to produce a Body for Christ, who will gain this Body, which is a part of Himself, to be His counterpart, His bride, and consummately the New Jerusalem.
[17]  as Many Local Churches The church of God, as the universal Body of Christ, the universal house of God, and the kingdom of God Eph 1:22-23; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Matt 16:18-19 , is expressed practically as many local churches Rev 1:4a, 11 , and all the local churches, being the one Body of Christ separated by localities for their existence, express the same one Body, not respectively but corporately.
[18]  the Consummation of God s Eternal Economy The New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the entire divine revelation and the central and ultimate consummated significance of the entire divine revelation Rev 21:2, 9-10: The New Jerusalem is the conclusion and the total composition of the entire revelation of the Bible.
[19]  The New Jerusalem is not a physical city but an organic constitution constituted with the redeeming processed and consummated Triune God with the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man as an organism of the consummated Triune God for His eternal enlargement and expression through the glorified tripartite man: The New Jerusalem is the composition of all the Old Testament and New Testament saints built together as God s eternal building.
