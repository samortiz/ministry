   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROSPECT OF THE NEW WAY AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE KEY TO ITS SUCCESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From now on, the way the church should take is to knock on doors, lead people to be baptized, and set up home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The regular church life is the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If in Taipei there are one hundred twenty thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly and are reliable, their coming together to meet week after week will have a great impact here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This many brothers and sisters will comprise at least thirty to forty thousand families.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we have not worked to this extent, we can already see that there are familiar faces everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we must work out the estimated number by the Lord s grace until there are nine hundred sixty thousand brothers and sisters living the Christian life in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This outlook seems unlimited, but it will be achieved one day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I hope that every one of our brothers and sisters will have a normal living, proper attire, and an appropriately furnished home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are all proper and we spread throughout the different classes of society, the impact will be immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that what the Lord said in Matthew 5 will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There the Lord said that the disciples are the salt of the earth v. 13 . The earth has been corrupted, but salt comes to kill the germs of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The disciples are also the light of the world effacing the world s darkness v. 14 . We believe that within ten years this condition will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope the young people can all focus on this target.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is more valuable than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The key to success depends very much on our use of Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot go through these four volumes in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We estimate that although there are only forty-eight lessons, it takes one and a half years to complete this course.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What we expect is that after one and a half years, after we have gone through all the forty-eight lessons of the four volumes of Life Lessons, the new ones we lead will become what we are, and the number of saints will double.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we multiply in this way, the people we gain will not be indifferent or like the church members in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ones we gain will be solid.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all today have studied in school.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have studied science, English, and many subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, our parents, who were born many years earlier, did not have the environment or opportunity to study.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, it is difficult and too harsh for us to demand that they learn what we know.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the same in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot make harsh demands on the elderly brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we hope that the young full-timers will learn well, specifically to gain people wherever they go.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CONTACTING PEOPLE WITH A LONG-TERM VIEW</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To others our door-knocking and visiting are like drinking sweet and sour soup.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When people first receive it, it is hot and sour, but after they receive it, they find it very sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When people see us neatly dressed and knocking on their door, they feel embarrassed if they do not open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, once they open, they cannot get rid of us, and eventually we even baptize them in water, which is difficult for them to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nevertheless, when they listen to us, they find that what we speak is real.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What we are bringing to their home is a diamond, and they feel it would be a pity if they did not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is why our visiting is like sweet and sour soup.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, people may think that if they receive what we speak, that will be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But then we begin a home meeting, which brings them not only the Lord Jesus but also the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That is why they may show us a long face when we first come, but after talking with us for five minutes, their face relaxes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then after talking for another five minutes, they begin to smile, and after ten more minutes they will pray, sing hymns, and thank and praise the Lord together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Finally, they will even make an appointment with us for the next visit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is all our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After they see us off, however, they may reconsider what has just happened, and they may start to doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, they believe, but on the other hand, they may doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After doubting they believe again, and after believing they have doubts again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as you are a Christian, you will have this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is like someone who grinds in a mill; first he pushes the grindstone in one direction, and then he pushes it in the other.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When you have gained more experiences, the Lord Jesus will make even more trouble for you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the past we were free to watch movies, play sports, and travel around freely wherever we desired.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, it is now different.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord in us often objects to this and disagrees with that, which makes us feel uneasy within.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all have had these experiences after believing in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are progressing or backsliding, going up or down all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Moreover, on this path there are many temptations, especially after we have started to serve the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we look at ourselves, we find ourselves meeting today, meeting tomorrow, and serving the day after, but no matter what we do, we will never get rich.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some of our classmates have become great in the exporting business or as contractors, but we are still poor preachers loving the Lord and thanking and praising Him every day.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Others can hardly understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 1944 I needed to recuperate from an illness for two and a half years, and I was alone in Tsingdao for the last one and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because of my tuberculosis, I could not walk for a very long distance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One day as I took my cane and went for a walk in the scenic area of Tsingdao, I was complaining and feeling sorry for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I considered that I was empty-handed, possessing nothing, and without my family.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I felt that I had nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It was at that very moment that the Lord operated in me again and made me joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then I began to thank and praise Him because I knew that what I had gained was the most precious thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>People in the world pursue after houses, land, and other things, which are dung.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The only truly valuable thing is to gain the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not be afraid that the newly saved ones will have fluctuating feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Man s feelings are like the weather; if the weather is not good, after a couple of days it will be sunny again.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not look only at people s outward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It does not matter if they are not joyful today because they will be joyful again tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, we who serve the Lord should have a long-term view, because there will be a time when people come to the end of their life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>At that time everyone who believes in the Lord will see that what he has done has been very valuable.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When someone approaches death, he will understand that houses, companies, and money do not count.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All that is valuable is the Lord deep within him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is nothing more valuable than what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to be encouraged by this good prospect that there will be Christians everywhere meeting in different homes.</S>
