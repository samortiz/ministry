   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Through Faith of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Bible students have great difficulty with the phrase faith of Jesus Christ 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some say that it means our act of believing in Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Others argue that it refers to the faith of Jesus, that the faith of Jesus becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I would put it this way: genuine believing is to believe in the Lord Jesus by His faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We believe in Jesus Christ by His faith, for we have no faith of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus is the Author and Finisher of our faith Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more we look at ourselves and examine ourselves, the faster our faith disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Faith is not our invention; it can never be initiated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is impossible for us to generate faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Faith is an aspect of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In fact, faith is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Galatians 2:20 says that we live by the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not live by my faith I have no faith of my own but by the faith of the Son of the living God who has faith and who Himself is faith to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you look at yourself, you will never find faith, but if you forget about yourself and say, O Lord Jesus, I love You, faith will immediately rise up within you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This faith is the faith of Jesus, or we may say it is Jesus believing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the phrase through faith of Jesus Christ means believing in Jesus Christ by His faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law by our believing in Jesus Christ by His faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We believe in Christ by His faith, not by our own.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Never say that you cannot believe, for you can believe if you want to.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not try to believe by yourself, because the more you try the less faith you have.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Simply say, O Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord Jesus, You are so good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do this, you will have faith immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We believe in Jesus Christ by His faith, and out of this faith and to this faith the righteousness of God is revealed to all who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>C. Meeting the Requirements of</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s Righteous Law and God s Glory</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The righteousness of God has been manifested to meet the requirements of His righteous law and His glory 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we believe in the Lord Jesus, we receive the righteousness of God which meets all the requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Romans 3 we find that the requirements of God are of two categories: the requirements of His righteousness and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul clearly mentions God s law and God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have all broken the law and we have all come short of the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, Romans 3:23 says that all have sinned and come short of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why does Paul suddenly mention the glory of God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The answer involves the propitiation cover mentioned in verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As Paul was writing this part of Romans, he probably had in his mind the picture of the ark of the testimony, especially the propitiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Upon this cover were the cherubim of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As we have already pointed out, underneath the cover was the law exposing the sinfulness of people and condemning them, and above the cover were the two cherubim representing God s glory and observing every action of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Underneath the cover was the exposing law; above the cover were the watching and observing cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The exposing and condemning law signified the requirements of God s righteousness according to the law, and the observing cherubim signified the requirements of God s glory according to the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Unless these requirements were fulfilled and God was satisfied, there was no way for sinners to contact God and for God to communicate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah for the expiating blood!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The expiating blood was sprinkled upon the propitiation cover, meeting the requirements of the righteous law and of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Propitiation is not only an action; it is a place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Propitiation is a place where God can meet with man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Paul was bold to say that this propitiation place is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has set forth Christ Jesus as a propitiation cover 3:25 , and this propitiation cover is the propitiation place where God can meet with man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This place is the Person of Jesus Christ the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although many Christians love the Lord Jesus and realize that He is so much to them, they may not know that Christ is a propitiation place where God can meet with us and where we can contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before we knew of this place, we were frightened by the thought of approaching God, but now we are no longer afraid of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Upon Christ as the propitiation cover we can meet with God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the meaning of Paul s writing in Romans 3.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He used the type of the ark with its cover to show the meaning of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this universe the Lord Jesus has been set forth as the propitiation place, and all sinners may come to meet God upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where are we today?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are on the propitiation place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We do have a position, a ground to meet with God, and God has the same ground to communicate with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Where is the law?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The law is under the propitiation cover; it is covered by the propitiating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Where is God s glory?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is above us, yet it has no claim against us because we are upon Christ as the propitiation place.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Here we are justified.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On this propitiation cover we are the same as God in His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We and God correspond to one another and are mutually approved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We approve God, and God approves us; God justifies us, and we justify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do you think it is too bold to say that we can justify God?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Romans 3:4 gives us the ground to say it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This verse says that God should be justified in His sayings and overcome when He is judged.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We can justify God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I have done this a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although I recognized that I was a sinner, I did not follow God blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I tried my best to verify His words.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Eventually, I fully approved God as being right.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not be afraid to study about God and investigate Him a little to see whether He is right.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you investigate Him, you will find that He is one thousand percent, even one million percent right.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You will justify God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On Christ as the propitiation cover, God and we mutually approve one another.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>According to our experience, it was not God who firstly approved us, but we who approved God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not know how much time God spent to convince us of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We were rebellious and said, I don t like God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We all thought this way before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Many people speak against God saying, If God is right, why are there so many poor people on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If God is right, why is there no justice among the nations?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They admit that there is God, but claim that He is not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Many of us can testify the same thing, confessing that we thought God was wrong, that He was not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, God has been patient with us, doing many things for us until He finally convinced us of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Who justified whom first?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We firstly justified God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When we were convinced by God of His righteousness, we justified Him and wept in repentance, saying, God, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I m so sinful and unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I need Your forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, we not only were put into Christ but upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now we are upon Christ as our propitiation place where God and we can justify one another.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We declare, God, You are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I have no problem with You.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Then God replies, Dear child, I have no problem with you either.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Firstly, we approved God; then God approved us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We justified God; then God justified us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>All this happened upon Christ as the propitiation place.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Under Him the law is covered and upon Him the cherubim are joyous when they see the mutual justification that occurs upon Him as the propitiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Where are we now?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We are on Jesus Christ as the propitiation place.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We are on the propitiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The law is under our feet, and the glory of God is over our head satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The law has been silenced; it can no longer speak against us, but the glory of God can rejoice over us with satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Here upon the propitiation cover we enjoy God s full justification.</S>
