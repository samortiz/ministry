<h2 class="head2">Confessing Our Wrongs</h2><p>There are many other things of a similar nature, and we cannot enumerate them all. If we are willing to be enlightened by the Lord, He will show us many unrighteous things. Once we see that we are wrong, we should not be afraid of confessing our wrong. When we first become a Christian, it is inevitable that we will make mistakes. The worst thing is being ignorant of our mistakes or refusing to admit our mistakes once we know them. Being ignorant of our mistakes is being in darkness. Sins can be forgiven, but darkness cannot be forgiven. If we confess our sins, the Lord will forgive us. But darkness makes us ignorant of our sins; therefore, we cannot enjoy forgiveness. The Lord said, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness" (John 8:12). If we do not have the light, we will not be able to tell the difference between black and white. If we are in the light, we will see what unrighteousness is and what sin is.</p><p>For a new believer, nothing is more important than knowing what unrighteousness is. For a Christian, as he grows, the most important thing is becoming more and more sensitive to unrighteousness and dealing with all unrighteousness more and more seriously.</p><p>A brother once said, "When I was first saved, I wrote a hundred letters of apology and confession the first year and another hundred the second year. In spite of that, I only knew sin but did not know unrighteousness. I knew that I had cheated, slandered, and supplanted others. These were sins, and I dealt with them. But I did not see what unrighteousness is; I did not know what it means to infringe upon the rights of others. I did not realize that I should give others what is rightfully theirs and that I should not give others what they do not deserve. Three years after I was saved, I read a story from a magazine which was about a conference that was held in a certain place. On the day of the conference, it was raining. Someone was sitting on the first row, and he put his raincoat on the back of the chair beside him. Another man was walking up to the platform to deliver his message, and he inadvertently displaced the raincoat on the front row. One sleeve of the raincoat fell to the floor, and he accidentally stepped on it with his muddy shoes. He knew what he had done, but he just kicked the sleeve aside. He delivered a very good message and others could see that he was very familiar with the Scripture. But the writer of the story remarked, `I do not care how good his message is. I just want to see what he will do to the sleeve when he comes down from the platform.' After the speaker finished his message, he kicked the sleeve aside just as he had done before and sat down. The writer of the story concluded with the words, `This is unrighteousness.' I never knew what unrighteousness was until the day I read this story. The word unrighteousness suddenly became very big to me. What is unrighteousness? Unrighteousness is trespassing on others. The man should not have stepped on the sleeve and then sat down. Even if he did not clean the sleeve, at least he should have apologized to the owner of the raincoat. For him to do such a thing was unrighteous." Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to know what unrighteousness is. Being unrighteous is crossing the boundary, trespassing against others, and causing others to suffer. God has made us His righteousness, and He has made us an expression of His righteousness to the extent that when others see us they see God's righteousness; therefore, we cannot be unrighteous in our daily living.</p><h2 class="head1">PETITION AND EXHORTATION</h2><p>Finally, I should add a few words. In regard to ourselves, we have to be righteous. But when we see others being unrighteous, we have to pray for them. The hardest thing for us to take is seeing others practicing unrighteousness while we are practicing righteousness. We may feel indignant and angry. We may want to cut them off and ignore them, but this is useless. We have to realize that they need light just as we do. Before we see the light, we also will not realize our mistakes. If our brother or sister is unrighteous, we cannot brush them aside, ignore them, reject them, or cut them off. We have to pray for them and ask God to give them the light to see. It is useless for us to see the light alone; they have to see the light also. We have to learn to petition on behalf of others and learn to speak the truth in love. At the same time, we have to deal with ourselves in a strict way. We have to remember that we are God's righteousness on earth today. In our daily living, we have to express God as the righteous God. Only then will others give praise and glory to our God. May God make every one of us a righteous person. God's salvation is righteous. May we express God's righteousness on earth by realizing His righteousness, and may we express this righteousness in everything.</p>
