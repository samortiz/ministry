Why do we need to consider the matter of authority? First, we must know that God's acts are based upon His throne, and His throne is built on authority. All things were created through God's authority. All natural laws function according to God's authority. God did not create the universe with power, but with authority. He does not uphold the natural laws by power, but by authority. Scientists today have discovered atomic power. Actually, what they have discovered is God's power. Their discovery is merely an unveiling of the laws of nature. According to Hebrews 1:3 God upholds all things by His word, which relates to His authority. God upholds all things by His authority, not by His power. God's authority ensures the constancy of the natural laws in this universe. He created the universe with His authority, and He rules the universe with His authority. God's authority represents God Himself. Looking at the matter in another way, we can say that God is the embodiment of authority. God is also the embodiment of power; He is the embodiment of authority as well as power. It is easy for man to be forgiven when he only offends God's power. It is not easy for him to be forgiven if he offends God's authority. It is a serious thing for a man to offend God's authority. Brothers and sisters, we have to see that authority is the unchanging factor that rules and stabilizes the universe from the beginning of time to its end. Everything in the universe, from the highest design to the lowest form, is upheld by God's authority. From creation, only one thing involves man all the time&mdash;authority.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF SATAN</h2><p>Satan became who he is through offending God's authority. Satan is not the one who wrestled with God, but the one who trespassed against His authority. He tried to establish his own throne and rebelled against God's authority and throne. This caused him to become Satan. Isaiah 13 and 14 tell us that Satan wanted to establish his throne above God's throne. This is how he became Satan. The cause of his fall was his challenge of God's authority. He fell and became Satan not only because he committed the many sins spoken of in Ezekiel 28; the root of Satan's sin was his rebellion against God's authority. Satan did not sin and then rebel against God's authority; rather, he trespassed against God's authority and then fell and sinned. He fell because of his trespass against God's authority. This is the principle of Satan's operation&mdash;transgression against God's authority.</p><h2 class="head1">IT BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO SERVE GOD<br />IN THE PRINCIPLE OF SATAN</h2><p>This shows us clearly that in order to serve God, we cannot trespass His authority. Once we do, we fall under Satan's principle. Either we do not serve God at all or we have to come to terms with the vital place of authority. The first thing we should touch is authority, because authority is the basic rule upon which God governs the universe. We can never harbor any satanic principle of rebellion against authority within us while outwardly serving God. If a man has never been delivered from this satanic principle and if there is still a vestige within him of the principle which led to Satan's enmity against God, the principle which led to Satan's very rebellion, we can never serve God. We can never preach the word of Christ in the principle of Satan. Principle is more important than words. In this universe Satan is not afraid of those who preach Christ's word; he is afraid of those who submit to Christ's authority. Satan is still lodging in the air today. He is rebellious and blasphemous. He should have been cast out of heaven into the bottomless pit already, but he is lingering until the church will obey Christ. This will happen at the end of Revelation. Then Satan will be completely defeated. However, we have to rid ourselves of Satan's principle today. If a man has not rid himself of Satan's principle, he can only preach Satan's word; he cannot preach the word of Christ. Unless God's authority and our submission are fully manifested, we can make many claims about doing God's work, but we are doing Satan's work in actuality. For example, a man may have been in Chungking (the seat of the Chinese government) during the last war, but he may have been working for Nanking (the headquarters of the Japanese occupying army). Submission to authority is a matter of principle, while preaching is merely a matter of work. Principle is more important than work. We have to settle the matter of principle here.</p><p>In Matthew 6:13a the Lord taught the disciples to pray, "Do not bring us into temptation." He does not want to see us falling because of temptation. He also said, "Deliver us from the evil one" (v. 13b). Temptation refers to Satan's work, while the evil one refers to Satan himself. The Lord wants us to pray to be delivered from Satan's work as well as from Satan himself. We pray for God's deliverance from these two things: Satan's work and Satan himself. Following this we read, "For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever" (v. 13c). We have to ask God to deliver us from temptation and ask Him to deliver us from Satan himself because the kingdom, the authority, and the glory are all the Lord's; they do not belong to Satan. In this universe, the unique controversy between Satan and God is the matter of authority. The Lord wants us to pray to be delivered from Satan and his work. We must not fall under Satan's authority or his principle. The kingdom, the authority, and the glory are all God's; they do not belong to Satan. This is the reason we have to be delivered from temptation and from the evil one. There are three basic things in the universe: the kingdom, the authority, and the glory. The kingdom belongs to God. So do the authority and the glory. None of these three things belong to Satan. The kingdom of the world today, the authority of the universe, and the glory of all things to come are not altogether the Lord's yet. However, the day will come when the kingdom, authority, and glory will be God's. Today in the church we should take back authority from Satan. We do not recognize the many kingdoms on the earth today. We only recognize the kingdom of the heavens. We have to be under God's rule. We should only acknowledge God's authority. We cannot rob His glory. All glory should go to God.</p><p>If you are here to pick up a teaching about authority, you are in the wrong place. Instead, you must pick up the proper sense&mdash;the sense of God's authority. You have to touch His authority and submit to it. Everything depends on whether or not you are under God's authority. You may have done many good works, but they do not mean much. God cares about your submission to His authority. The controversy in the universe involves the principle of authority. The entire issue today is who has the authority: God or Satan. Satan established his authority through rebelling against God's authority. This is Satan's government. Are we under Satan's government or are we under God's government? This is the crux of the whole issue.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
