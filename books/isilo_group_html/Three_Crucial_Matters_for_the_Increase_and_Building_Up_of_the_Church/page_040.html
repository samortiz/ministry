<p>Our present need is to obtain a large meeting hall. Our numbers are constantly increasing, and even though we emphasize home meetings, we still need corporate meetings at least once a month. Sometimes the whole church will need to gather together to take care of a need. A few years ago we obtained some property at Linkou and began preparations to build a large meeting hall there. We spoke of the purchase of the property at Linkou in a general way at the end of 1984. After two years of applying for the property, we finally received a formal response from the government. We then had another meeting with the saints, but because we did not want this to be a financial burden on the saints, we gave the example of the meeting hall of the church in Pingtung and asked the saints to make contributions for the building of the meeting hall at Linkou. The saints were happy to receive the burden and made offerings. This enabled us to purchase the property quickly. This piece of land is in a government-protected area for a flood control plan. Therefore, we must wait until the city of Linkou is developed, its population has increased, and the government has completed the flood prevention work before we receive a building permit. This means that we will not obtain a building permit in the near future and that we must temporarily leave that piece of property for later development. We now know that it is difficult to purchase inexpensive land in the outlying areas to build a large meeting hall. Therefore, we must build a large hall within the city of Taipei, but the price of land in the city is high. In order to buy six square feet in the eastern district of Taipei, we need NT$400,000 to $500,000. Thus, this matter must be carried out according to the leading of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING TRAINED AND COORDINATING<br />
IN ONE ACCORD TO KNOCK ON DOORS<br />
AND TO CARE FOR NEW ONES</h2>
<p>If we want to gospelize Taiwan, our first step must be to gain the city of Taipei. The meeting halls continue to set up small meetings in the communities. When there are fifteen to twenty &ldquo;small hall&rdquo; meetings in a community, we can find a hall to meet in. There is a place in Taipei with four hundred saints who were saved through door-knocking. One hundred of these new ones come to the meetings regularly, and another thirty meet regularly in a sister&rsquo;s home. The meeting in the sister&rsquo;s home is just like a meeting in a small hall. There are more than ten meetings like this one that can be called community or district meetings. If we continue step by step, these small hall meetings may eventually establish a regular meeting in a hall.</p>
<p>If possible, it is good for the brothers and sisters to attend the training. If they are not able to attend during the day, they will still receive much benefit from attending the training at night. We need to be trained in everything we do. It is difficult for a person who is not trained to play the piano well. This also applies to sports. We have been practicing the new way for more than two years, and most of the churches around the world are practicing the new way. However, the success of knocking on doors depends on whether the elders are in one accord. If the elders and the saints who knock on doors are in one accord, there will be results.</p>
<p>The elderly brothers and sisters who have been in the church life for many years are experienced, and they have a heart to knock on doors. We hope that when they go out door-knocking, they will stand before the door, in front of the trainees, so that people will feel comfortable to open their doors. However, when it is time to preach the gospel, it is best to let the young people speak, and the older saints should be there to comfort people&rsquo;s hearts and to pray. In this way their function will be effective. Even though the young people cannot compare to the elderly saints in experience and eloquence, the young people who have been trained can calmly meet the need. For example, I was not trained to play the piano; therefore, I cannot play as well as my young granddaughter, even though I have been around pianos from my youth. The elderly brothers and sisters who knock on doors with the trainees should receive this exhortation to stand before the door but to not open their mouths to preach the gospel. When the young people come to the crucial point in the gospel, the elderly saints should not interrupt, even if they fear that the young saints will not do a good job. Any interruption can prevent a person from being saved. Furthermore, even though the young people may speak quickly or may not be so polite, the elderly saints must not become angry. Similarly, the young people should not resent any criticism from the elderly saints. We must not overly emphasize being correct in our speech or being polite. As long as people are saved and baptized, it is very precious.</p>
<p>If all the brothers and sisters pick up this burden, we will not need to spend time on other problems. May the gospel run freely, may people be saved, and may the Lord have a way to go on. We must gospelize Taipei, then Taiwan, and then the entire world. May we all receive this commission.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Crucial Matters for the Increase and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
