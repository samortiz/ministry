<h2 class="head2">A Psalm</h2>
<p>Our speaking in the apostles&rsquo; teaching according to the practice at Paul&rsquo;s time can be by a psalm, a teaching, a revelation (1 Cor. 14:26), an exhortation (Heb. 10:25), or an admonition (Col. 3:16). Paul lists a psalm, a teaching, and a revelation in 1 Corinthians 14:26. A psalm is a poetic piece according to the teaching of the apostles. A part of the apostles&rsquo; teaching put into poetry by the saints is a psalm. Psalms are long poems, hymns are shorter ones, and spiritual songs are the shortest. In our hymnal, a few hymns may be considered as psalms (#187 has twenty-six verses and #188 has twenty-two verses). The longest psalm in the Bible is Psalm 119, which is composed in twenty-two sections according to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Each letter covers eight verses for a total of one hundred and seventy-six verses. Our singing a psalm is called psalming. We need to learn to psalm a psalm.</p>
<p>Many saints have composed poetical pieces, but we must remember that in composing a psalm, hymn, or spiritual song we are not trying to say something strange or funny. We must compose poetry full of dignity and full of weight that takes care of the rhythm and rhyme. Poetry without the proper rhyme is unacceptable. I composed over two hundred hymns in our hymnal, but since 1964 I have written hardly any hymns. I hope that some of the saints would be raised up and burdened by the Lord to continue to write hymns. Since 1964 we have received much new light from the Word, and there are many new points that need some hymns to express them.</p>
<p>In our meetings, we must have some psalms, not only for psalming but also for speaking. I hope that in every meeting at least one-fourth of the speaking would be speaking on psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. A hymn, like the cream of milk, is the cream of a certain composition. The best way for us to learn how to speak is to learn how to speak with the hymns. We should learn to use a hymn like &ldquo;O Glorious Christ, Savior Mine&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #501). That hymn will help us in speaking, but we have to learn to speak in a living way, in a very refreshing way, and in a very inspiring way. We should not just read the hymns, but speak in a Way to stir up the saints and inspire every attendant of the meeting. We need to practice speaking the hymns in this way again and again. Then we will be equipped to render much help to the meeting. We can have a very good Lord&rsquo;s table meeting just by speaking one hymn. After speaking this hymn, we can sing it, and after singing it, we can speak it again. We would not need to call another hymn. By singing, speaking, singing, and speaking one hymn, the riches of Christ will be released into the meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Glorious Christ, Savior Mine&rdquo; has seven verses with many rich and high points. How could we express something of these points by our instant speaking? It is impossible. That hymn was written with much consideration in the spirit, and it was improved and recomposed again and again. I wrote this hymn in 1961 in Taipei, and many can testify that it is really hard to make any improvement to the Chinese version. The expressions have been refined to the uttermost. If we could get ourselves into these expressions and learn to speak them, that would be marvelous. How good it would be if we could speak with the language of such a hymn in the meeting rather than speaking our own word.</p>
<p>I have rarely seen a meeting with good speaking on certain hymns because we have not spent the time to teach and train the saints in this practice. All the saints in the churches have to learn to speak with the hymns and on the hymns. I am planning to study this matter when I return to Taipei. We hope to find out all the secrets concerning the speaking of hymns. Then we will present what we have found to all the saints. The New Testament through the Apostle Paul tells us twice that we need to speak the hymns to each other (Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16).</p>
