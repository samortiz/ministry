<p>Now we have to ask: Whose mind is this? It is difficult to say, because now the Spirit is mingled with your spirit, and the Spirit here is interceding within you. In our groaning, there is the groaning of the Spirit. The Spirit groans in our groaning. Even we can say that it is the Spirit&rsquo;s groaning groaned by us, uttered by us. So it is actually our groaning. In the same principle, it is the Spirit&rsquo;s mind, but now the Spirit&rsquo;s mind is one with our mind, because our mind is set on the spirit. Doctrine cannot help you much to understand these matters. Only by experience can you understand these matters because they are too subjective. Anything related to life, even the physical life, is subjective.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have the burden to pray, yet we don&rsquo;t know what to say. At such a time we may groan, &ldquo;O Lord, O Lord.&rdquo; This is our groaning because it is uttered by us, yet that groan begins with the mingled spirit. It begins in our spirit and comes out of the depth of our being. That was not merely a sound of groaning. Within the groaning there was a kind of mind because there was a kind of thought or kind of meaning in it. This means the mind is involved, but what kind of mind or whose mind is that? It is the Spirit&rsquo;s mind, but it is not merely the Spirit&rsquo;s mind, but the Spirit&rsquo;s mind mingled with our mind. Our mind is set on the spirit, making our mind itself one with the Spirit&rsquo;s mind. Only the Lord knows what kind of mind this is.</p>
<p>The Bible is really a book of puzzles. For example, in verse 27, it says that He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit. Whose heart is mentioned here? Surely this is not the heart of the Spirit; this must be our heart. God searches our heart, yet He knows what is the mind of the Spirit. This proves to us that the Spirit here is not the independent mind of the Spirit; it is the mind of the Spirit mingled with our mind and becoming a part of our heart. It is our heart and the Spirit&rsquo;s mind. God searching our heart knows the mind of the Spirit. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful! This tells us one thing: our mind is one with the Spirit. The Spirit&rsquo;s mind is one with our mind, and our mingled mind even has become a part of our heart. The Bible&rsquo;s revelation gives us a clear view of such a mingling. Our mind could be set on the spirit making our mind one with the Spirit. So the Spirit&rsquo;s mind is one with our mind, and this mingled heart, this mingled mind, becomes a part of our spirit. When we groan, our groaning is not a kind of religious prayer, but an aspiration from the depths of our being where the mingling of divinity with humanity is.</p>
<p>If we are experiencing such an operation within us, how could the law of the Spirit of life not function? Surely the law of the Spirit of life would spontaneously function within us. This operation fulfills the requirement of the law of the Spirit of life to work by principle, freeing us from the law of sin and death.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_117.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_119.html">Next</a> </body></html>
