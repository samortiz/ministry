To Dispense the Lord's Divine Element<br>in His Resurrection Life<br>into His Believers' Inward Element</H2><P>The transformation of the renewed believers is by the dispensing of the Lord's divine element in His resurrection life into His believers' inward element. We do have a natural element, and this natural element is not altogether evil. Because Christ's redemption has dealt with the evil element, our natural element is a redeemed element. Into such a redeemed element the divine element is now being dispensed. When the divine element is added into our redeemed and uplifted natural element, we are sanctified and renewed. The result is that we are metabolically transformed, and the image of the resurrected Lord in the glory of His divine life is formed in us.</P><P>Christians are not a group of working people but a group of eating and enjoying people. We Christians need to learn to keep ourselves away from work. We should stay away from the "office," the place of work, and come back "home" to eat and enjoy. The teaching in today's Christianity produces a group of working people. Husbands are taught to love their wives, and wives are taught to submit to their husbands. It is possible to pick up hundreds of commandments in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. Brother Nee once said that any teaching that helps us to work is wrong, but any teaching that ushers us into Christ for enjoyment is right. We do not need to work for transformation, but we need to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord in resurrection. Then some element from Him will be dispensed into us and be absorbed by us. He dispenses, and we absorb Him, the very processed and consummated Triune God, as the life-giving, compound, indwelling Spirit into our being. Then, we praise Him with hallelujahs all the day long. If we praise our Lord all day long, we will be blessed; we will be an enjoying people.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_162.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_164.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Line of the Divine Revelation &nbsp; pg 163</div><br></body></html>
