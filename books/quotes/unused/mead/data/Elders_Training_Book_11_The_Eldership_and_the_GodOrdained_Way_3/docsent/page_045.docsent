   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>You could even save your time by arranging to have a ten minute morning watch with each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The telephone may be used for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One person can be scheduled at 6:15 a.m., the next person at 6:30, and the next person at 6:45.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Within one hour, you could contact three persons in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You could contact the same three persons every morning to pray-read with them, fellowship with them, and enjoy Christ with them in a very brief way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Within three months each person can be contacted at least eighty times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After three months of this kind of consistent contact, these ones can be gained for the Lord's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Logically speaking, this practice works, but will we do it?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course, when we endeavor to have morning watch with other brothers, we should ask them what time will be convenient for them, and try to fit into their schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should restrict our time with them in the morning to pray-reading the Word and having a little fellowship about the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This practice will enrich us and the ones for whom we are caring.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, we will gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After many years of study, I can tell you that it is not necessary to go out to knock on many doors in our labor for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should practice selecting and taking care of three people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should go to see each of them at least once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not need to talk too much, and we should not be hurried to baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we went to Taipei in 1986, we were experimenting to find the most effective way to preach the gospel and gain people for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We found out that we should not baptize people so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mainly we need to go to visit them again and again, week by week.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we visit them, we should not speak too much of the truth to them, nor should we try to gain them in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We just need to go to them continually.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we visit a person consistently for three months, that will work out a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we will gain the real and remaining fruit yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To take care of three persons in this way for a year is not too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, this is very fast.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If one-third of the saints in a locality practiced this, the church there could double within a year.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not need to worry about what to say when we visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The main thing we need to do is visit them and contact them consistently.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope that we would take this charge to visit people consistently.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may feel that this is too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we cannot contact three persons every day, at least we can see them once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After three months, we will have contacted each person twelve times.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We will see a positive result from this kind of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I want to say again that we should not try to be that quick, looking for quick results.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, we should visit people consistently over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps we would not read The Mystery of Human Life with someone until we have visited them three times.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fast way does not work well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The slow way works successfully if we persevere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we continue to visit three persons three times a week, we will see something happen positively.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we want to see our church increased, we must practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For the preaching of the gospel, the feeding of the new believers, and the perfecting of the saints, we must visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A proper elder, a top elder, must be a person who practices visiting people regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may feel that we do not know how to perfect people, but we all can go to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should focus our attention on going to see people and letting them see us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This practice will bring in the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because I love the churches, I am concerned for their increase.</S>
