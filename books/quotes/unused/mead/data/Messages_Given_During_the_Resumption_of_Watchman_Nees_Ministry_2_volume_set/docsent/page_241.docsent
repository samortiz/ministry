   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STILL A HANDFUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here is another hymn:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Anxious one, why hold that handful?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let the prophet first be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Your finances, if God handles,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can your supply run dry?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fresh necessities come daily,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Daily there are fresh supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since you are His own creation,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Will He not for you design?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Still you're loving, and still giving,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Still there is a handful left.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For all love and all your giving,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many-fold He'll give you more.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>O believe!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He'll not delay you,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ne'er too quick is He, nor slow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>O believe!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The cruse, ne'er empty,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nor will it be dry, nor filled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Though the lilies lack their clothing,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Though the birds may not have food,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet the widow's little barrel,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Always has a handful still.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why need worry for tomorrow,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When there's now enough to share?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Why need borrow next day's trouble,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we have our handful still?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Love is living; giving's saving;</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who sow much reap much more.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you think that all is emptied,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Look, there is a handful still.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This hymn is based on the story in 1 Kings 17.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our concept we do not care for the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We think that taking care of the prophet is God's problem, God's business.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But here the prophet is put into the hymn, which means that the prophet is also the business of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who have not handed over themselves will worry what to do next.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But once you have handed over yourselves, you will see that God is responsible for the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We give the first half to the prophet, and God gives the second half to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This hymn is God's answer for the second half.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, though the widow supplied the prophet first, she herself did not suffer hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All she did was to pour the oil a few more times, and to empty the meal a few more times.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God said that the first handful should be set aside for His use, and the second handful set aside for her own use.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The third handful is again for God's use, and the fourth handful for her own use.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first, third, fifth, seventh, and so forth, are for God, and the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and so forth, take care of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the widow did not have faith, she might say, "Here is a person who has been starving for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What if he helps himself to it and eats up all my portion?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, if we would give the first portion to God, God will give the second portion to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The same principle applies to our daily living today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God will not allow our cruse to be lacking in oil, or our barrel to be lacking in meal.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But neither will He allow us to have an excess.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, we see that there is no need to save up anything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The second stanza is quite high.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It starts out with the word "believe."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You should believe.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What should we believe in?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should believe that at no time will we be empty, and at no time will we be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is always a handful left.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we have much, we may still worry that we do not have enough.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But God gives to us in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet He does not give everything to us all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead He gives to us handful by handful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The third stanza tells us that we should look to God concerning what He wants to do tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For all those who give, the result will actually be saving.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we spend, we think that what is spent is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Actually, nothing will be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No one will find himself giving to God to such an extent that he has nothing left.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If the widow had not committed herself to God, she would not have lived through that three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today, man's eyes are always set on the money in his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In 1 Timothy 6, the warning Paul gave was a despairing warning.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He exhorted the believers not to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The best exhortation tells people to set their hope in God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But when the best exhortation no longer works, we have the next best kind of exhortation, which tells people not to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But no matter how much a man sets his hope on the uncertainty of riches, in the end he still has to turn around to set his hope on God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since that is the case, why not set one's hope in God in the first place?</S>
