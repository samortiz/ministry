<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>36. The One Empowering Us</H2><P>Christ also is the One who empowers us. In Philippians 4:13 Paul said, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me." To be empowered is to be made dynamic inwardly. Christ dwells in us (Col. 1:27). He empowers us, makes us dynamic from within, not from without. By such inward empowering Paul was able to do all things in Christ.</P><P>Paul was a person in Christ (2 Cor. 12:2), and he desired to be found in Christ by others. Now he declared that he was able to do all things in Him, the very Christ who empowered him. This is an all-inclusive and concluding word of his experience of Christ. It is the converse of the Lord's word concerning our organic union with Him in John 15:5: "Apart from Me you can do nothing." According to Philippians 4, we know that what is spoken of here, that we are able to do all things in Christ, the One who empowers us, refers to our being able to live a contented life (vv. 11-12) and to live out the human virtues of Christ, such as to be true, to be dignified, to be righteous, to be pure, to be lovely, and to be well spoken of (v. 8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>Christ is the One who lives in us that we may live Him. He is not only life to us, the believers, but also a person living in us. His living in us is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit. Now we live because of Him by eating Him. Furthermore, we practice living Him in every detail of our life that we may be found in Him. He lives within us as our life, and we live Him without as His expression. Christ is also the One who is being formed in us. First, He was born into us, then He lives in us, and, finally, He will be formed in us at our maturity. Christ as the living One with His element is becoming organically the constituent within us that constitutes our entire being that we may have His form to express His image. He is also the One who makes His home in our hearts. He desires to dwell deeply in our entire being. He not only comes into our spirit but also spreads into every part of our heart, that He may control and occupy our entire inward being and that He may supply, strengthen, and saturate our every inward part with Himself. Thus, we are filled with Him unto all the fullness of God as God's corporate expression. Christ is also the One who is magnified in us. When we live Christ, express Christ, and display Christ's unlimited greatness, Christ is made great in others' eyes and is seen and realized as the One who is unlimited. He is also the One who empowers us. Christ dwells in us to empower us that we may be able to do all things in Him and to have a contented life and a life that lives out the human virtues of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>How does Christ live in us, and how can we live Him?</li><li>Briefly explain the significance of Christ's being formed in us.</li><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ's making His home in our hearts.</li><li>What does it mean to magnify Christ?</li><li>Briefly state the significance of our being able to do all things in Christ, the One who empowers us.</li></ol>
