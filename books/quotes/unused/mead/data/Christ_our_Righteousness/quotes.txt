[1]  Now we want to consider the difference between the righteousness of Christ and Christ as our righteousness.
[2]  But the Bible does not say that we are saved by the righteousness of Christ or that the righteousness of Christ has become our righteousness.
[3]  Only when we come to Romans 6 do we see that we are joined to Him in the likeness of His death and resurrection v. 5 . Therefore, a Christian does not become righteous in the eyes of God through the righteousness of Christ, but through Christ Himself.
[4]  Christ Himself has become our righteousness, and we can come to God at any time because Christ lives forever.
[5]  The robe of righteousness is a good illustration, yet it is not a perfect illustration.
[6]  It will not change in another twenty years because my righteousness is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[7]  I can advance in holiness, but I cannot advance in my righteousness, because the righteousness that God has given me is already perfect.
