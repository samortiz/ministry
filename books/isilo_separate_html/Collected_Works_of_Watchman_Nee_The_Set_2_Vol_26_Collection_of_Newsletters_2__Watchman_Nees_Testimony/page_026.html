May the Father God pour out His rich grace upon you and all your work. May His grace and peace always be with you and with the brothers and sisters in the Lord in every place. Glory to the Lord forever. Amen.</p><p>My dear brother, Wang Yu T'ing, was led by the Father God in March to go to the meetings in the Lord in Ya Yang, Tai Shun to do some work (a five-day conference). He also fellowshipped with the brothers and discussed the Lord's way. He stayed there for a month. The work was very blessed. The messages and testimonies were very effective. We should praise the Lord. In the past few months, he has been at Ting Pu T'ou resting in their meeting place. He also hopes to spend some time there to do some publication work. Unfortunately, in these past months, his body became unexpectedly weaker, and he was sick inwardly and outwardly. He is often in pain. In the beginning of May and June, his life was in danger twice. This was Satan using his dark army and his authority of death to attack him fiercely. During those times, he almost died, but the special grace and care of the Lord carried him through. God had mercy on him and not only on him, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow among all these dangers and problems. He has now overcome the illness by the Lord Christ's victorious resurrection power, which swallows up death. It is difficult for him not to feel exhausted in both heart and body after such a long fight at the brink of death. A few days ago, some brothers came to say that he was better, but that he was not back to normal. He still does not have an appetite, and he needs much rest. The responsibility he has is quite crucial at the present time. He would really appreciate the dear brothers and sisters in the Lord and you praying for him.</p><p>I have another brother in the Lord who hopes you will pray for him much. He hopes you will help him with the light of the truth so that he will know how he should serve the Lord single-heartedly. He wants to be one who obeys and is praised by the Lord. The brother's environment and all his business have had a sudden change since he was enlightened. Then his trials began. His troubles continued to come. He is oppressed even today and surrounded by attacks. All the persecution, opposition, criticism, scorn, and suffering from sickness, etc., rarely stop. (Thank the Lord that His grace is sufficient! Amen!) But is this situation from God the Father's discipline or from the attack of the enemy? I ask you brothers to give us some guidance. He still does not know which way to go though he has considered for a long time. He says that  he does not have the strength to farm, and he has not received a clear revelation to go into business; furthermore, he is afraid that if he moves loosely, he will fall into sin. I hope you do not drop this problem but use the light of the Holy Spirit to guide him so that he will know God's will and how to go ahead, and that he will not just stand around watching and spend the entire day empty-handed. Please ask the brothers and sisters who love the Lord to pray for him often so that he may overcome to glorify the Lord's name.</p><p>The brothers and sisters in the meeting here&mdash;Ch'iao Tun&mdash;have been blessed with peace in this year. There have been several newly saved and baptized brothers who were added to us. Thank and praise the Lord! We now feel that we are too immature in our spiritual life. We also feel poor in the gifts. Our meeting place is very small, dilapidated, and noisy. In the future, if the Lord's grace does not prepare a way to enlarge it, we feel it will not be enough for our use and will hinder the Lord's work. With regard to the meetings near to us, the brothers and sisters are all at peace in the Lord. But their gifts of administration and offerings and their gospel work are lacking. Please do not forget to pray for us. Peace in the Lord. Greet all the brothers and sisters!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Wu Sheng</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
