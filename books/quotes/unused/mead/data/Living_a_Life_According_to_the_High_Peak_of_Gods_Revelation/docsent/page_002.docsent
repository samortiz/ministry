   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE FULFILLMENT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT OF THE TYPOLOGY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT CONCERNING GOD'S ECONOMY 1 THE PICTURE AND THE DEFINITION OF GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see the fulfillment in the New Testament of the typology in the Old Testament concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is in the Old Testament is a typology, a set of types.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then what is in the New Testament is a complete fulfillment of that typology concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, the entire Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, is first a picture of God's economy and then a full definition and fulfillment of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, if we want to know the Old Testament, we must come to the New Testament definition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament, we can see only the pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, if we want to know the New Testament, we have to spend the time to look at all these pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Saint Augustine said that the New Testament is concealed in the Old Testament, and the Old Testament is unveiled in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So these two sections are on the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In today's schools the good lesson books have pictures and then definitions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The pictures and the definitions form a strong basic principle for us to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you do not know this principle, you will create mixture and confusion from the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Two groups of Christians those in the Catholic Church and those in Pentecostalism are the top "experts," "specialists," in mixing up the Old Testament with the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Pentecostal movement, they sing a lot of Bible verses.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the verses they sing are from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ephesians is a top book and Romans is a basic book in the New Testament, but they do not sing verses from these books.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They sing mostly from the Psalms or from Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is because the Pentecostal people do not know God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They miss the New Testament definition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They like some of the Old Testament pictures without understanding them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, they like to look at the pictures; they do not like to read the definitions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you look at a picture without the proper definition, you may consider a lion as a tiger or a turtle as a mouse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Pentecostals' expounding of the Bible is a mixture because they do not have the proper definitions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the same in principle with the practices of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The clothing of the cardinals and archbishops is a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mostly their robes are made according to the style of the robes of the Aaronic priests in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the early years of my Christian life, I was with the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were famous for understanding the Old Testament types and prophecies, and I received much knowledge from them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The great teachers among the Brethren said that the entire history of Israel was a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without this understanding, we cannot explain the significance of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These books are a record of the return of the children of Israel from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The teaching of the Brethren strongly stressed that the captivity of Israel into Babylon typifies the church which was captured into Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even the Lord Jesus pointed this out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus referred to the Roman Catholic Church as Jezebel Rev 2:20; Matt 13:33 and also as the Great Babylon, a mystery Rev 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The entire Catholic Church is a mystery in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Brethren saw that Israel's captivity typified the church's captivity and that the return of Israel typified the recovery of the church starting from Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a call in the book of Revelation to come out of Babylon, to come out of the Catholic Church 18:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although the Brethren saw this, they did not see that the history of the kings in the Old Testament was a typology of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, not one of the great teachers of the Brethren saw the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They did not even use this term.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They somewhat used another term to replace God's economy, that is, God's plan or God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The English word economy is anglicized from the Greek word oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But who knows today what God's economy is?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When most think of an economy, they think of it in terms of dollars and cents.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not mean this when we speak of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's economy is God's plan, God's divine arrangement, for the fulfillment of His good pleasure in His will to be His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Israel's history was not only a type of the entire church, as the Brethren teachers pointed out, but also a type of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fulfillment of this economy is in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Testament presents us the complete fulfillment of the typology of the kings in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, there is the typology in the Old Testament and the fulfillment in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One is the picture, and the other is the definition.</S>
