IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Hebrews says that we should enter into the Holy of Holies (10:19) and that we should come forward to the throne of grace (4:16). In order to understand what this means, we must know the types in the Old Testament. The first section of both the tabernacle and the temple was the outer court. After passing through the outer court, a person entered the second section, the Holy Place. The innermost section of both the tabernacle and the temple was called the Holy of Holies. Inside the Holy of Holies was the Ark, and the lid of the Ark was called the expiation cover (Exo. 25:17, 21). The law was inside the Ark (v. 16). Every year on the Day of Expiation the blood of the sin offering was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled upon the expiation cover of the Ark (Lev. 16). The expiation cover on the Ark in the Holy of Holies equals the throne of grace. This is where God gives grace to man, meets with man, abides with man, and speaks with man (Exo. 25:22). This is the type in the Old Testament.</p>

IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The types in the Old Testament are depictions of New Testament realities. Some Bible scholars say that the Holy of Holies refers to heaven, where the Lord is today. Although this is not wrong, the New Testament shows that the Holy of Holies is in us. First Corinthians says that the believers are the temple of God (3:16; 6:19). God&rsquo;s temple has three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. Our body can be likened to the outer court, our soul can be likened to the Holy Place, and our spirit, the deepest part of our being, can be likened to the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The Ark, which typifies Christ, is in the Holy of Holies. This signifies that the Lord Jesus Christ is in our spirit. The Holy of Holies refers to our spirit, and the throne of grace is Christ, the place where we meet with God.</p>
<p>When someone in the Old Testament wanted to fellowship with God, he went to the temple. The temple had three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. The Ark, which was inside the Holy of Holies, was the place where God appeared to man. God did not dwell in the outer court or in the Holy Place. God dwelt in the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>The Lord is with us; He dwells in us. In which part of our being does the Lord dwell? Does He dwell in our body, our soul, or our spirit? Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; The Lord is in our spirit. Hence, if we want to draw near to Him, we must be in our spirit. Our spirit is the Holy of Holies, where God dwells.</p>

AND COMING TO THE THRONE OF GRACE<br />
BY TURNING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Suppose I live with a brother, and there is friction between us. Perhaps I think that he is always impolite and that he should not be so rude to me. When I remember the things that he has done to me, I am turning to my mind. Eventually, my emotion is stirred up so that I become unhappy. The more I remember the things he has done to me, the unhappier I become. When I become angry, my will is in turmoil. However, since I am a believer, I can pray in the morning in order to draw near to the Lord. When I touch the Lord, I turn to my spirit. The more I contact the Lord in my spirit, the more I am saved from my mind and also from my emotions. By touching the Lord and being enlightened by Him, I am saved from rebuking my brother. This illustration shows that our spirit is the Holy of Holies. Whenever we turn to our spirit, we are in the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament not everyone could enter into the Holy of Holies. Not only were the Levites not allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, but even the priests were not allowed to enter the Holy of Holies. Only the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies (Heb. 9:7). Therefore, when we turn to our spirit, we are one with the High Priest. There are many Levites who are doing outward activities, but we should turn to our spirit. When we want to argue with someone, we should tell the devil, &ldquo;I will not fall into your trap. I will not follow you in outward activities. I will enter into the Holy of Holies.&rdquo; I hope that this will not become doctrine among us. May it become our experience.</p>
<p>The Lord is not merely our Savior, nor is He merely the Lord of all sitting on the throne. Today He is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. In order for us to be Christians, it is not enough for us merely to worship Him outwardly. In order to experience the Lord, we must turn to our spirit. The Lord is the Spirit, and He is in our spirit. &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17). The Lord is the Spirit, and we also have a spirit. Moreover, the Spirit is in our spirit. Therefore, we can experience the Lord. These two spirits&mdash;our spirit and the Spirit&mdash;have become one spirit. This mingled spirit is the place where we can experience, contact, and enjoy the Lord.</p>
<p>The cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood that He shed for our redemption gives us the ground to be one with the High Priest. Even a new believer can enter into the Holy of Holies, into his spirit. Every time we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies where we can touch the Lord. The Lord is the Ark, and the cover of the Ark is the throne of grace. This is where God gives grace and where we can receive grace. Hence, we should come forward continually to the throne of grace in order to receive mercy and find grace for timely help (Heb. 4:16).</p>
