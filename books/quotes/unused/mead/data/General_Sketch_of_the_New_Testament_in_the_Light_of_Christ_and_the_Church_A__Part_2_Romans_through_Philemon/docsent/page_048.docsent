   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN CRUCIAL POINTS CONCERNING THE CHURCH IN EPHESIANS Scripture Reading: Eph 2:1-6; 4:24; 5:22 6:9; 6:10-20; 1:3, 17; 2:22; 3:16; 4:23; 5:18 THE MATERIALS FOR THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we saw the first three main points in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fourth main point is that this book shows us the real condition and nature of the materials for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the entire Scriptures there is no other book which reveals this as inclusively and deeply as this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In their origin, the materials for the church were sinners, dead in sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is revealed clearly in Ephesians 2:1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our nature was sinful, and we were dead in sins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The phrase dead in sins may be illustrated by a person who drowns; that person is dead in water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The water and this dead person become one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The person is in the water, the water is in that person, and the water buries that person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may even say that this person is mingled with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The original condition and nature of each one of us is that we were in sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sin, just like the death waters, joined to us, buried us, and mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second, we were not only sinners but also enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were rebels joined to and filled with the enemy of God, Satan vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Satan, the ruler of the authority of the air, operated in the sons of disobedience, making us not only sinners according to God's righteousness but also rebels according to God's government and administration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were rebels joined together with Satan, and we were filled with him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, we were one with the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was our twofold condition and nature before we became the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even in Romans the apostle Paul did not reveal our original situation and condition so all-inclusively and deeply as in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Romans we are not told that we were dead in sins; we are only told that we were sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Neither does Romans tell us that we were rebels.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians tells us that we were not only sinful but dead in sins, and not only sinners but rebels joined as one with God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How marvelous it is that from such materials as these God produced the church!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We praise God that in His great love He created from such materials, from sinners dead in sins and rebels joined to and filled with Satan, a glorious, marvelous, and wonderful Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THREE STEPS TAKEN BY GOD TO PRODUCE THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ephesians speaks of God's eternal purpose, the goal of His eternal purpose, what the church is, and what the original condition and nature of the materials for the church were.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fifth main point is the steps by which God produced the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verses 5 and 6 of chapter two say that even when we were dead in offenses, God made us alive together with Christ, raised us up together with Him, and seated us together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Making Us Alive Together with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because we were dead, God came in to make us alive, to impart life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God imparted Himself in Christ as the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way God made the dead materials alive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ezekiel 37:1-14 contains a picture of this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God's people were likened to dry bones, dead and scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These dry bones signify the materials for the building of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From these dry bones God built up His house, His dwelling place, and He formed an army to fight the battle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Originally these materials were dead and in the grave, but God breathed His breath into them; that is, He imparted His life into them, and the dry bones were made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be made alive is to be regenerated.</S>
