<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. MARRYING THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF EGYPT</H2><P>Solomon married the daughter of the king of Egypt (3:1). In doing this he followed his father in indulging his lust to gain a Gentile wife.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Breaking of the Separation<br>of God's Holy People<br>from the People of Satan's Cosmos</H2><P>This was the breaking of the separation of God's holy people from the people of Satan's cosmos&#151;the evil world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Not Regulated and Restricted<br>by the Law of God</H2><P>In marrying the daughter of the king of Egypt, Solomon was not regulated and restricted by the law of God. In Exodus 34:16, Deuteronomy 7:3, and Joshua 23:12 God charged Israel not to marry the Gentiles, because the Gentiles would cause them to worship idols. But Solomon openly broke this ordinance of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Disobedient to God<br>in Carrying out God's Economy</H2><P>In this matter Solomon was disobedient to God in carrying out God's economy. God's economy included wiping out all the idol-worshipping Gentiles in the land. It was therefore not reasonable for Solomon to marry the daughter of a Gentile king.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. A Sign of Indulgence in the Lust of the Flesh</H2><P>Solomon's marrying an Egyptian was a sign of indulgence in the lust of the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Laying a Foundation for His Future Fall</H2><P>Solomon's marriage to an Egyptian also laid a foundation for his future fall in corruption and ruin.</P>
