   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Believers' Entire Being</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The inward transformation in our nature and essence is the result of the positive organic reaction of the divine life in our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Within us there is the divine life, and with the divine life there is always some positive, organic, and living reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have a living reaction within us because we have the divine life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This reaction of the divine life in our entire being preserves us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must allow the Lord Jesus to occupy our entire being our mind, emotion, and will for our transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>E. The Metabolic Constitution</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>in the Believers' Renewed Being</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every day the Lord is renewing us, and His renewing is a kind of metabolism to supply us with His new element to replace our old element.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This issues in a metabolic constitution in our renewed being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>F. The Expression of the Divine Image's Attributes</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In transformation there is the expression of the divine image's attributes in the believers' renewed being to be the virtues of the believers' new man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is real, living, and present.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has an image and His image has many attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When these attributes are expressed within us, they become our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this to happen, we should not do anything by ourselves or for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, we should let Him do everything with us and for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then He is the divine life within us, moving, living, and working in every part of our being to make our being a renewed being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then all the divine attributes will be expressed through our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Actually His attributes, such as His love, His kindness, His humility, and His gentleness, become our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We then become persons not living by ourselves but by Him as our new element, causing us to become a new man.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>and Consummated Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>in the Believers' New Man</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Transformation results in the manifestation of the processed and consummated Triune God in the believers' new man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through our transformation the Triune God will be expressed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This Triune God is the One who has been processed and consummated, the One who has humanity and who knows what human suffering is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He lives in us, making us just like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, we will fully express Him as the God of love, the God of incarnation, and the God with the elements of humanity and human living.</S>
