<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE ERECTION OF THE TABERNACLE</h1><h1 class="title">(2)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 40</h1><h2 class="head1">THE SEQUENCE<br />IN ERECTING THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>In 40:1-16 we have the commandments of the Lord to Moses concerning the raising up of the tabernacle, and in verses 17 through 33, the actual erection of the tabernacle. Regarding the erection of the tabernacle, we see the following sequence: the raising up of the boards (v. 18); spreading the curtains and the coverings (v. 19); placing the ark of the testimony into the Holy of Holies (vv. 20-21a); putting up the veil to cover the ark of the testimony (v. 21b); placing the table in the Holy Place on the north side, outside the veil, and setting in order upon it the bread before the Lord (vv. 22-23); placing the lampstand in the Holy Place, opposite the table, on the south side, and lighting the lamps before the Lord (vv. 24-25); placing the golden altar in the Holy Place before the veil and burning upon it the incense of fragrant spices (vv. 26-27); putting up the curtain of the door of the tabernacle (v. 28); placing the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle and offering upon it the burnt offering and the meal offering (v. 29); placing the laver between the tabernacle and the altar and putting water there for washing the hands and the feet of the priests (vv. 30-32); raising up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar (v. 33a); and hanging up the curtain of the gate of the court (v. 33b).</p><h2 class="head1">THE CLOUD COVERING THE TENT OF MEETING<br />AND THE GLORY FILLING THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>In 40:34-38 we have a record of the glory of the Lord filling the tabernacle. Verse 34 says, &ldquo;Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.&rdquo; This verse speaks of two aspects; it speaks of something that happened outside the tent of meeting and something that happened inside the tabernacle. The cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory filled the tabernacle. The same structure was both the tent of meeting and the tabernacle. With respect to man, it was the tent of meeting. But with respect to God, it was the tabernacle. We may also say that outwardly it was the tent of meeting and that inwardly it was the tabernacle.</p><p>In the church life today there is a difference between the tent of meeting and the tabernacle. We may have the church life and be in the church life, but we may be on the outside and not on the inside. This means that our church life may be merely the tent of meeting, not the tabernacle.</p><p>If we study the book of Exodus carefully, we shall see that the first mention of the tent of meeting was shortly after the children of Israel practiced idolatry by making a golden calf and worshipping it. Moses moved his tent outside the camp, and then his tent became the tent of meeting.</p><p>In the church life we may simply be gathered around the tent of meeting. We may not be in the tabernacle. In Exodus 40 the tent of meeting was covered by the cloud, but the tabernacle was filled with glory. Those who only gather around the tent of meeting may have the cloud. However, we need to enjoy not only the cloud upon the tent of meeting, but also the glory within the tabernacle.</p><p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I can testify that during the early years I was under the cloud, but today I am inside the tabernacle that is filled with glory. No longer is my enjoyment only that of the cloud, but it is also that of the glory. How about you? Are you enjoying only the cloud upon the tent of meeting, or are you also enjoying the glory within the tabernacle? Certain saints who are very happy and bubbling in the church life may be under the cloud, not in the glory. Such saints need more experience of the church life in order to enter into the tabernacle and see the glory that is inside.</p>
