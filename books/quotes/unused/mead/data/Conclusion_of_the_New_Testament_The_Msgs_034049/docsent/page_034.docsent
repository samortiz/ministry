   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR CHRIST HIS PERSON 24</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall cover more aspects of Christ s person in the fulfillment of the types and figures of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>23.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A Star out of Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Numbers 24:17 says, There shall come a Star out of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Star refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fulfillment of this type of Christ is found in the word of the magi, learned men from the east, recorded in Matthew 2:2: Where is He who is born King of the Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For we saw His star in the east and came to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The magi did not say, We have seen a star, or We have seen the star, but, We have seen His star.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is certainly the fulfillment of Numbers 24:17.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The star spoken of in this verse was shown to these learned men; it did not appear to any of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whereas the Jews had the Scriptures concerning Christ and knew where He would be born Matt 2:4-6 , the magi saw the star of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Jews had the knowledge in letters concerning Christ, but these learned men from the east received a living vision concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually the star led them to the place where Christ was Matt 2:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Christ is the real Sun Mal 4:2 , He does not appear as the Sun during this age of night.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, He shines as a star.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A star shines at night, but it indicates that day is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Christ came the first time, He appeared openly as a star.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when He comes the second time, He will be the morning star Rev 2:28; 22:16 to His overcomers, who watch for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To all others Christ will later appear as the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>24.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The One Hanged on a Tree</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Deuteronomy 21:22 and 23 say, If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: his body shall not remain all night upon the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This word is fulfilled in Galatians 3:13, which reveals that Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by being the One hanged on a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The tree refers to the cross made of wood, a Roman instrument of capital punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Jewish death penalty was by stoning Lev 20:2, 27; 24:23; Deut 13:10; 17:5; 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Crucifixion was a heathen practice Ezra 6:11 adopted by the Romans for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He was hanged on a tree, in fulfillment of Deuteronomy 21:22-23.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>25.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Rock</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have seen that Christ is the rock with the living water, the One smitten by God on the cross so that the Spirit as living water may flow out for us to drink Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we need to see that Christ is the rock in another sense.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Deuteronomy 32:4 speaks of the Rock.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Rock here is the eternal Rock Isa 26:4 , the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This Rock is embodied in Christ as the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As such, Christ is the Rock that begot us Deut 32:18 , that is, the begetting Rock, full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Deuteronomy 32:15; 2 Samuel 22:47; and Psalm 95:1, Christ is the Rock of our salvation, and this Rock is our strength Psa 62:7 and our refuge Psa 94:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Rock is our hiding place, protection, covering, and safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is the Rock Matt 16:18 , the embodiment and expression of the Triune God, on which we rely and on which we stand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the Rock of our salvation, refuge, and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>26.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Good Land</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The good land, the land of Canaan Deut 8:7-10 , is a type of the all-inclusive Christ, the Christ who is all and in all and who is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Passover, the manna, the tabernacle with its furniture, and all the offerings are types depicting various aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only the land of Canaan is a full type, the complete and all-inclusive type, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Old Testament no type other than the good land shows that Christ is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, the good land is the ultimate type of Christ found in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Bible the land is a figure, a symbol, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The land that came out of the death water on the third day Gen 1:9-10, 13 is a type of the resurrected Christ who came out of death on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many different kinds of life, including vegetable, animal, and human life, then came out of the land Gen 1:11-12, 24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This signifies that Christ is the source of all kinds of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everything God prepared for mankind is concentrated in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s intention revealed in the Scriptures is that Christ should be our land.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ as the good land, the land that came out of the death water, the land that was elevated above and surrounded by the death water, is depicted by the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This land is the crucial focus of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For this reason the Lord speaks of the land again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He called out Abraham and told him that He would bring him into a certain land, the land of Canaan Gen 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The center of God s plan, speaking according to type, is the good land with its temple and city.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This portion is the all-inclusive Christ for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Greek word rendered portion in this verse can also be rendered lot, referring to an allotment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When Paul was writing the Epistle to the Colossians, he no doubt had in mind the picture of the allotting of the good land to the children of Israel Josh 14:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Colossians Christ is revealed as our portion, our lot.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Just as the land of Canaan was everything to the children of Israel, so Christ, the reality of the type of the good land, is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The good land provided whatever the children of Israel needed: water, wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive trees, animals, milk, honey, stones, iron, copper.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All these items, most of which are mentioned in Deuteronomy 8:7-10, are types of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In Acts 26:18 Paul refers to the all-inclusive Christ as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As the result of having our eyes opened and of being transferred from the authority of Satan to God, we not only have the forgiveness of sins, but we also receive a divine inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ Col 2:9 who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Holy Spirit, who has been given to the saints, is the foretaste, the seal, the pledge, and the guarantee of this divine inheritance Rom 8:23; Eph 1:13-14 , which we are sharing and enjoying today as a foretaste and will share and enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity 1 Pet 1:4 .</S>
