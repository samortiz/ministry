   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INCREASE OF THE DIVINE SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Your reading of the Bible, your prayer, and your waiting are all the different steps of your making up a kind of leading.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is this not a picture of your past Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For such a long time you built up a lot of leadings, but the genuine leading was mostly ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why many have been seeking after the Lord for years, yet without much growth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The divine sonship within us did not increase much over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, even though we may have been seeking, studying the Bible, praying, waiting on the Lord, yet for so many years we didn t live a life as a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may have lived a life that was much regulated and that was much improved, but it was not so much a life that designated us the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may have had a lot of improvement and a lot of adjustment, yet we didn t have that much growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our divine sonship did not increase much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE LEADING OF THE LORD IN THE FOUR GOSPELS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The four Gospels portray a picture of how the disciples were under the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The leading to the disciples in those days was just the presence, or the stay, of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord s leading to the disciples was His stay, His remaining with them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as He was there, that was the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if you read the Gospels again with this view, you could see that all the disciples including Peter and Mary didn t realize the Lord s genuine leading.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example in John 11, after Lazarus died, Martha and Mary sent the information to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you think that was under the Lord s leading?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That was altogether not needed, so the Lord didn t respond to that call.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead He remained in the place where He was for two more days.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Surely the disciples wondered why the Lord Jesus wouldn t do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps they discussed why the Lord wouldn t go to Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you think their wondering and their discussing was under the Lord s leading?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Surely that was their brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Peter and John and James all had brotherly love, but it seemed that Jesus didn t have brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But then to their great surprise suddenly the Lord said, Let us go into Judea again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Right away their response was that the Jews were seeking to stone Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Again, was their response under the Lord s leading?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By reading John 11 you can find very few of the apostles or the disciples doings that were under the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Mostly whatever they did and whatever they said was far away from the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They all were distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even Martha got distracted by her religious knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus had told her that her brother would rise again, and she responded that she knew he would rise again in the resurrection in the last day vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All these things eventually caused the Lord to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord was there and He was the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His presence, His stay, should have meant everything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They shouldn t say anything; they shouldn t act in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They should just put to death all the practices of their mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This must be our attitude also.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When our lips want to speak, we have to put them to death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever a part of your body wants to do anything, put that to death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you are spontaneously led by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This kind of description gives us a picture of how much we are out of the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even in His presence we may do a lot of things contrary to the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today the Lord is much closer to us than He was to the disciples in the four Gospels before His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time He was only among the disciples and outside of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today He is much closer; He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His abiding in us is the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we are Marthas and Marys and Peters and Johns.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Don t think that you are better than they were.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Of all those disciples, not one was led by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every one of them did something other than the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even when the Lord was going to call Lazarus out of the tomb, Martha indicated that he was stinking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means she had a leading according to the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She knew that four days had passed already.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>She knew too much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a picture of our situation also.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You cannot say that those disciples did not love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Perhaps they loved the Lord more than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They had dropped everything and they were following the Lord every day.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet they were ignoring the Lord all the day.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although the leading was there in His Person, they were ignoring it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They didn t need anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They just needed Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He Himself is all-inclusive.</S>
