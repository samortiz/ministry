   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TELLING OUT GOD S VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are such a race, priesthood, nation, and people so that we may tell out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word rendered tell out also means proclaim abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First we must be born anew and grow in life, and then be built up and serve corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we need to proclaim abroad, to tell out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To serve corporately is to satisfy God by offering up Christ as spiritual sacrifices; to proclaim abroad is to benefit others by showing forth the virtues of the One who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The virtues in verse 9 are excellencies, excellent and glorious virtues 2 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These refer to what God is and has, and the marvelous light of God consummates in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To and by His virtue and glory God has called us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The virtues here are excellent attributes, acts, and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has many virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, He is merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be merciful is a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is also loving.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He even loves sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This love is another of God s virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the excellent divine attributes are the virtues of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to tell out, to proclaim abroad, these excellent virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In his writings Peter emphasizes the matter of virtue more than Paul does.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Peter says in 2 Peter 1:3 that we have been called by the virtue and the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He says not only that we have been called to God s glory and virtue; he says that we have been called by His glory and virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, Peter and the other disciples saw His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At least once, on the mount of transfiguration, they saw the Lord s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Seeing Christ s virtues was a daily occurrence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whatever the Lord did was an excellent act full of virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ s excellencies are great in number.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every day the Lord Jesus manifested His virtues, and Peter saw this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later, Peter wrote that we have been called by the Lord s virtue and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that Peter himself had been attracted by the virtue and glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, he was called to this virtue and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, he is one with the Lord in virtue and in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostles proclaimed the virtues of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They preached them, they taught them, and they announced them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever the apostles preached and taught was a telling out of the virtues they had seen and enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It was a proclaiming abroad of the virtues in which they had participated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is what it means to tell out God s excellencies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today we need to follow the apostles to tell out the excellent virtues of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>CALLED OUT OF DARKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to verse 9, we should proclaim abroad the virtues of the One who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Darkness is the expression and sphere of Satan in death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Light is the expression and sphere of God in life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has called us, delivered us, out of Satan s death-realm of darkness into His life-realm of light Acts 26:18; Col 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE PEOPLE OF GOD OBTAINING MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 10 Peter concludes this section: Who once were not a people, but now are the people of God; who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This word from Hosea 2:23 was quoted by Paul in Romans 9:24-27, referring first to the Gentiles and then to the remnant of Israel, because not all are Israel who are out of Israel Rom 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here Peter, quoting this word, refers to those who received this Epistle, the scattered Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They once were out of Israel, but were not Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, they were not God s people in the New Testament sense.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now, after they were called by God, they became God s people, God s particular possession, as a treasure to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They obtained God s mercy, which they had not obtained before.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I was young, I was bothered by the verses that indicate that the Jewish people were not the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I wondered how it was possible for them, being Jews, not to be God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we read Hosea 2, Romans 9, and this verse from 1 Peter, we may be confused, for the same quotation from Hosea is used to denote the Gentiles and the Jews in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Gentiles were not God s people and they had not obtained His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the same word refers to the Jews in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Romans 9 Paul says that not all are Israel who are of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This refers to Jews who had not believed in the Lord Jesus, to Jews in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But in the sight of God, Israel in the flesh is not the genuine Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only when the Jews believe in the Lord Jesus do they become the real people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before believing in Him, they did not obtain His mercy, but after believing, they have obtained the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now, after much study and digging into the Word, I have seen that the word in Hosea is used in the New Testament to denote both the Gentiles and Israel in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Israel in the flesh actually was not the genuine people of God, the people who had obtained the mercy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But now through believing in the Lord Jesus, they have become the people of God, and they have obtained His mercy.</S>
