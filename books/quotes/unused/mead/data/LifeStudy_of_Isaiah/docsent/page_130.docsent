The Hebrew word translated sorrows in verses 3 and 4 literally means pains, either physical or mental.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Carrying Our Sorrows</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In His vicarious death, Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Surely He has borne our sicknesses,/ And carried our sorrows;/Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken,/Smitten of God and afflicted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But He was pierced because of our transgressions;/He was crushed because of our iniquities;/The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed./We all like sheep have gone astray;/Each of us has turned to his own way,/ And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all/To fall on Him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>4-6 .</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sicknesses and sorrows are mentioned with transgressions and iniquities because our sicknesses and sorrows come from one thing sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we had never sinned, we could never be sick and we would have no sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our transgressions and sins surely need Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since our sicknesses and sorrows come from sin, they also need Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Isaiah 53 we are told clearly that Christ bore our sicknesses and carried our sorrows in His vicarious death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, when we are sick, it is proper for us to pray, "Lord, because in Your death for me You bore my sicknesses, I do have the ground to ask You to take my sickness away."</S>
