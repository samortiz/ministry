   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY LED BY THE SPIRIT BY ENJOYING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIS ALL-INCLUSIVE INDWELLING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we consider once more Romans 8:14 which reads: For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have come to a point which we can never avoid.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we would know the leading of the Spirit, we must get through the point which we are going to cover in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may consider the point of this message as something quite common or quite ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But actually it is not that common.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You might consider it so common because our understanding of the leading of the Spirit has not been adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The problem is this: most Christians through the centuries have considered that God s leading is just God s action, God s activity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because you are a child of God, you like to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You don t like to do anything by your own way; you like to follow His way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So you pray, asking God the Father to give you a leading that you may follow.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of prayer indicates that you consider the leading of the Lord is His action, His activity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Romans 8:14 says that the leading is to be led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you read such a word you must be alert, and you must pay your full attention to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It doesn t say that we need the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is something different.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To have the leading of the Spirit is one thing; to be led by the Spirit is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes Christians say that they have a leading from the Lord, but eventually they discover that they went the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They prayed, they touched their inner feeling, they looked at their outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It seems they were fully confirmed that a certain thing was fully from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But eventually they went the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is because our realization of the matter of the leading of the Spirit has not been so accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were taught in the wrong way, so our realization has not been adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By our natural birth we have a tendency to receive this kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some have been taught to seek the leading of God according to three things: the inner feeling, the Word of God, and the outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If these three things line up, that indicates the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians have heard this kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is easy to understand, and we all have the inclination toward this kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have the tendency to receive this kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A LEADING BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But I am going to fellowship with you concerning one point which is contrary to your natural tendency.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The leading in Romans 8:14 is not a leading of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, it is a leading by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A leading of the Lord is one thing, and a leading by the Lord is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we had our Life-study of Genesis, I stressed strongly that from the first time Abraham was called out, the Lord didn t give him any leading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord only told him that he had to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord didn t tell him how he should go on.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words the Lord didn t give him any road maps.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Abraham s leading was the Lord Himself, a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This Person was with him all the time doing the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Abraham was led by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Abraham didn t receive a leading of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>ANOTHER PERSON LIVING WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to understand clearly the matter of being led by the Spirit, we have to realize it is absolutely a fact that we Christians who have believed in the Lord Jesus and have been really regenerated do have another Person living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may think you know this already.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But to know this is one thing, and to realize daily, hourly, and even momentarily that you have another One living within you is another thing.</S>
