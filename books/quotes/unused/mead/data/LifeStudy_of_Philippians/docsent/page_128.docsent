   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SALVATION FROM MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The salvation in 2:12 is not salvation from the condemnation of God or from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, salvation here refers to the salvation we experience day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In particular, it is salvation from murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 14 Paul says, Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need an instant salvation to deliver us from our murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have pointed out that the sisters have a particular problem with murmurings, and the brothers, with reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Usually the wives are given to murmuring, and the husbands, to reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we all are troubled by murmurings or reasonings, we need the kind of salvation that can rescue us, not only from God s condemnation and from the lake of fire, but also from our murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that we need a subjective, moment-by-moment salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have seen that, as our pattern, Christ emptied Himself and humbled Himself and also was exalted and glorified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sisters, do you think that while you are murmuring, God will come in to exalt you?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brothers, do you believe that while you are reasoning, God will come in to glorify you?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Surely God will not exalt us or glorify us when we are murmuring or reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Oh, we need salvation from murmurings and reasonings!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both murmurings and reasonings are signs of rebellion and disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 12 Paul says that the Philippians have always obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We also need to obey to obey Christ as our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the One who became our pattern, the Lord Jesus did not murmur or reason.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, He emptied Himself and humbled Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we must obey this pattern, realizing that Christ does not murmur or reason, but empties Himself and humbles Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the brothers are tempted to reason, they need to remember the pattern of the self-emptying and self-humbling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brothers should then obey this pattern without reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This obedience is the working out of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever we obey Christ as our pattern, we automatically work out our salvation from our murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christians often ask others if they have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I was asked this question as a young man, I answered strongly that I had been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if I were asked this question today, I would reply, What do you mean by saved ?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you mean saved from God s judgment and from the lake of fire, I most assuredly have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if you mean saved from reasonings, I would have to admit that I have been saved in part, but not yet in full.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Years ago, I used to wonder why Paul included verse 14 in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seemed to me that what Paul had written was so high that there was no need for this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After saying that Christ was exalted and given a name above every name, that every tongue would confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, and that we must work out our own salvation according to God s operating within us, Paul suddenly tells us to do all things without murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It seemed to me that murmurings and reasonings were too insignificant to be mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, after more experience I learned that we definitely need to be saved in a practical way from reasonings and murmurings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church life and in our married life there is a lot of murmuring and reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sisters may behave properly, but within they may murmur against the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What sister can say that she has never murmured about anything in the church life?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the sisters do not complain outwardly, they certainly murmur inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the brothers hear of the sisters murmuring, they may react by reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because we have murmurings and reasonings, we need the practical salvation revealed in Philippians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The salvation here is not the salvation we have received once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the contrary, it is the salvation which we need to work out in order to be rescued daily from our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have pointed out that this salvation is Christ as our pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the pattern and the salvation are one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The pattern is the salvation, and the salvation is the pattern worked out in us.</S>
