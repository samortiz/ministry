   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN THE RICH WORD, THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND UNCEASING PRAYER FOR LIVING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 3:16-17; Eph 5:18-20; 1 Thes 5:17-19; Phil 1:19-21a GOD S ECONOMY VERSUS THE NATURAL CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a great difference between God s economy and the natural human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our concept is that after we are saved we should make up our minds to improve our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Probably every genuine Christian has made such a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to our concept, we need to improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Conscious of our weakness, we beg God to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, God does not answer this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more we pray that He will help us to improve, the less He will do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, our behavior may even worsen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reason for this is that the concept of receiving help from God to improve our behavior is contrary to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s economy is to dispense Himself into us and to work Himself into us that we may take Him as our life and life supply in order to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not to have an improved human character; it is to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to His economy, God s intention is to impart His element, His substance, and the ingredients of His nature into our being that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christians have fallen into the trap of trying to improve their character.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We thank the Lord that in His recovery we are being rescued from this trap.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many years ago it was my habit to pray that the Lord would help me to improve my behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I wanted to be a very refined human being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Especially, I wanted to have more love for my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Realizing my inability, I asked the Lord to help me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now instead of praying in this way, I enjoy God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I see that His intention is to dispense, or transfuse, Himself into me that I may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>NOT OUTWARD CORRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BUT INWARD TRANSFUSION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may use other terms to describe God s desire to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wants to water us, feed us, refresh us, and nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These terms indicate that God wants to be our life, life supply, food, drink, and air.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is our food to nourish us; our drink to quench our thirst; our air to refresh us; and our life supply to enrich us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the divine Being, He infuses us with His elements, causing us to be the same as He in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His economy God does not improve us outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, He transmits all that He is into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The difference between outward correction and inward transfusion can be illustrated by the difference between applying makeup and having a healthy complexion because of eating properly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man s way is to apply makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s way is to transform us metabolically; it is to nourish, refresh, water, enrich, and strengthen us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is rich in His nourishing, watering, feeding, refreshing, and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Oh, His shining brings in His riches!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The air, water, and food also supply His riches to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Bible God likens Himself to food, water, air, and sunshine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Psalm 84:11 says that the Lord is our sun.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God does not merely teach us; He nourishes us, waters us, and infuses all His riches into our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>CONSTITUTED OF WHAT WE EAT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s purpose in transmitting His riches into us is that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Dietitians tell us that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we eat a great deal of a certain kind of food, we shall be constituted of that food.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I was young, I noticed that everyone who lived in the home of my grandparents smelled like fish.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>My mother explained to me that the people in that area eat fish three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because they ate so much fish, they became constituted of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This illustrates the fact that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we eat Christ, we shall be constituted of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God s economy is that we eat Christ and become constituted of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In John 6 the Lord Jesus says that He is the bread of life, the bread which came down from heaven, and that those who eat Him will live because of Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>35, 41, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then in John 7 He sounds the call: If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink v. 37 . This the Lord Jesus said concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Revelation 22:17 the call is sounded once again to come and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord calls us to drink of the Spirit, of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Having passed through the steps of a divine process, the Triune God is now a universal, all-inclusive drink, prepared and available.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every meeting of the church should be a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord calls us to partake of Him as our food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whether or not a particular meeting is of the Lord can be determined by whether or not there is a dining table in that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you go to a Catholic cathedral, you will find superstition instead of feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The church meetings, by contrast, are a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In every meeting there is a dining table set for us, and we have the opportunity to eat and drink of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By now it should be clear that what we need is not outward improvement or correction.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our need is to take in the Triune God by eating and drinking of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to God s ordination, the way to partake of Him is to eat Him and drink Him.</S>
