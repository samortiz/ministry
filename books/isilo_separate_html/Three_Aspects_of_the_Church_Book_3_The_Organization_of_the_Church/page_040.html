<h1 class="title">KNOWING THE SPIRITUAL ASPECT<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING HEAVENLY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being Heavenly<br />
according to Its Nature</h2>
<p>The church is in resurrection, and it is spiritual and heavenly. Ephesians 1 and 2 clearly show that the church is seated together with Christ in the heavenlies (2:6) and that all the blessings that God has bestowed upon the church are spiritual blessings in the heavenlies (1:3). According to the position of the church and the blessings that the church has received, the church is truly in a heavenly realm. The heavenly nature of the church is one of the crucial blessings that the church has received. The nature of the church is heavenly.</p>
<p>If we carefully analyze Ephesians 1 and 2, we will see that these chapters speak of the position, nature, function, and sphere of the church. According to these two chapters, the church&rsquo;s position, nature, function, and sphere should be heavenly. <em>Sphere</em> refers to the church&rsquo;s expression, the condition that the church manifests. Every aspect of the church should be spiritual and heavenly, because the church is in resurrection.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 1 and 2 <em>heavenlies</em> indicates not only the heavenly place but also the heavenly nature of the church. The Greek word for <em>heavenlies</em> has various connotations. In English we can differentiate its meaning by also translating it as &ldquo;in heaven&rdquo; or &ldquo;heavenly.&rdquo; Hence, <em>heavenlies</em> in Ephesians 2 includes place, yet its emphasis is on the heavenly nature, not the heavenly place. According to place, the church is still on earth and not in heaven, but according to its nature, the church has been brought into the heavenly realm through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Thus, the emphasis of <em>heavenlies</em> is on nature.</p>
<p>In the Bible resurrection is never separated from ascension. Resurrection and ascension are always related to one another. Especially in Acts, resurrection is altogether related to ascension. This can be compared to the palm and the back of the hand. They are always related and cannot be separated. A hand cannot have only a backside without a palm or a palm without a backside. Likewise, resurrection and ascension cannot be separated; they are joined to one another. The resurrection of the Lord Jesus brings man into God, that is, into the heavenly nature. In other words, the Lord Jesus&rsquo; resurrection brought humanity, which He put on and was joined to, into the heavenly nature. Some have proposed that in Ephesians 2 the word <em>heavenlies</em> should be translated as &ldquo;heavenly realm.&rdquo; It is somewhat misleading to use the word <em>realm,</em> because realm is a matter of sphere. The Lord brings us into the heavenly realm, which is not only a matter of sphere but also a matter of nature.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:47 says, &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven.&rdquo; The first man is earthy, and the second man is heavenly. The first man is Adam, who was made from the dust of the earth. The second man is Christ. The second man spoken of in this verse is not the Christ in incarnation but the Christ who has passed through crucifixion and resurrection. Adam and his descendants are earthy, but Christ and the people whom He gained in resurrection are heavenly. Thus, according to 1 Corinthians 15, the natural man is earthy, but the regenerated man of the new creation in Christ is heavenly. How can we who were originally earthy become heavenly? The explanation lies in Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, death, and resurrection. Through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, death, and resurrection, our earthy nature has been transformed and brought into the heavenly nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Heaven Being Related to the Authority of God</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit is resurrection, and God is resurrection. Resurrection is God Himself, and God is the Holy Spirit; therefore, the Holy Spirit is resurrection. In the Bible heaven refers not only to a place but, even more, to something mysterious. If we read the Bible carefully, we will see that God and heaven cannot be separated. God and heaven are joined together.</p>
<p>Luke 15:18 says, &ldquo;I have sinned against heaven and before you.&rdquo; This utterance is very particular. It shows that God and heaven are connected. We cannot say that God is heaven, but we can say that heaven is joined to God. God&rsquo;s nature is spiritual and heavenly. The Bible says explicitly that God is Spirit (John 4:24), but it does not say that God is heaven. In the light of the Bible, however, we can see that God&rsquo;s nature is not only spiritual but also heavenly.</p>
<p>What does <em>heavenly</em> mean? This is a very difficult question to answer. God is Spirit; hence, His nature is spiritual. The Bible also shows that anything that is of God is heavenly. In 1 Corinthians 15 the second man, Christ, is out of heaven (v. 47). The New Testament frequently mentions the heavens, and the Gospel of Matthew repeatedly makes mention of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, Daniel 4:25-26 speaks of the heavens&rsquo; ruling. It seems that Daniel considers the heavens as something living. When he says that the heavens do rule, he means that God rules over men. However, verse 26 does not say that God rules but that the heavens rule. Thus, heaven has a very particular significance in the Bible. In the New Testament, Hebrews places great emphasis on heaven and the heavenly nature. It refers to our calling as &ldquo;a heavenly calling&rdquo; (3:1). Moreover, it also says that today Christ is &ldquo;a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens&rdquo; (4:14) and that the holy place into which He entered is in heaven itself (8:1-2; 9:24).</p>
<p>The Lord prayed in Matthew 6:10, &ldquo;Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth.&rdquo; This kingdom is the kingdom, or ruling, of the heavens. Therefore, in this verse the emphasis of <em>heaven</em> is God&rsquo;s authority. Every heavenly matter is full of God&rsquo;s authority, God&rsquo;s lordship, and God&rsquo;s position. In contrast, whenever we speak of something spiritual, we emphasize God&rsquo;s nature and life more than His authority. The fact that a person is spiritual means that he is full of God&rsquo;s life inwardly. Although God&rsquo;s authority is realized through the Holy Spirit, the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2) and the Spirit of power (Luke 24:49). Moreover, it never uses the term <em>the Spirit of authority</em>. In the Bible the Holy Spirit is chiefly spoken of in regard to God&rsquo;s life, and in Romans 8:2 He is even called the Spirit of life. In contrast, in the Bible the term <em>heaven</em> is directly associated with the authority of God. Whenever heaven is spoken of in the Bible, the emphasis is God&rsquo;s authority. The most obvious examples are &ldquo;the heavens do rule&rdquo; in Daniel 4:26 and &ldquo;the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; in Matthew (5:3, 10, 19-20).</p>
<p>The opposite of being heavenly is to be earthy. To be earthy means to be earthly and worldly. What does it mean to be worldly? To be worldly means to reject God&rsquo;s authority and ruling. To be heavenly means to submit to God&rsquo;s authority. Of course, to be heavenly also has many other connotations, but according to the Bible, to be heavenly primarily denotes being under God&rsquo;s authority. Every matter that is earthly is not in submission to God&rsquo;s authority, but every heavenly matter is in submission to God&rsquo;s authority. Hence, there is a big difference between being heavenly and being earthly. The difference lies in whether or not there is submission to God&rsquo;s authority. Earthly matters are not in submission to God&rsquo;s authority but heavenly matters are.</p>
<p>The garments that the children of Israel wore had fringes on their borders, and on each fringe was a cord of blue (Num. 15:38-40). This signifies that their conduct and behavior were restricted by heaven. To be restricted is a matter of authority. The cord of blue on the fringes of the borders of their garments restricted their steps. This signifies that their conduct and behavior before God were under the restriction of heaven. Garments signify man&rsquo;s conduct, and the blue cord on the fringe of the border of the garment signifies that a man&rsquo;s conduct is not only heavenly but also under the rule of heaven. If the blue cord signified merely being heavenly, it could have been placed on another part of the garment. There would have been no need to place it on the border of the garment. By being placed on the border of the garment, it encircled their footsteps. The encircling of the footsteps indicates authority, because encircling is a restriction. To be restricted is to be under authority.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
