   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE THIRTY THE GROWTH AND MULTIPLICATION OF THE GROUP MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Heb 10:24-25; 2 Tim 2:2; Eph 4:11-12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will continue to fellowship concerning the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all must see that the group meeting is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is more than eighty percent of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a church does not have strong group meetings, it could never be that strong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A church's condition is closely related to the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Without the group meetings, a church will stagnate and become stale.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To give messages to a big congregation may help the saints somewhat, but for the church to be living, fresh, high, and rich, we must have group meetings according to the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>BEING FLEXIBLE IN PRACTICING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the full-time training, I have given you many practical points concerning the first three steps of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These points are the result of much experimenting in our full-time trainings and have also been confirmed by the experiences of some of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, you should not take these points in a legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You must be very flexible in your practice of these steps.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our being flexible gives the Lord a way to reach all His seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Recently I heard a number of testimonies from new ones who had been contacted by saints practicing the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At least two were contacted through the telephone by saints who simply began to call numbers in the phone book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Another two had been hoping that some Christians would contact them to bring them to a church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While they were considering in this way, some saints knocked on their door.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are a number of cases like this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By all these testimonies you can see how the Holy Spirit is working today in so many wandering people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the United States today, there are many wandering people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though they may be settled outwardly, they do not have a goal, a destination, for their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These people are always longing for a friend that can help them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can help them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They do not have a destination, but we do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They do not have a goal in their lives, but we can give them a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not go out, how can we find these people?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mankind has become a pack of wolves; yet today, at the end of the age, there are many sons of peace among these wolves Luke 10:3, 6 , waiting for us to contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not go to contact them, how can we find them?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord visited Zaccheus, He said that "the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" Luke 19:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord went out with a purpose to find His lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we intend to find the Lord's sheep, we also must go out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, when we go out to visit people, we should not be too legal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not say, "Brother Lee told us that we must first visit our close relatives, then our neighbors, then our classmates, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we should not contact this person because he is not a relative or a neighbor."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is too legal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit is like the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not know which way the wind will blow, but when He blows, we must be flexible to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as we keep the principle that we who love the Lord should go out to visit people to bring them the gospel, we can be flexible in every way.</S>
