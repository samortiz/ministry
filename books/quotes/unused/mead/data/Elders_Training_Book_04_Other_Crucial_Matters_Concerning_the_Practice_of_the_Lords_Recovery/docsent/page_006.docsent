   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF PROPER DISCERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To read others' old books needs quite an amount of proper discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since I came to the United States, in my speaking I have rarely referred you to some other writings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I did this purposely.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Books such as Andrew Murray's The Spirit of Christ, however, I did have and still have the peace to refer you to.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I was writing the notes for the book of Luke, I asked my helpers to turn to Dean Alford for a certain point.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I used Dean Alford very much, but his interpretation of this certain point was absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows that we must have the proper discernment in reading the others' theological writings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first year of my study of the Bible and of the so-called theological matters was in the year 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The books I first received were mainly from reformed theology.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was very much interested and burdened to know the seven parables in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I collected the books which the reformed theologians had translated into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their theological teaching told me that the leaven referred to in Matthew 13:33 was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They say it is the influence of Christianity, the influence of the biblical truth, or the entrance of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually this gospel will influence the entire world and the world will become a utopia.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They also say that the big tree in Matthew 13:31-32 was something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was wondering about their teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A year later, I began to contact the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They taught me exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the beginning I was wondering who was right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The books I had read by the reformed theologians were translated by the missionaries in China and were published by the top Christian publication firm in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The local Brethren Assembly I was attending, however, was small.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An old British brother taught there all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I had to consider and weigh which teachings to take.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TAKING CARE OF THE YOUNG ONES</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I passed through this stage of picking up wrong interpretations and concepts of the Scriptures, so I learned something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not like to see that the Lord's recovery is being brought backward to the old writings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I also do not like to see that the young generation would be brought back to the old things to occupy them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must realize that we only have one life to live.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even with two or three lives, you cannot exhaust the reading of the Christian books.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not like to see people misdirected in reading things that will waste their time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the Lord's mercy, there has been a kind of laboratory work done through Brother Nee and us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have picked up the necessary, basic items of the divine, spiritual, and heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have put all these things, not in a scholarly form, but in a "layman's form" which is John's form in the book of John.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>My burden is that we must take good care of the young ones among us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not bring them into peril so that they would be occupied with the wrong things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have a pure system of publications which comprise all the main things of the divine, spiritual, and heavenly things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These publications are very adequate for all the young saints among us to have a good foundation laid and a strong standing established.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then they could go on, not to learn more things from the old books, but to check the old books and to get themselves confirmed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For us to bring the young ones into the old books without consideration is a peril and a risk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not safe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What you young ones can use as reference books, however, are the dictionaries, lexicons, and concordances.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nearly all the dictionaries have some good points.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No dictionary, however, is complete and all differ from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Never be satisfied with one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must use more than one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When you investigate a word, do not be satisfied with one dictionary's definition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You must look into others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are the only things which I would recommend for you young ones to use the lexicons, the dictionaries of languages, and the concordances of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You should use these references in the way of comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This will help you.</S>
