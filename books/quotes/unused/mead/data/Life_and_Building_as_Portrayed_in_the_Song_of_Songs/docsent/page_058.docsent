   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOING OUT OF THE WORLD WITH JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this point, someone asks again about the seeking one coming up from the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>8:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By this, we see that there are two wildernesses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen, in chapter three, the wilderness of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here in chapter eight, we have the physical wilderness of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the seeking Christians are going out of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not believe that anyone who is really seeking the Lord senses that he is a settler on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not settlers in this world; we are pilgrims passing through.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter how long we live in Los Angeles, we are passing through Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This earth to us is just a wilderness, and we are passing through.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the seeking one is going out of the wilderness leaning upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter three she was going out of that psychological wilderness as a pillar by herself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But now she is going out of the physical wilderness leaning upon the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This poetry depicts that as she is going out, she is one with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We know that while we are waiting for the rapture, we are waiting for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this verse shows us that the Lord is not coming, but going out with her.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While she is going out of the world, she is leaning upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This clearly means that the Lord is going out of this world with her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can well ask, "Is the Lord coming or going?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is really difficult for our minds to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are waiting for His coming, yet He is going out with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I can tell you that if He is not going out with us, we can never be waiting properly for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would be one who is sincerely waiting for His coming, surely we need Him to go with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He goes with us to meet Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He goes with us for His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need not ask how this will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We know by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While we are waiting for His coming, we are not going out of this world by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are, we will never go out!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If, on the other hand, we are those who are really waiting for His coming, we will deeply sense that we are going out of this world leaning upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"O Lord Jesus, day by day I am going out with You, and You are going out with me for Your coming back."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It may not appeal logically to our mind, but it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus is a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is going out with us, yet He is also coming.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He told Nicodemus that while He was on the earth, He was still in heaven John 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He came from heaven, and then He was on the earth; yet, while He was on earth, He was still in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All those who are really waiting for His coming are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, they are going out of this world, not by themselves, but by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we are going with Him, we realize that the "going-out" strength is not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not have the strength to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The going-out strength is simply Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We lean upon Him, and in a sense He bears us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A SINNER SAVED BY GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the question is asked concerning the one going out of the wilderness, the Lord Jesus answers: "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth; there she brought thee forth that bare thee" 8:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord answers that she is the one He raised under the apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We know from chapter two that the apple tree is the lovely and nourishing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was there that He regenerated her.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Who is this one?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This one is simply a sinner, regenerated by God's grace in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should never consider that we are so high or wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must always realize that regardless of how mature we are, we are simply saved sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are just under the lovely and nourishing Christ, regenerated by the grace and life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should never forget what we were in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before regeneration we were a fallen, corrupted, and deadened sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But one day God put us under the apple tree; He put us under the nourishing Christ and regenerated us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No matter what position we may have in the church or how mature we are, we should never boast of it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, we should always remember what we were.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our estate is still just a sinner saved by grace; this is all we are.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For such an impression to be given in chapter eight is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If it had been given in chapter one, it would not have been so significant.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But here at the very consummation of her Christian life, the Lord reminds her that even now she is nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She is just a sinner saved by the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the answer the Lord gives concerning the seeking one.</S>
