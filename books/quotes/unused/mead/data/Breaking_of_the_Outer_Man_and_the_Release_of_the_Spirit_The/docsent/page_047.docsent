   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE PLIABLENESS AFTER THE BREAKING PLIABLENESS AND THE BREAKING OF THE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God uses many ways to break our outer man, and these ways vary from person to person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the reason the Holy Spirit directs different kinds of disciplining works to different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With some people, God deals specifically with their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Again and again God orders environments that deal with their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With other people, God deals with their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Again and again God orders environments that break their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With still others, God deals with their wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He tears down their trust in their kind of walk which has its source in their own wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He allows them to blunder and fail in everything they lay hold of around them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God allows them to fail again and again in order that they learn not to trust in their own wisdom, until they say, "I live not by man's wisdom but by the mercy of God."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With some people, the Holy Spirit may order yet another kind of discipline; He may use the environment to shatter their subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people are very opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are full of ideas and methods.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible says, "I am Jehovah...is there anything too hard for me?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jer 32:27, Darby .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With some brothers, it seems that there is nothing too hard for them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They never find one thing which prompts them to bow down and confess their ignorance and inability.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord's Spirit has to deal with them through all kinds of environments; He has to strike again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These ones will find that in spite of their boasting about everything, they cannot accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Things they consider to be easy turn out to be the causes of failure and embarrassment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Holy Spirit chooses to humble them through this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Simply put, the Spirit strikes different men at different points.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit also deals with everyone at different speeds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With some, the Lord's rod visits them in a relentless, rapid sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With others, the Lord deals with them for a while and then gives them a period of respite.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But one thing is unchanging: He always scourges those whom He loves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should find many bruised spots among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are the result of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When chastisement comes, it may hit different spots, but the goal is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever outward form the chastisement takes, inwardly these chastisements always wound the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God may choose to deal with our self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He may choose to deal with our pride, our wisdom, or our subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever point He touches, the result of every dealing is to make us weaker than before.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He deals with us repeatedly until our self is wounded and we are weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some are touched in a particular way in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others are touched in a particular way in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever area a man is touched in, the end result is the breaking of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He may be hit in one area, but the breaking is always applied to the self and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are all stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our will is stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our stubborn will is boosted by our mind, our proposals, our self-love, our emotion, and our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The things that sustain our stubborn will may be different, but in every case there is a hardness of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The smiting, dealing, and breaking work of the Holy Spirit may be different, but the final and intrinsic cutting work is the same it deals with the self and strikes at the will.</S>
