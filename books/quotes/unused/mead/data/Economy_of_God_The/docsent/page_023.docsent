   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE DIGGING OF OUR INWARD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HIDDEN PARTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will learn how to have the flow of the Spirit in our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Numbers 20 the smitten rock, which typifies Christ as the One who was smitten and riven on the cross, flowed with living water Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in Numbers 21 the well dug by the people of God sprang up with water vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, in these two chapters of the same book there is first a rock that had to be smitten for the living water to flow out, and then a well that had to be dug for the water to spring up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we read the Scriptures carefully, we will realize that both the rock and the well are types of Christ, revealing Him in two different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The rock typifies Christ crucified on the cross, smitten by God so that the living water, which is the Spirit of life, may flow out into us John 19:34; 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The well shows a different aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whereas the rock is Christ crucified on the cross, the well is Christ within us 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For believers it is not a matter of the rock but of the well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ as the rock has already accomplished His work on the cross, which issued in the water of life flowing into us; but today Christ as the well of living water springing up continuously within us is a different aspect of Christ and has much to do with the present process of digging.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The purpose of this chapter is not to give further teaching but to encourage us to go to the Lord to be dug.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must not talk too much about doctrines, about circumstances, about future steps, nor about guidance concerning the Lord s will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We ourselves must be dug, because I believe that even up to the present moment most of us do not have the free flow of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our prayers are not so free.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our testimonies are not so strong, and in many ways we have been defeated and are not so victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is due to one thing: the flow of the spiritual life, or the spring of the living water, is not free within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is much dirt within us that must be dug out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may ask, What is this dirt?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the dirt in our conscience, our emotion, our will, and our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our heart has much dirt that needs to be dug out, and even in our spirit there is some dirt that must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>DIGGING THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By using the word dirt, I mean that our conscience is not purified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps at this very moment some accusations that we have not confessed to the Lord are still on our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These accusations are the dirt that needs to be dug away.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The reason we do not sense much liberty within is that there are accusations in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What are the accusations in your conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must ask yourself this question; only you know.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You know what is within you that is wrong with others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you are not right with others, the accusations persist.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you refuse to do what the Lord demands, this becomes an accusation in your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then you wonder why you are bound and without freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is simply because there is a demand of the Lord that you will not answer, and it has become an immediate accusation in your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Your conscience is not free from accusation and without offense.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we would experience a free, inward flow of the Spirit, our conscience must first be dealt with and purified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can dig the dirt away only by going to the Lord several times each day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I would suggest that during this week we go to the Lord again and again, even while we are walking along the street.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to go to the Lord in our spirit and be dug in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By the help of the Holy Spirit we must dig away all the dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>DIGGING THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After dealing with the accusations in our conscience, we must also dig away the many things condemned by the Lord in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not many brothers and sisters have a pure heart in seeking only the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On one hand, many are seeking the Lord and His way, but on the other hand, they are still seeking many things other than the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their heart then becomes complicated and is not free and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must go to the Lord once again to dig away all the things other than Christ in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may ask, What things need to be dug away?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps one of the first things is our concern about the future and the leading of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not be bothered by this; the future is not in our hands but in the Lord s. In fact, we should not have any future the Lord Himself is our only future.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not know how sticky our heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many years ago fly paper was used to catch flies, and it was very sticky.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whatever touched it stuck to it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our heart is just like fly paper; it is very sticky.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whatever touches our heart sticks to it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These things must all be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It seems that we are all seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many of us are living only for the Lord and have given up our homes and our jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Day by day we are seeking the Lord s leading, but we do not know how many things complicate our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to forget these things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To dig away the dirt from our conscience is easy, but to dig away the dirt from our heart is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In many things we are kind to ourselves; we do not like to dig our heart severely.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is easy to dig away the accusations from our conscience, but it is not easy to dig away the things that we love from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are stuck to the things that we hold dearly.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because of this, the Scriptures tell us that we need a good conscience and a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no doubt that we love the Lord and are seeking Him, but our loving and seeking the Lord are with a complicated heart.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The aim and the goal of our heart are not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We do not know how many goals are within our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What about our family?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our job?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our degree?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What about this year, and next year?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are many things still in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All this dirt is frustrating the flow of living water within us and must be dug away.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Since the day we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, He has come into us as the springing well of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But the problem today is that there is too much dirt in our conscience and in our heart.</S>
