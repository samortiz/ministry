   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He Is the Firstborn of All Creation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is all-inclusive; He includes both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since He includes God, in the Divine Trinity He is not only the Son, but He is also called the Father, and He is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since He includes man, He became flesh as a man, taking the form of a slave, having the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, He includes all creation and is the Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, the inclusiveness of Christ is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Angels are part of the creation; hence, the Lord Jesus also includes the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is the Angel of Jehovah Exo 3:2-15; 14:19; 23:20-21; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>13:15-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Revelation, He is the "another Angel" who takes care of God's people on earth 7:2-3 , adds His fragrance to the prayers of the saints and offers them before God 8:3 , treads on the sea and on the land to take possession of the whole earth 10:1-2 , and destroys Babylon the Great 18:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus even includes fallen men because He Himself became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans and Galatians reveal clearly that the flesh denotes fallen man Rom 3:20; Gal 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, He is all-inclusive; He is not only the Creator but also a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ includes man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, He became a man with flesh, having human blood, flesh, and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At His crucifixion, not one of His bones was broken John 19:33-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Blood, flesh, and bones evidently belong to a created being; therefore, it is illogical to say that the Lord Jesus is not a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since Christ partook of blood and flesh Heb 2:14 , having a body with human blood, flesh, and bones, how could He not be a created One?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As God, Christ is the Creator; as a man, Christ is a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His divinity, He is the Creator; in His humanity, since He became flesh, His flesh was something created.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we must confess that He is the Creator and also a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To say that the Lord Jesus is not a creature is equivalent to denying that He has come in the flesh; such denial was a heresy strongly condemned by the apostle John 1 John 4:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since Christ is a creature in His humanity, when was He created?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Arius asserted that since Christ is a creature, He is not the eternal God, but He was created by God at a certain period in eternity as the first created One.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, in this thought, there was a time when Christ did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a great heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Colossians 1:15b says that Christ is "the Firstborn of all creation."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that, in God's eternal plan, in God's eternal economy, the Triune God agreed that the Son would become a man, would become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From that time on, in the eyes of God, the Son has been a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then, in time, He actually came to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some may ask, "It was two thousand years ago when the Lord Jesus became a man in time, and before that time there were already millions and millions of people; how can we say that He is the Firstborn of all creation?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have already said that God's calculation is different from man's calculation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, Adam is the first man created by God, so the second man should be Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet the Bible says that the second man is Christ 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, since the first Adam is the beginning of mankind, all human beings are descendants of Adam and all of them are "Adams."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, there are Adams being born every day; so the last Adam should have not come yet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, the Bible says that Christ is not only the second man but also the last Adam v. 45 . This is God's calculation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, according to history the Lord Jesus was crucified two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Scripture, however, He is the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world Rev 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Long before Christ was born, He was slain from the foundation of the world; this is God's estimation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, we cannot consider the all-inclusiveness of Christ according to our view.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Genesis 18, as early as the time of Abraham, Christ appeared to Abraham in the form of a man with a real body, and His feet were washed and He ate the meal that Abraham prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to man's view, how could Christ appear as a man before His incarnation?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Judges 13, as the Angel of Jehovah, Christ appeared as a man to Manoah and his wife vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Manoah asked the Angel of Jehovah for His name, and He said, "Why do you ask about My name, since it is wonderful?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His name is wonderful because He is the Angel of Jehovah and He is also Jehovah, yet He appeared as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is truly beyond human understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, instead of trying to comprehend these truths with our minds, we should simply receive them by faith according to God's revelation.</S>
