PHARAOH AND HIS ARMY<br />PURSUING THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL<br />TO THE MIDST OF THE RED SEA</h2><p>When Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, the waters were divided (14:21). Then &ldquo;the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left&rdquo; (v. 22). Instead of a dead end, there was now a way through the sea. Therefore, with the Angel behind them, the children of Israel crossed over the sea on dry ground. Then, because they had been hardened by God to pursue His people, &ldquo;the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh&rsquo;s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen&rdquo; (v. 23). Pharaoh and his army pursued the children of Israel to the midst of the Red Sea because the Lord had hardened the hearts of the Egyptians. God did this for the purpose of glorifying Himself through Pharaoh and through his army, his chariots, and his horsemen (vv. 17-18, Heb.).</p><h2 class="head1">VII. JEHOVAH DEFEATING PHARAOH AND HIS ARMY</h2><p>Verse 24 says that the Lord looked to the camp of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and &ldquo;confused the army of the Egyptians&rdquo; (Heb.). According to verse 25, the Lord &ldquo;took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily.&rdquo; Some versions say that the Lord bound the wheels so that they could not move. Confused and unable to move their chariots, the Egyptians said, &ldquo;Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Jehovah fighteth for them against the Egyptians&rdquo; (v. 25, Heb.). However, it was too late to flee. At the word of the Lord, Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and &ldquo;the sea returned to his strength&rdquo; (v. 27). The water returned to its usual current, and the Egyptians perished.</p><h2 class="head1">VIII. PHARAOH AND HIS ARMY<br />DROWNED AND BURIED IN THE SEA</h2><p>Although the Egyptians tried to flee, the Lord shook them off in the midst of the sea (v. 27, Heb.). Verse 28 goes on to say, &ldquo;And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them&rdquo; (Heb.). Pharaoh and his army were drowned and buried in the sea. This signifies that Satan and the world have been buried in baptism (vv. 26-28; 15:4-5, 10, 19).</p><p>After he was buried in the sea, Pharaoh was terminated. Never would he struggle again, for his usefulness in the hand of God was finished. Having been released from the usurping hand of Pharaoh by crossing the Red Sea, the children of Israel entered into another realm. But Pharaoh, because he was no longer useful to God, was terminated and buried.</p><p>According to our experience, we can testify that certain things may rise up against us. Although we are not happy with attack and opposition, all the attackers and opposers are useful in the hand of God. God uses them for our good, for the purpose of perfecting us. Once this goal has been achieved and the opposers are of no further use, the opposition will be terminated. Pharaoh not only drove the children of Israel out of Egypt; he also accompanied them to the Red Sea. Then after God&rsquo;s people crossed the Red Sea and Pharaoh was buried in the sea, they were separated from him forever. If some opposition or attack is allowed to remain, it must be that God still has a need for it. It must be necessary for our good. But one day this opposition will be terminated and buried.</p><p>In this message we have seen that Pharaoh was used by God to accomplish a thorough, complete, and perfect salvation of His chosen people. He was used to provide the environment for the Passover, the exodus, and the baptism. There was nothing left for God&rsquo;s people to do but to praise Him. Pharaoh&rsquo;s last struggle was over. Now that he had been laid to rest, there was no further struggle concerning him. Praise the Lord that even Pharaoh&rsquo;s last struggle helped to accomplish the full salvation of God&rsquo;s chosen people!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_099.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_101.html">Next</a> </body></html>
