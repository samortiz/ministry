   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE WHO KNOWS GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you know God and have experienced God's dealings, you will know at which point someone cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since you may have experienced dealing with God more than fifty times in certain matters, you can help others go through the same.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You are not just telling someone about the Bible, but are telling them about God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Last summer many famous people were speaking at a very popular spiritual conference.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Someone told me that I should attend because a certain one gave good messages during those few days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I went there once.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The subject of the message was "The Infilling of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Scriptures he used were quite adequate, and the parables and logic were also very good.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after he spoke for ten minutes, I asked myself, "Is this the so-called infilling of the Holy Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His preaching was good, but several laymen's words slipped out from his mouth; therefore, I knew that he did not know God in this matter at all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not know anything about the infilling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mere Bible knowledge cannot make one know God or minister God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must learn to take the way of the cross and must experience God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord did not say, "I am the Son of God, so I do not need to worry about God's will."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the contrary, He prayed to the Father once, twice, and even three times, until He finished the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then He said, "The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 18:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostle Paul also prayed to the Lord again and again until the Lord spoke to him: "My grace is sufficient for you" 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Later Paul was misunderstood by the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Corinthians express Paul's sorrow, while Philippians expresses Paul's joy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only these two books among Paul's epistles express his emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But I love to read the Epistles to the Corinthians more than the Epistle to the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Corinthians misunderstood him and said that he was not honest and that God consequently made him sick.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul did not ask God to remove his thorn in an attempt to avoid being laughed at by the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you" 2 Cor 12:8-9a .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because God had spoken, he did not ask God to change His will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul said, "Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me" 2 Cor 12:9b .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one can know God without first having dealings with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have told several brothers that if anyone wants to progress, the only way is to be dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not accept God's dealing, you will never progress.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you want Bible knowledge, all you have to do is study hard and receive some help from those who have Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if you want to know God, there is no way except to deal with God personally and be dealt with by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I often treasure very much the experience of those who know God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I know from their words that they are experienced in knowing God and that they truly know God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One sister from the West was truly a person who was waiting for the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many scholars of prophecy do not even know what it is to wait for the Lord's second coming!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever I went to her, I was afraid of doing anything, because as soon as she opened her mouth, I realized that she was a very experienced person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I remember that I prayed with her on the last day of 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She said, "Lord, are You really going to let 1925 go by?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do You really want to wait until 1926 before You will come back?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even on this last day, I will still ask You to come today."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I knew what she was praying for.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Several months later I met her on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She held my hand and said to me, "Brother, it is strange.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why has He still not come back today?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These words proved that she not only was a scholar of prophecy, but was also a person who had fellowship with God and who truly waited for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She knew God and was experienced in the matter of the Lord's coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once I talked to another sister.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I thought she was not very experienced in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But after a short conversation, I knew that she was very experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She was one who had passed through God's dealings and was a person who had dealt with God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Peking I met an old believer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He did not have much knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I did not think highly of some of his behavior either.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But he really knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While I was talking to him, he said, "Christ is responsible for everything."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was rather poor, but both he and his wife were happy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said that although he encountered many difficulties, Christ was responsible for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I asked him, "What then are you responsible for?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He said, "I am responsible for singing the praise."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is like King Jehoshaphat who, when going into battle, ordered the singers to sing before the battlefield 2 Chron 20:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I said, "Since you gave up everything for Christ, do you have any regrets at all?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He answered straightly, "You do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ is responsible for everything; I am not responsible for it."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You can see that regarding the matter of the Lord bearing our responsibility, he was far ahead of us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can only be his student.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is an experienced person regarding the Lord's bearing of our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What he has is not just Bible knowledge, but knowledge that he has learned from God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some have really experienced God's dealing, and they know what it is to be dealt with by God.</S>
