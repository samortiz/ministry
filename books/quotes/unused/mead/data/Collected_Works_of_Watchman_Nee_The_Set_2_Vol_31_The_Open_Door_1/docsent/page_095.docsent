   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Pu-yueh:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I received your card and was greatly comforted!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the Bible study in Lin-Jin, the Holy Spirit stirred up a love for the truth in people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then I went to the Hong-Dong Missionary School for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although I was only there a short time, the Lord's word gave people a desiring heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am now preparing to live in Houma.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mr. Ma Bu-ching is also preparing to come.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I want to spend a month by myself to pray and study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May the Lord preserve the quietness of my heart, spirit, and environment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The outward situation is very tense, but praise the Lord for giving us peace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I can still sit calmly to write to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Missionary Rung and Miss Chui-lan have returned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Presently, Missionary Rung is in Hong-Dong and Miss Chui-lan is in Hou-Ma.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Perhaps they will both go to Wen-Hsi to work with Feng-mei, or they might come to live in Chu-Wo.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you have time, please let us know where you are before communication is hindered so that we can pray for you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With regard to the work in Honan, I feel in my heart and spirit a desire for deeper fellowship with the Lord and deeper light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please pray for me!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the Lord bless you with peace.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Letter from Brother Duan Chai-ju, Tien-Shui</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Dear Brother Yu-chih in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since coming to the region of Lung-Nan and Tien-Shui in Kansu province, I have been meeting in the churches around here.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are more than ten churches, so I will not be able to go through them all until the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord is working in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unfortunately, I am a useless servant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am dry in my spirit and lack love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, what the Lord has given the brothers and sisters is precious and lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most of the churches belong to the Independent denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The brothers are very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In some places there are many people, but they do not even have a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When it is time for a meeting, they sit in the courtyard outdoors.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They do not have chairs, so they put a few boards together to make benches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A few days ago, we were having the table meeting in one place when it suddenly started snowing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Three and four-year-old children and seventy and eighty-year-old grandfathers knelt on the ground together with us to break the bread and eat the Lord's supper in the snow and freezing cold.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I saw this, I could not stop my tears from rolling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord enlarge my heart to suffer for Him, and may I be more willing to travel for Him in poor regions, accommodate humble people, and remember the poor!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How precious these ones are!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Please greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord for me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your spiritual brother,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Chai-ju</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Twenty-second day after the Chinese New Year</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Address omitted</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Recent Work in Ch'eng-tu One</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thank God for His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He brought us safely to Ch'eng-tu through the brothers' and sisters' prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was on a bus for two days.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Humanly speaking, I should have been dizzy with a backache, but God gave us exceptional peace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was more than we could understand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After two days on the road, it was as if I did not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I was not tired, and my back did not hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I feel more and more that I am unworthy because God's grace treats me so well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more I see my own corruption, the more I feel the greatness of God's grace!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Indeed, when the prodigal son returned, he did not do anything but enjoy grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I saw Brother Chao, Mrs. Chao, Mrs. Shen, and the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We were all rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I really hope to be edified and helped by the brothers and sisters here in Ch'eng-tu.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yu-chih</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>March 4</S>
