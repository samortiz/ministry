<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>The messages contained in this book concerning the key points on the home meetings were given in October and November, 1985 in Taipei, Taiwan. They have been translated from the Chinese.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">RECOVERING THE SPEAKING FUNCTION<br />
OF THE SAINTS</h1>
<p>In this chapter there are a number of specific things that I wish to discuss with you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL SAVED ONES PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
AND SPEAKING GOD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>First, let me speak about the change of our system. Since October 1984, the main goal of our changing the system was to recover the home meetings as they are revealed in the Bible. The Bible clearly says that every saved person is a member of the Body of Christ. Every member can function in the Body. This Body of Christ is the church. When I stand before you to speak, apparently, it is my mouth that speaks. But actually, it is my whole being which speaks.</p>
<p>If I put on an artificial nose, you can tell immediately that it is not real, because there is a difference between something artificial and something real. Artificial things are dead, while real things are living. If a person is living, he is simply living. Even when he is not moving, he still bears a living expression. If I were to stand before you, although I may not be moving, you could see that my nose, mouth, and face all bear a living expression. A brass or wooden statue is not like this. No matter how much it resembles a real person, everyone knows it is false as soon as it is placed before him.</p>
<p>A person has many members in his body. Whether the livingness of these members is strong or weak depends on whether his physical strength is full or lacking. If I am full of strength, then I will have a powerful appearance. On the other hand, if I am sick, I will have little vitality. Today the life of the Lord Jesus within us is powerful. We become His members through His life. In principle, we who have the life of Christ and who become the members of Christ&rsquo;s Body should be full of life and vitality.</p>
<p>But the condition of most Christians today is exactly the opposite. The problem is that the clergy-laity system has killed most of the functions of the saints. When they meet, the only active ones are the clergy. When it is time to sing, there is the song leader; when it is time to preach, there is the preacher; when it is time to pray, there is the prayer minister. It seems that in this technological age even religious worship has become a matter of division of labor; every person just takes care of his own part. This kills the function of the Christians. In changing our system, what we are doing is to change our meetings back to the biblical way. According to the Bible, in the meetings every saved one should preach the gospel. Acts 5:42 says, &ldquo;And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; They met from house to house, teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ. Here, to preach is to speak. On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were saved. Later another five thousand were added. After they were saved, these eight to ten thousand people met from house to house. At that time they probably had not been saved more than a month, yet they all began to preach the gospel and teach Jesus as the Christ. It is clear that in the beginning, when the Lord raised up the first church on the earth, everyone spoke; everyone was a speaker. On the positive side, the word of the Lord went out. On the negative side, this prevented any leader from being produced.</p>
<p>If everyone speaks in a meeting, no one can be a leader. On the other hand, if in a meeting you do not speak and I do not speak, but only one speaks, then that one becomes a leader. The more he leads, the better he becomes at leading. After a while, he will become an expert. At first he takes the lead only in the small meetings; gradually, he leads the big meetings. At first he leads in only one locality; gradually, he leads in a whole region. This is the way the clergy-laity system is developed. Dear brothers and sisters, speaking from our conscience, are not the co-workers among us a kind of clergy in our eyes? It is difficult for us to treat the co-workers as ordinary brothers, because the concept of clergy-laity has been deeply rooted in us already.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYONE SPEAKING, NO ONE LEADING</h2>
<p>The day before yesterday, I attended a morning watch in Hall One, where all the ones there were elderly brothers. I was very encouraged by it. There were about twenty-three to twenty-five brothers. Without exception, all of them were older ones. I have known many of them for twenty to thirty years. To my knowledge not one of them has ever spoken in a big meeting. But that morning when I arrived at the morning watch, I heard one brother giving a testimony about how he preached the gospel. As soon as he finished, another brother said, &ldquo;Let us read Galatians 5:16-19.&rdquo; I looked at that brother. He was not a leading brother, but he gave the order. In this small group truly everyone is a leader. After this the brothers began to read in a spontaneous way. There was nothing mechanical. This one would read a verse; then another one would read another. Some went back and read a verse over again. It was exactly as I said in a previous message: living reading, pray-reading, repeat-reading, emphasized reading, explain-reading, and so forth. They put all that into practice. I regretted very much that I did not bring a video camera there that morning to record the scene so that I could show it to you all.</p>
<p>After they finished reading, one brother said, &ldquo;Let us read the footnote.&rdquo; After reading the footnote, another brother said, &ldquo;Now let us open the Life-study message.&rdquo; They read it in a very living way. Although no one was directing them, the meeting was not dull. The entire meeting was like a ball game. One would not know when the ball would be passed to him. You could only see the ball flying back and forth. No one was a robot. When they came to a place that I felt was unnecessary to read, they skipped over it. When they reached a point that I felt needed emphasis, they read it again and emphasized it. It was as if I were giving the orders from within. They could not hear them, yet they were carrying them all out. This was a real miracle. They not only used the Recovery Version, the footnotes, and the Life-study messages in the proper order, but those twenty-odd brothers all opened their mouths. Those who gave the orders were not leading brothers. Among them you could not find a leader.</p>
<p>After listening to such a meeting with colorful dialects and diverse tones, I breathed a sigh of relief. Thank the Lord! This work has not been in vain. Outwardly speaking, these elderly brothers have reached the age where they are like decayed wood; there is nothing left in them that is good for carving. Their Mandarin was so poor that it was difficult to comprehend. But the content of their speaking was precious. They were very sweet. I never expected that this group of elderly brothers could produce such a satisfying result. I looked at my watch; it was already 7:29. Unfortunately, while I was waiting to speak a brief word when they finished at 7:30, a telephone call came from the United States. I ran to answer. After I finished the call in three or five sentences, I hurried back. By that time the chance was over; the meeting had already concluded.</p>
<p>I quickly grabbed two or three of them and said to them, &ldquo;Your morning watch was really good. For a long time, both in big meetings and in small gatherings, I have not been fed. But today when I attended your morning watch I had a good meal. I was supplied. You really did a good job. You have become a model of everything I taught the brothers and sisters to do in the past few years, including the way to read the Recovery Version, the way to read with emphasis, with repetition, and with explanation, the way to use the footnotes, and the way to use the Life-study messages effectively. You did all of them in the proper order. In your team not one member is silent. I encourage you all to go to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting and speak to all the people.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE RECOVERED<br />
UNTIL THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO HIERARCHY</h2>
<p>I was very touched by that morning watch. The Life-study messages were spoken by me. I myself corrected the manuscripts. But when those brothers began to read, &ldquo;To be watchful is just to check yourself, to see whether or not you are in spirit right now,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prayer is to bring yourself into the spirit, keeping yourself in spirit and staying in the spirit,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The most difficult time for us brothers to remain in spirit is when we speak to our wives. When we speak to other people it is easy to remain in spirit. But when we speak to our wives, we are no longer in spirit,&rdquo; I was thoroughly enlightened. I said Amen to those words over and over again.</p>
 <p>In the meetings it is very easy to stay in spirit. Likewise, when you are praying, it is easy to remain in spirit. But when it comes to speaking to your wife, it is difficult to remain in spirit. After attending so many meetings, it was hard for me to imagine that I could gain the supply from those elderly voices. &ldquo;To be watchful is just to check yourself, to see whether or not you are in spirit right now.&rdquo; &ldquo;Prayer is to bring yourself into the spirit, keeping yourself in spirit and staying in the spirit.&rdquo; It was all too good! I hope I will never forget these two sentences. May the Lord have mercy on us, that He could recover us to such an extent that there is no more hierarchy among us.</p>
<p>Today the Catholic population on the earth is almost one-quarter of that of the entire earth. If even half of the Catholics would speak, the whole earth would be affected. The power of everyone speaking is too great. Satan uses the religious system of worship to completely kill the Christians&rsquo; functioning. We need the Lord to recover us, even all the way back to the beginning. We need to have everyone speaking. In this way the function of everyone will be manifest. When we do away with the concept of hierarchy, there will be no more clergy and laity. When there is no more clergy and laity, the organization is gone. This will be a great salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING IN THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD DAILY<br />
FOR OUR SPEAKING</h2>
<p>The second thing I want to fellowship with you is that there are different kinds of speaking. In the past, when we came to the big meetings, as soon as the leading brothers arrived, our mouths were sealed. Do not think that since we are now free in the home meetings, we can talk about anything and everything. This is also wrong. For every meeting, the Lord has called us out of our family, our jobs, our burdens, and our tiredness into His name. In other words, we are meeting in the Lord. Here we have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. For this reason we must take care of two things: the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When we speak in the meetings, we should not speak about the news in the newspaper or about the merits and shortcomings of others. What we should speak in a Christian meeting must be the word of God. Here, we must be careful not to leave out the two words &ldquo;of God.&rdquo; If every person who comes to the meeting speaks but does not speak the word of God, the result is terrible. No matter what age we are, we must pay attention to this one thing: if we want to speak in the meetings we must be well acquainted with the Bible in our daily life. I believe many people can testify to this: before the Life-study messages were published, although the Bible was in our hands, we did not understand it.</p>
<p>The night before last, I attended a prayer meeting in Hall One. After we had finished praying, there were at least three or four testimonies about being helped by the Life-study messages. One sister said that in the sisters&rsquo; morning watch they used Matthew 1:1: &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&rdquo; They opened to the footnote, which said that &ldquo;Isaac is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the One who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham....Isaac also, as a type of Christ, did mainly two things: he obeyed his father even unto death and was resurrected from death,...and he took Rebekah, a Gentile woman, as his wife....Christ, in fulfilling this type, was put to death and offered to God and was resurrected from death, and He is taking the church as His bride out of the Gentiles.&rdquo; Then they read another note which said that <em>the son of David</em> refers to &ldquo;Solomon...a type of Christ....&rdquo; A sister from a denomination was also there in that morning watch. She was shocked. Previously, when she read Matthew 1:1, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham,&rdquo; that was all that she saw. Whether she understood it or not, that was all that there was. She never imagined that there was so much in this one verse and that it could be so rich. I was told that after that, our sister began to attend the sisters&rsquo; morning watch regularly.</p>
<p>Since the release of the Life-study messages, the Bible has been an open book to us. When I wrote the footnotes, my main emphasis was to supply life. My second aim was to help people to understand the Bible. I have supplied footnotes for all the difficult verses in the Bible. I know that all of you here tonight love the Lord. The Lord Himself said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word&rdquo; (John 14:23). If we do not read the Bible but are rather ignorant of the Lord&rsquo;s Word, how can we keep it? Since we love the Lord, we should keep His word. If we want to keep His word, we must read His Word. At the very least, we must read a portion every day. If we would do this every day, little by little the word will be accumulated in us and we will have a rich store of the Lord&rsquo;s word. If everyone reads the Lord&rsquo;s Word in this way, the truth among us will greatly increase, and we will become a house of scholars. Then when we open our mouths, the scholarly fragrance will be there.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF BOTH THE HOLY BIBLE AND<br />
THE HOLY SPIRIT IN OUR SPEAKING</h2>
<p>When we come to the meetings to speak the word of the Lord, we do so by two tracks. One track is the Holy Bible, and the other track is the Holy Spirit. First, we must be familiar with the Lord&rsquo;s Word. Then we need to speak by the Spirit. With these two tracks, when our speaking is according to the Bible and according to the Spirit, we will not be off course. Thank the Lord, over the past ten years, the New Testament has been completely opened to us. Now, the Bible is no longer difficult to understand. When we come to a difficult passage, all we need to do is to open up the Recovery Version, read the footnotes, and then study the Life-study messages, and we will be clear.</p>
<p>The reason the elderly brothers&rsquo; morning watch at Hall One is so successful is that they have been coming together for morning watch for twenty to thirty years now. This is an experienced team. They come together to &ldquo;play ball&rdquo; every day. After twenty or thirty years, even those who could not play at first would have learned by now. This is why we need to come together frequently. Every Saturday we need to come to the home meeting. When we come, we must not come empty-handed, but we must come with our two treasures: the Recovery Version and the Life-study messages. Once everyone settles down, we may start reading these treasures. We need to speak the word of the Bible together; we also need to speak by the Spirit together. If a train runs on two tracks it will run smoothly. For us, we must speak the word of God by means of these two tracks.</p><h2 class="head1">REDEEMING THE TIME TO EAT AND DRINK<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>Third, I want to fellowship with all of you about how to use the Life-study messages. We have been exercising here for half a year and have learned some things. But one of the problems with the home meetings is that people are on different levels. No two persons are on the same level. In a home meeting there may be those who have been saved for many years, those who are newly saved, and some who are not yet saved. There may even be some who are hearing the gospel for the first time. Although everyone is different, please do not be bothered. The key to meeting is not to be afraid of anything. For example, we may be scheduled to read Galatians 5:16-19 this Saturday. Even if some gospel friends show up, we can still use these verses to preach the gospel. The home meetings are all in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; homes. One sits here; another sits there. One comes early; another comes late. Everyone speaks a little, and there is no need for any formality. This is the best point about the home meetings.</p>
<p>There is another principle that I would ask you to keep. Every time we come to meet, we are meeting around the Lord&rsquo;s Word, contacting the Word and getting help from the Lord. The help the Lord gives us never comes apart from the Word. This is like the current of electricity flowing into a building; it never comes apart from the wires. If there are no wires, the electricity in the generating plant will never come over to the house. The Lord&rsquo;s Word is like the wire. In every meeting we should eat and drink the Lord&rsquo;s word. This is one point that we must grasp firmly. The home meeting only lasts an hour and a half. If we do not make good use of the time, before we know it, forty-five minutes will be gone. If we let a few say some more unrelated things here and there, another half hour will fly away. After the one and a half hours, although the atmosphere is good and everyone is happy, no one received any practical help. If one does not get any supply in the meeting, he probably will not want to come again.</p>
<p>Every home meeting must have some core members. The core members should grasp the opportunity. Do not let time slip away. Instead, bring out the Lord&rsquo;s Word and read it. Perhaps we are not too accustomed to doing this. Our habit is to sing a hymn, have some prayers, read the Bible, and then give some testimonies. We are not accustomed to carrying on a meeting according to the Lord&rsquo;s Word. We must all exercise to get into the Lord&rsquo;s Word properly in the meetings. This does not mean that we cannot give testimonies of our daily life in the meetings. It only means that we must testify according to the Lord&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR TESTIMONIES NEEDING TO BE GOVERNED<br />
BY THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>Let us take the morning watch I just spoke of as an example. A brother said, &ldquo;It is most difficult for us brothers to stay in spirit when we speak to our wives.&rdquo; At that point a brother should have followed with a testimony like this: &ldquo;You are absolutely right. Last night as I was speaking to my wife, although I did not lose my temper or get angry, under the light now I see that what I said to my wife was totally not in spirit. At that time I talked about how this brother and that sister were, how the meeting was, how the church was. I spoke about spiritual things, but I was not in my spirit.&rdquo; This kind of testimony is very precious.</p>
<p>If we do not have a proper testimony along this track, it is better for us not to speak. Sometimes the testimonies given by the brothers and sisters in the meetings are not on the track of the Lord&rsquo;s Word. They speak about the North Pole and about the South Pole; there is no track at all. If we do not take the Lord&rsquo;s Word as the track in our testimonies, our speaking will not carry any weight.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOME MEETINGS BEING MEETINGS FOR<br />
SUPPLYING SPIRITUAL FOOD</h2>
<p>In the home meetings we should bring out the Lord&rsquo;s Word and have everyone read it. If there is anything that we do not understand, we should refer to the footnotes together. First pick up the facts, and then find the explanation. Read in a living way. After reading the Recovery Version, read the Life-study messages. The home meeting is not a Bible class in a seminary. We do not need to go through every chapter, every verse, and every word. The home meetings are &ldquo;eating&rdquo; meetings. When we invite people to come, we should only think about how to feed them. It is like going to the market to buy a chicken to cook for the family. First, you need to pluck the feathers and peel off the skin. Then you need to cut off the beak and the claws. Last, you need to cook the plump, tender part of the chicken in a tasty way. Only then can you bring it to the table and invite your guests to dine.</p>
<p>In every home meeting, I have noticed that the brothers and sisters offer people an abundance of physical food. Everyone eats very well. But I am afraid that after attending such a home meeting, many people still go away hungry in spirit. We all need to change our concept. Every Saturday, when we come together, do not be so polite. The most important thing is to spread out the Lord&rsquo;s word as a feast. You brothers and sisters who are the core members should be well prepared on Saturday afternoon for the meeting that evening. Look up some verses in the Recovery Version. Read the footnotes carefully. You do not need to read all the footnotes; just read the important ones. Whatever you do, you are preparing a meal. When the people come, you should know how to bring out the tasty dishes. In this way everyone will be well fed and happy.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILDING PEOPLE UP IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>When you help people to read the footnotes and the Life-study messages, you must be careful. Do not give others the impression that you are a leader or a core member. We must learn this one thing: never assume the position of a leader. You must be very natural. When no one has anything to say, you start by speaking something in order to help everyone to exercise. Those who are there for the first time will not be accustomed to this. For this reason you must bring them slowly into this kind of exercise. A home meeting of eight to ten people is very easy to help in this way. We must practice this regularly over a period of time. Do this once a week, fifty-two weeks a year. I believe that if you brothers are faithful and patient to practice this steadily for a year, surely many people will be built up by the end of that year. We only need to try it for a year. Many results will be seen. Once people are built up, they will be very useful. Anyone will then be able to speak for the Lord. They can speak for the Lord at home, to their neighbors, friends, and relatives. The effect will be far reaching.</p>
<p>You all know of the American soft drink company Coca-Cola. Apparently, they are selling a drink to people and earning a very small amount of money per drink. But when you add the small amounts together, it is a lot of money. If we all speak the Lord&rsquo;s word today, this will have a great impact. In September, Taipei had a &ldquo;gospel week.&rdquo; There were no big gospel meetings, but for one week the brothers and sisters went out to contact people one-on-one. Everyone spoke. You brought 1,104 people to the Lord. This is the best proof. We should not underestimate the &ldquo;small&rdquo; things. What we are after is the &ldquo;widespreading.&rdquo; If everyone would rise up to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, the gospel will spread out quickly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD IN THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>If three gospel friends come to your home meeting, you cannot ignore them. You can still use the verses from Galatians. But when you use them, you must use them in the way of gospel preaching. You need to learn to say, &ldquo;The Bible says, &lsquo;Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&rsquo; We human beings are all fallen. We are born in the flesh, and the flesh is fallen....&rdquo; Your speaking can go from the flesh to the spirit. This is a very good gospel message. You may say, &ldquo;When we live in ourselves, we cannot escape corruption. We have no way to overcome the flesh. But when we believe in the Lord Jesus and we call on His name, His Spirit comes into ours. He produces fruits of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and self-control.&rdquo; If you speak this way, people will certainly be able to understand, and they will certainly admire the gospel. To preach the gospel in this way will also nourish the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>I hope that you brothers and sisters would also learn to sing hymns. For the long run we all need to exercise to sing the hymns together in a harmonious way. I believe the dormant saints will be recovered and the newly saved ones will be added. We need to do our best to attach ourselves to them. The foundation for the building of the church is the home meetings. We all need to change our concept and habit. From now on, we will not have any more hierarchy. All are members of the Body. Each one must function actively.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">A THREE-IN-ONE LIVING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:1, 3, 24, 31-32; 12:7-8; Gen. 20:7; Neh. 8:9; 2 Sam. 12:1</h1>
<p>It seems as if all of us have nothing else to do besides hurrying to meetings, busily going to meetings, and attending meetings. Actually, it is not that we have nothing else to do. Rather, we are those who have been called by the Lord Jesus out of all our busy engagements to meet together. The Lord has not called us to meet together in the meeting hall. Instead, He calls us to meet together into His name, that is, into Himself. We worship and enjoy Him together by meeting in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A THREE-IN-ONE LIVING:<br />
BURNING THE INCENSE, LIGHTING THE LAMPS,<br />
AND SINGING PRAISE</h2>
<p>The hymn that we sang tonight, hymn 791, shows us that in the Old Testament the priests had to do three things: burn the incense, light the lamps, and sing. For us today, to burn the incense is to pray. Our praying is our burning of the incense. For us today, to light the lamp is to read the Word. By this, the light of God shines in us. And for us today, to sing is just to sing hymns.</p>
<p>Although I do not know much about music, and although I do not have a good voice or an ear for music, I do love to sing. Both Ephesians chapter five and Colossians chapter three say that when you are filled within, you will be full of grace to sing with your hearts and speak to one another. You will be speaking the word and singing the word. This is why I urge you young people to learn to sing the hymns. You have to practice singing in a harmonious way and to exercise your throats. Even you older ones have to do the same. It does not matter if you sing out of tune. You have to have a singing that is full of the Lord, full of the Spirit, and full of life. You must sing out the feeling in the spirit. All of us must be like the Old Testament priests. We must have a three-in-one living: burning the incense, lighting the lamps, and singing. Every day we must pray, read the Word, and sing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIG MEETINGS NEVER REPLACING<br />
THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Recently, in all of our speaking we have not left this one subject: the home meetings. I am not only talking about the home meetings here; I am talking about them in the United States also. I spoke about them in the Chinese-speaking meeting, and I also spoke about them in the English-speaking meeting. I did not talk about the big meetings. All I talked about was the home meetings. Even in my dreams I am still shouting about the home meetings. I will never forget about the home meetings. The burden for the home meetings in me has not diminished; rather, it has increased. I am very glad to see all of you here again, because I can discharge my burden to you once again. I hope that after these few meetings in this conference, all my burden will be passed on to you. For this reason, I beg you to share somewhat in my burden.</p>
<p>Tonight we want to talk about the key to the home meetings. What is the key to the home meetings? It is difficult to state it in one word. But I believe after the past eight or nine months, all the brothers and sisters have come to realize the importance of the home meetings. Regardless of how many thousands and tens of thousands of messages you have heard, they can never replace the home meetings. The big meetings can never replace the home meetings, because the home meetings afford people the opportunity to speak. In the beginning of October we had three conferences. In them we spoke concerning &ldquo;The Full Knowledge of the Word of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Everyone Speaking the Word of God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Meeting to Speak the Word of God.&rdquo; I believe we all saw that God desires very much that all His children would speak.</p>
<p>All the mothers know that as soon as a child is born, the thing she is most anxious about is to hear the child&rsquo;s voice. If after six months the child would still not utter any sound, the mother would be very anxious. But one day, if the child suddenly opens his mouth and says &ldquo;Mama,&rdquo; the mother will be beside herself with joy. She will go around to tell people that her child can now say &ldquo;Mama.&rdquo; Every mother just loves to hear her child speak. It does not matter if the words are all nonsense; they will still be music to the mother&rsquo;s ears. This is a very good illustration.</p>
<p>We have been regenerated to become the children of God. But if we would not speak for a year, two years, eight years, or even twenty years, would that not be a strange thing? What is happening to you? Forgive me for saying this. We have been talking about the home meetings for a year already. The main purpose of the home meetings is to promote speaking by everyone. Yet there are still many who would not speak. They are the &ldquo;dumb old babes.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE AGE HAVING CHANGED&mdash;THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
BEING THE LORD&rsquo;S WAY TODAY</h2>
<p>These dear brothers and sisters are not only reluctant to speak; they simply cannot understand what this Brother Lee has been doing. Since the end of last year when he came back to us, he has changed around our perfectly good big meetings. It is so comfortable to sit in a big meeting to listen to a message. But now he has divided us up and has put eight or nine of us into a home. At the same time he repeatedly exhorts us and forces us to speak. I am not interested in the home meetings. I just wish that we could go back to the big meetings. Are these not words that are in your hearts? I am very sympathetic towards all of you. I know that you are all either very busy with your jobs, pressed by obligations, or entangled in household affairs. You are tied up from Monday until Saturday. Finally the long awaited Sunday is here, and all you want to do is relax a little bit in the meetings. You like to listen leisurely to others singing, praying, and reading the Bible to you followed by having a good message delivered to you. How comfortable this is!</p>
<p>But now, Brother Lee has changed our meetings around. Now we have to go to the home meetings. There is no one there who can pray. There is no one there who can give a message. When we read, we have to pray-read, repeat-read, explain-read, and a lot of other things. On top of that we still have to speak. I am not a professional preacher. I have never been to a seminary. This is killing me! Although such words have not come out of your mouth yet, I am not a dumb man; I have been a doctor in this line for fifty-nine years. I have much bedside experience. When I look at your faces and check around a little bit, I know immediately where your sickness lies. I do not believe too many of you would say, &ldquo;We agree wholeheartedly with the way of the home meetings. We are for speaking in the home meetings. Even if I cannot speak, I will still learn to speak and to sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, let me say this to you: The age has changed. The Lord is going on. Today this is the way that the Lord has taken. The Bible shows us clearly that at Pentecost, immediately after the Holy Spirit was poured out, when men were saved and the church was established, the home meetings were there. Every one of them preached Jesus, spoke about Jesus, and taught others concerning Jesus. The book of Acts tells us that the word of the Lord grew and was victorious. The situation then was different from what we have today. We have been preaching the word in Taiwan for thirty-six years. But the word of the Lord is still not prospering here in Taiwan. This is because there are few who speak; there is not much speaking. Now we all have to rise up to speak. Everyone must come to speak the word of the Lord. This is the characteristic of the home meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF BLESSING BEING TO SPEAK<br />
IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In Numbers 11:29 Moses said, &ldquo;Oh that all Jehovah&rsquo;s people were prophets.&rdquo; Not only did Moses say this in the Old Testament; in the New Testament Paul gave a clearer word: &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:31). To the Corinthians Paul said, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy&rdquo; (v. 1). Here it says we have to pursue love and to desire earnestly spiritual gifts. But more than that, we have to desire to prophesy. Do you realize that you must speak? It is a big loss not to be able to speak. The home meeting is to afford you an opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>All the mothers know that no child is born with the ability to give a long speech. A child learns to speak by practicing every day. After a few years he will speak properly and will be able to express himself adequately. Speaking is just like writing; if you do not practice it, you will forget it as time goes by. Do not think that because you cannot speak, you should not speak. Even if we cannot speak, we should still keep on talking. The more we speak, the more we will be able to speak. You have to realize that there is a big difference between speaking and not speaking in the meetings. If you are under a powerful speaking ministry which ministers the Lord&rsquo;s word to you, and you are being moved and edified, your experience tells you that even to say a small Amen from your heart will make a big difference.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters may have been meeting with us for ten, fifteen, or even twenty years. Not only do they refuse to speak; they would not even say an Amen. Once these perpetually silent ones open their mouths and say an Amen, they will be nourished and edified; they will sense something special. If they would go further to stand up in the meeting to speak a few words, their speaking will give them immediate comfort, joy, nourishment, and strength. This will be much better than listening to a few messages. I believe many of you here have this experience. This proves that to speak in the meetings is a way of blessing.</p><h2 class="head1">ATTENDING THREE IMPORTANT MEETINGS A WEEK</h2>
<p>Man is communal. Christians are all the more communal. None of us would like to live by himself on a high mountain. We like to see people and to speak to people. Once we have the life of God within us, we spontaneously love other Christians. We cannot explain why this is so, but it is a fact. It does not matter what color skin they have, whether they are black, white, red, brown, or yellow. As long as they are brothers, we love them. Some have asked me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, how many brothers and sisters do you have?&rdquo; How should I answer? How many brothers and sisters do I really have? More than hundreds of thousands! They are countless! Wherever I go today, I have brothers and sisters!</p>
<p>Christianity has robbed the Christians of this great blessing. When they go to the worship service, even those sitting beside them would not acknowledge them. After the service is over, everyone goes home. I attended a worship service for two years in a denomination. Besides the pastor, I did not talk to anyone. I was not the only one who was like that. All the others were the same. In that kind of setting, no one needs to speak to another. But if you come to a home meeting with eight brothers sitting in a brother&rsquo;s living room, it would be impossible for you not to speak. At least you have to greet each other. Once you greet each other, the blessing comes! In time you begin to know me and I begin to know you, and we become acquainted with each other&rsquo;s condition and difficulties. Spontaneously a mutual love and care will be developed.</p>
<p>But this is not all. There are many things that you can practice in the home meetings. In the big meetings you can not pray, but in the home meetings you can pray. In the big meetings you cannot speak, but in the home meetings you can speak. In the big meetings you cannot sing, but in the home meetings you can sing. All these are functions that cannot be fulfilled by the big meetings. For this reason I advise you not to despise the home meetings. Since we are saved and have become the children of God, we should not give up this blessing. I know that you are all very busy. According to the present arrangement of the church in Taipei there are not too many meetings. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning there is a meeting to learn the truth; we must all go there to learn the truth. Besides that, we have the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day evening; this is a meeting to remember the Lord, and it is very proper for us to attend that meeting. Other than these two meetings we have a home meeting once a week. This is a must for all of us. Attending such home meetings will refresh us all the time.</p>
<p>For me to go now to a service to listen to a pastor speak for an hour is a punishment. But if I go to the home meeting, where I meet the brothers and sisters, where we pray, sing, and fellowship together, there is much refreshment, enjoyment, and satisfaction! I hope all the brothers and sisters would attend these three important meetings. We should learn the truths, remember the Lord, and build up one another through the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR DESIRE FOR THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
ARISING FROM A FRESH LOVE TOWARDS THE LORD</h2>
<p>If anyone does not love the home meetings, he must forgive me to say that he must have a problem with his love towards the Lord. I am afraid such a one does not really love the Lord. I am not condemning you, picking on you, or exposing your shortcomings. I admit that you do love the Lord, but your love today is not fresh. I honestly believe that if your love towards the Lord is still fresh, you will surely love the home meetings. I myself have the same experience. For a while I did not like to see the brothers and sisters. I became tired of meetings. Invariably my love towards the Lord was not fresh at such times. However, once I would pray a little, be enlightened a little in my prayer, and confess my sins and plead for the cleansing of the blood, I immediately would be refreshed. The first thing that comes to me after I am refreshed is that I want to go to the meetings! This is why I say that to be tired of the home meetings shows that our love towards the Lord is no longer fresh.</p>
<p>In the Christian&rsquo;s experience, if there is a problem with one&rsquo;s daily life, his love towards the Lord will not be fresh. This is a symptom of a disease. When your love towards the Lord is fresh, when you have such a sweet fellowship with Him in the morning, you wish that the evening would come sooner so that you may go to the meeting. It seems as if you cannot wait until the evening. As soon as you finish with your business in the afternoon, you rush through your dinner so that you can make it to the meeting. But sometimes the situation is exactly the opposite. We are afraid of the meetings. We do not want to see the faces of the brothers and sisters. This is a symptom. It means that you are spiritually sick. Sometimes, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, the sickness is over in three or five days. But if the sickness persists, then you must beware. If you are weak and underweight for a long time, and you cannot diagnose the problem, perhaps you have developed spiritual cancer.</p>
<p>The best way is to go to the Lord to contact Him. Once you contact Him, you will discover your sins. Even our reluctance to go to meetings is a sin. We will see that even our lack of prayer and our not walking according to the Spirit are sins. If we would confess our sins before the Lord, we will be forgiven and there will be an immediate revival within. Once we are revived, we will want to come to the meetings. In simple terms, the key to the home meetings is a fresh love towards the Lord. Whenever we feel that we are not fresh, we must contact the Lord and confess our sins. His blood will cleanse us. This cleansing is always effective; it is an instant cure. Nothing will annul this law. If we would do this, we will live daily in the fellowship with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING ALL THE TIME TO SAY &ldquo;O LORD, AMEN&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Whether young or old, all of us must exercise to do one thing: from the time we wake up in the morning until we go to bed at night, as long as we are awake and breathing, we must set our minds on the Lord. Perhaps you would say, &ldquo;I want to do this. But whenever I become busy, I forget about this.&rdquo; I admit that sometimes I forget the Lord also. But one thing which I have learned makes it hard for me to forget the Lord: I always call on the Lord. If you would call &ldquo;O Lord&rdquo; all the time, you will be reminded of Him. Sometimes you also have to learn to say Amen. Many times we become busy with something. While we are busy with that thing, we become buried in it for two or three hours. The Lord is gone, and we are lost in that thing. I have learned a secret: no matter how busy I am, I would learn always to say &ldquo;O Lord, Amen.&rdquo; This kind of calling brings me into fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p>Some of you drive to work. While you are driving, you can call on the Lord. Sometimes the road is too congested. The cars ahead of you are moving too slowly. At such times you have to exercise yourself to say &ldquo;O Lord, Amen.&rdquo; You may even joke a little, &ldquo;O Lord, the cars are slow. But You are not slow.&rdquo; The Lord is indeed not slow. He never fails us. If your mind is turned, the songs will come: &ldquo;He faileth not, for He is God; He faileth not, His grace how good!&rdquo; If you have such a good enjoyment during the day, you will surely love to come to the meetings. If all the brothers and sisters would live such a life, everyone would surely love the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SPEAK IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>When we attend the home meetings, we have to be ready to speak. We all know that in the home meetings we cannot talk about the things of the world. If you speak about such things, no one would say Amen to you. But to speak spiritual things is difficult for us, because we have not learned to speak this way, and we cannot speak this way. Herein lies the key: when we come to the home meetings, everyone must learn to speak God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPENDING TEN MINUTES EVERY MORNING<br />
TO READ THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>There is another key to the home meeting: we must be persons who read the Bible. An illiterate person cannot speak very well. Only those who are learned can speak well. A Christian&rsquo;s speaking depends on his reading of the Bible. I am not asking you to read a lot. Every saved person should spend at least ten minutes a day to read the Bible. You cannot spend less than ten minutes. I advise you that the best time to read is the morning. Allocate at least ten minutes a day to read the Bible. Take all of God&rsquo;s words into your being. Be filled with His word to such an extent that it is no longer you reading the Bible, but the Bible reading itself to you from within you.</p>
<p>If we love the Lord, we have to go to bed as early as possible. I discovered the same thing with both Chinese and American children: they do not like to go to bed. Not only do the children not like to go to bed; both young people and old folks alike do not like to go to bed early. In the evening they always want to drag on longer. In order to be able to wake up in the morning, I suggest that you go to bed early. As soon as you wake up, the first thing to do is to go to the Word. This will make a great difference. If you read ten minutes a day, you may not notice much difference; you may only have three or five verses a day. But as the months go by, there will be more of a deposit in you, and the Bible will open itself to you in a wonderful way.</p>
<p>Your reading of the Bible the first time will lay a foundation for you. Later when someone expounds that verse in the meeting, your impression will be much deeper. When you come to the same passage the second time, there will be more of God&rsquo;s word in you. If you would do this for ten minutes a day, in ten years how rich a person you will be! The deposited word in you will make you a scholar. For example, <em>born of a woman</em> is a biblical expression. If you would read the Bible every day, terms such as <em>incarnation, mingling,</em> and other biblical expressions will be constituted into you. When you need them, they will all come back. It is correct to say that reading the Bible is a difficult thing. It is equally correct to say that reading the Bible is an easy thing. All you have to do is go and read.</p><h2 class="head1">ATTENDING THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
WITH A SPIRIT OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>When you go to the home meeting, you must go with a spirit of prayer. Whether anyone arrives before you at the meeting, and regardless of how many people there are in the meeting, as soon as you arrive, you should begin to pray. We have to speak in the home meetings. But the first speaking is not to man, but to God. The minute you enter the place, start praying. When all seven or eight eventually arrive, they will spontaneously pray. In this way the home meeting becomes a prayer meeting. At least for ten to fifteen minutes, everyone will enter into this kind of prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING SINGING HYMNS FIRST AT HOME</h2>
<p>Again, the key to the home meetings is in singing the hymns. We all have to learn to sing. It would be good if after this week&rsquo;s home meeting, an announcement would be made for next week&rsquo;s reading. There is no need to use a whole Life-study message; we may pick out just two paragraphs. Everyone would then go home and prepare themselves in the assigned portions by pray-reading and praying. Some related hymns can be selected, and one can practice singing them first at home. When you are thus prepared, you can come to the home meeting praying, singing, and speaking. When you come to a point or a sentence in the message that touches you, you can start singing. Your singing must bring everyone into the enjoyment. Still, you must learn to go along with the weaker ones. You must also learn to relate to the lowly ones. This is a key.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FINDING ENJOYMENT BY DIVING INTO<br />
THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>If you would take all the points I have just mentioned and put them into practice, your home meeting will surely be living. This will fulfill the leading the Lord has given us. There will be no leader, no chairman, and no one to give orders. There will be no more forms such as singing first, reading later, then preaching last, or anything like that. Praise the Lord that He has opened every book of the New Testament to us. How I wish that we could go over these books one by one! Do not be afraid that you will lose something by skipping over portions of the Life-study messages. Our storehouse is filled with chicken, duck, rice, and flour. You cannot swallow them all at once. All you need to do is to select a portion as a meal. Feast on that portion with ample reading, singing, praying, and testifying. This will give you the adequate satisfaction.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, you have heard so much now about the home meetings. Would you now consider the home meetings to be easy or not? If you still consider them a difficult thing to do, then I do not know what else I can say to you. We all have to dive into the home meetings. It does not matter whether we can play the ball or not. When we are watching others play, we will surely have a lot of criticisms. To us this player is bad at shooting and that one is awkward in running. But once we get onto the field, not only will our criticisms be gone; we will actually begin to enjoy the game. The same is true with everything else. In a concert, if I am one of the players, or if I have any part in the performance, I will enjoy it much more.</p>
<p>Although there is only one home meeting a week, there are fifty-two weeks in a year. Every week you have such an opportunity to breathe some fresh air and bask a little in the warm sun. Here you can sit down and have a cup of tea. Before the Lord, you can be refreshed, renewed, supplied, and comforted every week. Here you can share your burden with the brothers and sisters. You can all pray together, trust in the Lord together, and fellowship in the spirit together. This is truly the greatest enjoyment and the greatest blessing the Lord has ordained for His people here on earth.</p>
<p>Those in the world do not have the Lord. They do not have truth, or light, or the word of life. They indulge themselves in card games and dancing. But we have the Lord, we have life, and we have the Lord&rsquo;s word. We live a communal life. We fellowship together, and we know how to pray. This is the greatest blessing. I hope that we can all lay hold of these few points. In this way it is easy to conduct a home meeting.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT FORSAKING THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>I have told you before that the home meetings should not have any leader. Now I would add that there should not even be any so-called core members. Everyone should be a capable member. Everyone of us loves the Lord. Everyone has fellowship with the Lord and receives enlightenment from the Lord. If there is sin, we ask for forgiveness. Constantly we maintain a fellowship with the Lord and always exercise ourselves to say &ldquo;O Lord, Amen.&rdquo; In this way we remain fresh within. The Lord is calling us every day. Daily He is calling us out from all the things other than Himself. He is gathering us into Himself. All that is needed are two or three that are gathered into His name. The Lord is longing for us to come constantly to Him and to fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>Besides this, the Lord has given us a Bible. We should spend ten minutes a day to read it. In time we will experience an inward renewal and transformation, and we will have an unveiled face, beholding the Lord&rsquo;s glory. We will then be transformed into His image, from glory to glory. Then when you come to the meeting, you will not be without words. You will surely have songs to sing, words to speak, Bible verses to share, and testimonies to give.</p>
<p>Last, I want to add one more point. Every home meeting should have one or two persons to give a conclusion, summarizing that portion of the Scripture or Life-study message. This conclusion does not have to be long. At most it should take ten minutes, but it should not be less than five minutes. This kind of summary is like cream on the pie. When we invite others for a meal, after everyone is filled, we serve them some pudding or a cup of almond tea. This will top off their satisfaction. If our home meeting is like this, it would be impossible for people not to be attracted. Please take my word. If we come to the home meetings in this way, our number will surely increase.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, you must change your concept. The home meeting is not difficult at all. I have thoroughly considered this matter. I have also practiced this way again and again. In the end I have to say that it is easy to have the home meetings. We are all Chinese here. Please tell me, is there anyone among us who ever complains that it is difficult to learn Chinese? As long as you are willing, and as long as you would put into practice in your daily life all the key points concerning the home meetings, you will not sense any difficulty. Please remember the words I gave you the last time: &ldquo;Heaven can be annulled, and the earth can pass away, but the home meeting must not be forsaken.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING PRIESTS AND KINGS BASED UPON<br />
BEING PROPHETS</h2>
<p>God desires that there be three kinds of ministries among His people. The first is the priesthood, the second is the kingship, and the third is the prophethood. In the Bible we see that both the priests and the kings require the prophets. If a priest cannot speak, he will be a weak priest. Who was the first prophet in the Bible? It was Abraham. Genesis 20:7 tells us that Abraham was a prophet. Hence, he could pray for the household of Abimelech. The emphasis with the prophets is not to speak prophecy, but to speak for God.</p>
<p>In Exodus 7:1 God said to Moses, &ldquo;I have made you God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother will be your prophet.&rdquo; The definition of a prophet is a spokesman, one who speaks for another. Since we are God&rsquo;s people, we are the descendants of Abraham. As such, we should be prophets. If in our meeting no one speaks, how can we say that we are priests? The first thing for the priests to do is to pray before God. This is the burning of the incense.</p>
<p>The second thing the priests do is to light the lamp. After the lamp has burned for a while, the wick becomes black and the light does not shine so brightly. Hence, there is the need to trim the burnt wick and to add more oil. The oil is the Holy Spirit. Daily we need to burn the incense by praying, and daily we need to trim our lamp by reading the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>The third thing the priests do is to sing praises. In stanzas four, five, and six of hymn 791, these three things are put together:</p>
<p class="hbody">I&rsquo;ll offer prayers as incense burns,<br />
Christ&rsquo;s resurrection bring therein,<br />
God&rsquo;s wish thus meet, His heart give joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ll rejoice with Him.</p>
<p class="hbody">I&rsquo;ll read His Word, His light receive,<br />
E&rsquo;en as the lamp before Him lit,<br />
His holy light illumining me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To others I&rsquo;ll transmit.</p>
<p class="hbody">Unto the Lord His praise I&rsquo;ll sing<br />
As holy priests their songs did raise;<br />
O may my heart be filled with Him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His love and grace to praise.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #791</p>
<p>The first priest in the Bible was Abraham. Ezra was another priest. Ezra 7:11 says, &ldquo;Ezra the priest, the scribe.&rdquo; In chapter eight of Nehemiah he read God&rsquo;s law to God&rsquo;s people and led everyone back to the Old Testament. He was a priest, and he was also a scribe who spoke for God.</p>
<p>In 2 Samuel chapter twelve we see that Nathan was a prophet. King David became weak and sinned. Hence, he needed a prophet to come and help him. God sent Nathan the prophet to rebuke him. Being enlightened by Nathan&rsquo;s rebuke, David repented. All these verses show us that today we are priests and we are kings. If we do not speak, our priestly service will be very weak. When we are a prophet, it helps us to be a priest and a king. This is why the Bible says, &ldquo;Would God that all the Lord&rsquo;s people were prophets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul also said that we can all prophesy one by one (1 Cor. 14:31), and 1 Corinthians chapter twelve says that the Holy Spirit operating in each person has a manifestation. The first manifestation is the word of wisdom. The second is the word of knowledge (vv. 7-8). If I can speak a word of wisdom and a word of knowledge, this proves that I have the Spirit. We have to exercise to speak. We also have to exercise to read the Bible. After much reading, the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge will come. We will all become priests and kings. If we are not prophets, we can never be priests or kings properly. The latter two ministries are based upon our being prophets.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4; Eph. 5:18-19; 1 Thes. 5:16-19</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to speak concerning the key points on the home meetings. I want to have some fellowship with you based on my experience and observation.</p>
<p>If we are burdened for the home meetings, the first thing we must take care of is that which is recorded in Romans 8:4. As those who have received the grace of the divine life and have the law of the Spirit of life within us, we should spontaneously walk and behave ourselves fully according to the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION<br />
OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>We have been speaking on this subject for a long time, and it is very familiar to us. But I still have the burden to speak more about it, because this teaching is too profound. It is necessary to repeat it again and again. In order to help you to understand what it is to walk according to the Spirit, let me give you an illustration. The Chinese ethical philosophy has been recognized as the highest in human history, especially &ldquo;the way of the great learning&rdquo; taught by Confucius, where the development of the &ldquo;bright virtue&rdquo; was spoken of as the enlightenment of the inward heart. To explain this in today&rsquo;s simple terms, it means that the way of the great learning lies in the manifestation and development of that bright virtue within man. Apart from the Bible, the Chinese philosophy of Confucius is indeed the highest teaching. However, after I was saved, I began to compare this teaching with the Bible. When I did, I began to praise the Lord because the Bible contains one thing more than the Chinese philosophy of Confucius. That one thing is the Spirit.</p>
<p>When we called on the name of the Lord and were saved, the Spirit entered into us. A higher and more noble Spirit, which is God Himself, was added into our created human spirit. This God has passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion. He died with a sevenfold status, and as such, He accomplished on the cross an all-inclusive death which terminated sin, Satan, the world, the flesh, death, and all the divisive elements that have separated humanity. He removed all the problems in the universe. Then He was resurrected. In resurrection the Spirit was produced, and this Spirit is the highest expression of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR LIVING NEEDING TO BE ACCORDING TO<br />
THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the past the Western missionaries came to China to preach the gospel. They taught people that the heavenly Father loves us, that He sent His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for us, and that we now must believe in Him. This is all that they taught. To the Chinese, this gospel was very shallow. Therefore, it did not gain the respect of the Chinese scholars. They thought the Bible only speaks about going to heaven and hell. They did not know that the Bible reveals the Triune God to man, that this God who created the heavens and the earth also created man, came Himself to be with man through incarnation, lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, accomplished an all-inclusive death on the cross, was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, and today is our Savior. He is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>All the young people should realize that when we believed in the Lord, our repentance was a reaction of our conscience. When we confessed our sins to God and accepted the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, the Spirit of God entered into us. From that time, the Spirit of God has been mingled with the human spirit to become one spirit. Now we should walk according to this spirit. I hope that when you students return to school, you will tell your professor, &ldquo;You are a person of good character. You are one who has developed his bright virtue. But I wish to tell you that although my scholarship cannot be compared with yours, I have one thing that you do not have. I have the Spirit. The Spirit is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>You have to tell your teachers that if they do not have Christ in their human life, it is empty and meaningless. You can sing to them the song &ldquo;The Meaning of Human Life&rdquo;:</p>
<p class="hbody">Human living without Christ<br />
Is but emptiness and vanity;<br />
Void of meaning is this life,<br />
Aimless, hopeless, till one dies.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is life to those who receive,<br />
He regenerates in spirit those who believe;<br />
If you live by Him each day,<br />
He will turn your vanity into song.</p>
<p>We all must go and tell people that what they need is not to develop their bright virtue. What they lack is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. We should walk according to the Spirit. This is to live according to the mingled spirit, that is, the spirit formed by the two spirits being joined as one spirit. If the brothers and sisters would live all day long according to this spirit, everyone would surely enjoy coming to the home meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">SINGING HYMNS IN THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
TO ENLIVEN MAN&rsquo;S SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we walk according to the Spirit, our spirit will be filled with God. This is what Ephesians 5:18-19 refers to: &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; Once we are filled with God in spirit, we will spontaneously sing psalms, hymns, and songs with our heart, speaking to one another and praising the Lord. How many songs did the Chinese scholars of Confucius write? Among all the scholars of Confucius whom you know of, how often do they sing, and how often do they sigh? But we sing every day. Although we do not sing that well, we Christians are those who have songs. We Christians are a singing people.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:18 says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.&rdquo; We should not be drunk with wine, but we should be filled in spirit. If we are to be filled in spirit, we must sing. When we are filled in spirit, what we have within will spontaneously be expressed without. We will begin to sing. I always sing. Every day when I go for a walk, I sing. Singing is one outstanding trait of a Christian. I am the worst in music, but I like to sing more than anything else. I always sing off-key. Sister Lee always tells me to stop singing. But I criticize her also. She has been teaching school all her life. Her mind is very clear, but she would not sing.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that we have so many hymns. For example, this morning I was singing a hymn:</p>
<p class="hbody">Give up the world, Christ to obtain,<br />
 He is your heart&rsquo;s very need.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #1025</p>
<p>I wrote this hymn in 1947. During that year I conducted a conference in Shanghai, and after that conference I spent a day resting in a scenic area. As I was strolling there, I was humming some random melodies to myself. While I was thus musing, verse three of the hymn came to me:</p>
<p class="hbody">Though very great is all the world,<br />
 And very small is your heart,<br />
Yet the great world with all its wealth,<br />
 Never can fill your small heart.</p>
<p>Now I would ask all the brothers and sisters over sixty years old to stand up and sing this verse. Your singing is too proper. There is no need to be so proper. You have to sing like I do. I break all the rules of singing, yet I stir up others&rsquo; spirits. All of you older sisters should go to sing in your home meetings. You have to fire up everyone there. Do not think that only the young people can catch fire. If all the older ones sit still in the meeting, how can we have a good home meeting? But if the older ones would sing, their singing would surely cause the meeting to come alive. On this point I would ask you older ones to learn of me. Do not sing too properly. When you break the rules, sometimes you sing even better. Today I may be the oldest one among all of you. I do not sing well, but I sing with life. Please do not act like an old man or woman. You must be bold to sing.</p>
<p>Previously, when I went to a home meeting and saw that six out of eight were older ones, I would ask myself, &ldquo;How are we going to meet?&rdquo; But just now I saw some older ones singing with boldness. Of course, I do not mean that we should sing in a disorderly way. What I mean is that we should sing to enliven others. Now our concept is changed. I believe if the older brothers and sisters would go to the home meeting and sing, the whole meeting will come alive. Besides these older saints, we still have a group of brothers and sisters between the ages of forty and sixty. All of them must go and sing in the home meetings. In addition, we have an army of young ones from twenty to thirty-nine years old. All of them must not take a leave of absence from the home meetings. They must function properly in these meetings. But this is not all. There is a commando unit in the church, composed of those from age one to nineteen. If these four groups of people would sing in the home meetings, the meetings will surely be enlivened.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SING AND TO READ THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>Whenever I sing, I come alive. While I take a walk, I sing one hymn after another:</p>
<p class="hbody">Evil ways you are treading,<br />
Traps there are before you,<br />
If you turn not, awaiting ahead<br />
Is the pit of perdition.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn">Chinese <em>Hymns,</em> #715</p>
<p>Sometimes I sing:</p>
<p class="hbody">Hark! the herald angels sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Glory to the new-born King;<br />
Peace on earth, and mercy mild;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God and sinners reconciled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #84</p>
<p>At other times I sing:</p>
<p class="hbody">O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,<br />
Though all things around us be trying,<br />
Though floods of affliction....</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #717</p>
<p>Then I may sing:</p>
<p class="hbody">What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Jesus came into my heart!...</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #309</p>
<p>Sometimes I sing:</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ the Savior is just the One you need,<br />
He&rsquo;s God incarnate, as a man indeed;<br />
In His body....</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #1024</p>
<p>There are so many hymns for us to sing.</p>
<p>If an old person such as me can sing this way, you can do even better. Sing in your daily life. Even the more, sing in the meetings. This kind of singing is surely scriptural; it comes from a walk that is according to the Spirit. Even the more, it is an overflow of being filled with God in spirit. Now let me ask you a question: If I were to say, &ldquo;I am about to get angry,&rdquo; what hymn do you think I should sing? I would take the tune of &ldquo;You Need Jesus&rdquo; and sing it with the words, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, don&rsquo;t be angry.&rdquo; If a couple is arguing, and their child would sing to them this song, the couple would feel very shameful for arguing.</p>
<p>The reasons the home meetings are not living are first a lack of speaking, and second a lack of singing. We all must learn to sing hymns. We should not only read the Bible; we must also read the hymns. I like very much the song:</p>
<p class="hbody">All the way to Calvary He went for me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went for me, He went for me;<br />
All the way to Calvary He went for me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died to set me free.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #994</p>
<p>Then, there is hymn 986:</p>
<p class="hbody">What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Savior;<br />
What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Lord!</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #986</p>
<p>There is also hymn 322:</p>
<p class="hbody">Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,<br />
Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;<br />
Finding joy and pleasure in abounding measure,<br />
I am drinking at the Fountain of life.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #322</p>
<p>When I sing in this way, all my worries are gone and all the sicknesses are removed. Praise the Lord for giving us so many good hymns.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, why would you not sing? We all have to repent for not singing and praising. We all want the meetings to be living. Why then do we wait? Why do we not sing some hymns?</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING TO BRING IN A REVIVAL</h2>
<p>If a brother reads the Bible daily, sings constantly with joy, prays without ceasing, does not quench the Spirit, and does not despise the word of prophecy, do you think he will skip the home meetings? Will he sit at home when it is time for the home meeting? I told you yesterday that I understand that you are all very busy. But we are only asking you to attend three important meetings in a week: the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning truth meeting, the evening table meeting, and one home meeting. You cannot excuse yourself from any of these three meetings.</p>
<p>I would ask all the brothers and sisters to pick up the burden to pray for the evangelization of Taiwan. This will be accomplished through the home meetings and through the producing of the full-timers. The full-timers will be sent to many different places. We must pray for this. Our prayer should be the track for the train to run on. May the Lord remember this move, and may all the saints pick up this burden faithfully for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. If we produce five hundred full-timers each year, the expense will be very great. But without the full-timers we cannot do anything. The move and living of the full-timers must be supported by the church. Prayer plus the faithful supply is the only way we can possibly evangelize Taiwan. Otherwise, even if we have the heart, we will not be able to do it.</p>
<p>Concerning the meeting hall in Lin-Ko, we have not yet done anything outwardly, but much has been planned. The brothers who are mainly responsible for the design are in the United States. It is not a small thing to build a large meeting hall on thirty-seven and a half acres. The main work will be the building itself. We intend to build it ourselves. Some brothers will come from the United States to help. Also, some help will be raised up locally. This will be more economical and practical. I estimate that after we obtain the permits from the government, we will start the construction work immediately, and the project will be completed by 1988. I hope that you brothers and sisters will match this move with your prayers.</p>
<p>If you are led by the Lord to offer materially, I suggest that you not hold back your desire to offer. Do not wait until the last minute to offer a large amount of money. The best way is to give weekly or monthly.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord that He has given us such a fellowship this evening. I have presented to you almost everything concerning the Lord&rsquo;s move in the church. I believe we all will be faithful in practicing the home meetings. As I said in the previous message, &ldquo;Heaven may pass away, and the earth may be annulled, but the home meetings must never be forsaken.&rdquo; I believe also that we will all practice one-on-one, making home deliveries, and giving injections at home. At the same time I trust that you will remember the move to produce the full-timers and that you will pray for their needs and training. I trust that you will cooperate with the Lord in love. The more the home meetings develop, the more urgent the need will be for the large meeting hall. If we all realize the present situation, we will put forth our effort and we will pick up the burden for prayer. The Lord will add to us everything we need for the spread of His work here in Taiwan.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXERCISING TO SPEAK THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:16-17; 2 Cor. 3:16-18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO SING AT HOME</h2>
<p>The hymn we just sang, hymn 987, was written at the beginning of this century. It was written by an American brother. At that time, the liberal theology was flourishing, which said that the Bible is not the word of God, that miracles are not real, and that the resurrection of Jesus was merely a resurrection of His ideas. It also said that there are neither angels nor demons.</p>
<p>The American brother who wrote this hymn was L. Wilbur Chapman. In this hymn, he said:</p>
<p class="hbody">One day when sin was as black as could be,<br />
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin....</p>
<p class="hbody">Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buried, He carried my sins far away;<br />
Rising, He justified freely forever:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day He&rsquo;s coming&mdash;O glorious day!</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #987</p>
<p>This hymn has five verses. The first verse speaks of Jesus&rsquo; incarnation. The second tells of His crucifixion. The third verse speaks of His burial, the fourth, of His resurrection, and the fifth, of His second coming. The last phrase of the fifth verse says, &ldquo;This Jesus is mine!&rdquo; What the author was saying at the end was &ldquo;This is <em>my</em> Jesus! My Jesus is not the Jesus that you modernists claim to know. My Jesus was incarnated because He loved me. He was crucified to save me and buried to take my sins far away. He rose to justify me freely forever, and one day He is coming back to receive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us also sing another hymn, hymn 680. Both the verses and the chorus are very well written. This hymn is suitable for both the young and old. But to sing this song you need to become young again; otherwise, you will not sense the flavor of the words, &ldquo;Oh love, wonderful love!&rdquo; When you come to the chorus of the second verse, you should sing it softly:</p>
<p class="hbody">He suffered crucifixion, what mercy to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mercy to me, mercy to me;<br />
He suffered crucifixion, what mercy to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died to set me free.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn">Chinese <em>Hymns,</em> #680</p>
<p>I hope you brothers and sisters would all pick up the burden that from now on, whenever you have some free time at home, you would sing these hymns until you know them well.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO ENJOY GOD BEING TO WORSHIP GOD</h2>
<p>Now we still need to see the key point of the home meetings. The crucial point of the home meetings is to exercise to speak. We must be freed from our dumbness by exercising to speak. We know that if a person is healthy, he will have a good appetite. This is according to the biological need of the human life. As far as our spiritual need is concerned, if a Christian is in a normal condition, he will have an appetite for the meetings. Do not think that our coming to meetings is for a worship service. We must realize that our coming to the meetings is for eating.</p>
<p>In John chapter four, when the Lord Jesus left Judea to go to Samaria, He did not go by the usual route. He purposely took a route which led directly to Samaria. After He arrived there, He sat by Jacob&rsquo;s well. Our Lord is omniscient. He sat there because He had a special purpose; He was waiting for a sinner predestinated by God. The Samaritan woman did come, and the Lord Jesus asked her for a drink. In this way the door for speaking was opened.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is an expert in opening doors for conversation. We all must learn this one thing. While the Lord Jesus was talking to the Samaritan woman, He showed her need to her. Immediately she asked the Lord for the living water. The Lord then told her, &ldquo;God is Spirit. He is the living water. You have to drink of Him, enjoy Him, and receive Him. Only this is true worship.&rdquo; All of you young people who have studied away from home do know that when you come home for vacation, the one thing that your mothers love most to do is to sit you down and feed you the food they have prepared for you. The more you eat, the happier they become.</p>
<p>I have also experienced this. Whenever I would come home from a trip, my mother would prepare for me dumplings, which she knew I enjoyed. As soon as I arrived home, she would sit me down and serve me with the food she had cooked. Sometimes she would even stand right beside me. I was embarrassed by her service. I would ask her to sit down. But she would not feel happy sitting down. Who is the Lord Jesus? He is God. When He came, He was ministering the living water to the thirsty ones. But the thirsty ones did not recognize Him, nor did they understand what true worship is all about. The filthy Samaritan woman acted in a very religious way. She began to discuss with the Lord Jesus the matter of worship: &ldquo;Our ancestors said that we should worship on this mountain. But you Jews say that worship should be on that mountain.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You are wrong. It is neither this mountain nor that mountain. It is something in your spirit. I have the living water. In other words, I am the living water. I am the God whom you worship. I am presenting Myself to you. Just take a drink! If you drink, you are worshipping Me. If you enjoy Me, I will be satisfied.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">OUR MEETING BEING AN ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>We all need to have a proper concept of the meetings. We do not come to the meeting to &ldquo;worship&rdquo;; we come to the meeting to enjoy. When we enjoy God together, God is satisfied. When we read the Old Testament, in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy we do see numerous instances where God told the Israelites that their center of worship was to be Mount Zion in Jerusalem. They could not set up another center in another place. However, we cannot find a verse that tells the Israelites how they should worship or bow themselves before God. The Bible does not give us a record of how one should worship God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PRESENCE IN THE MEETINGS FAR EXCEEDING<br />
HIS PRESENCE WITH INDIVIDUALS</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly tells us that when the people went up three times a year to worship God, they could not go empty-handed. They must bring a great amount of rich food to satisfy God. When God was fed, He fed them in return. The worship of the children of Israel was a kind of eating. We see this type in the Old Testament. Unfortunately, because of man&rsquo;s deep religious concept, when he comes to the Bible, he does not see any of these things.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we need to change our concept. Our real worship to God is our enjoyment of Him. This is like your coming home from a journey. Your mother hurries to cook for you. If you are home for a week, she will feed you the best food every day. She is so eager to see you eat. This is God&rsquo;s concept. When we were in mainland China we did not use the term &ldquo;eating God.&rdquo; It was not until 1958 that I spoke in a conference concerning the way to enjoy God by eating and drinking. Since then the term &ldquo;enjoying God&rdquo; became popular among us.</p>
<p>When we come to the meetings, if we do not enjoy God, but are instead keeping a kind of religious formality, our meetings will become a kind of suffering. I attended a church school when I was young. If we did not attend the chapel hour, we would have points taken off from our record. However, to sit and listen to the sermon was surely boring. If the meeting went on half a minute past the scheduled time, and if the preacher was still speaking, all the students would shuffle their feet on the wooden floor. This was a sign to the speaker that time was up and that he ought to stop. As soon as the preacher would leave the room, everybody was happy and ran out to play. I describe this to you to show you that our meetings should not be like that kind of worship service. Our meetings are to enjoy God. The Lord Jesus said that whenever two or three are gathered into His name, He is with them. Perhaps you would say, &ldquo;Is not the Lord with us individually all the time?&rdquo; That is right. But we can all testify that the Lord&rsquo;s presence with us individually cannot compare with His presence with us corporately in the meetings.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENCE WITH INDIVIDUALS<br />
NEVER REPLACING HIS PRESENCE IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>I said yesterday that if you come to the home meetings, it proves that you love the Lord. Since you love the Lord, surely you would fellowship with Him and spend time with Him. When the Lord enlightens you, you would confess your sins and would ask the Lord to cleanse you with His blood. This brings you into a deeper fellowship with the Lord. Naturally, when you come to the home meeting in this way, you will bring this fellowship into the meeting. This shows that our personal spiritual condition has very much to do with the home meetings. This is not all. Our living must be one of walking according to the Spirit. If we are filled with God every day, we will surely go to the home meetings. Tonight we want to go deeper into this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BOW OUR KNEES TO THE FATHER<br />
THAT CHRIST MAY MAKE HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:16-17 says, &ldquo;That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo; This verse says that we must let Christ make His home in our hearts through faith. Merely to allow the Lord to live in us is not enough; we must let the Lord make home in our hearts. This is not a light thing. If it were a light thing, Paul would not need to pray for us. For this cause, Paul bowed his knees unto the Father, beseeching the Father according to the riches of His glory. The riches of God&rsquo;s glory are the manifestation of everything God is. According to these riches, God is strengthening us with power into the inner man through His Spirit.</p>
<p>We all have this kind of experience: During morning watch we pray-read, praise, and pray. Our whole being is turned from the outward man to the inward man. But after morning watch we may meet a classmate. After talking to him for a few minutes, our whole being is distracted from the inward back to the outward. To turn us from the outward to the inward, there is the need for prayer, for the Father of glory to strengthen us according to His riches through His Spirit and with His power into our inner man. This is not easy. But for us to be distracted from the inward to the outward is too easy. It is like rolling a stone down the hill; it is downhill all the way. A few words from our classmate will easily lead us out of our spirit. But for us to turn back to the spirit is like climbing uphill; we need the Father to strengthen us according to the riches of His glory through His Spirit and with power into the inner man. When that happens there will be a result: Christ will make home in our hearts.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;that&rdquo; in verse 17 means that God&rsquo;s strengthening us into our inner man with power according to the riches of His glory through His Spirit is for a purpose. The cause is your being brought into your inner man; the result is that Christ makes His home in you. If you have not thoroughly prayed before the Lord for three weeks, even though you may have been busy attending meetings, pursuing the truth, working on the campus, and doing all kinds of spiritual works, you will not sense that Christ is making His home in you.</p>
<p>I hope that all of you, including the newly saved ones, would at least once a week put everything down, leave all your busy environment behind, and calmly quiet yourself before the Lord to have a thorough time of prayer. This is very precious. This will make you feel that your whole being is in the inner man. You will have a deep sense that the Lord Jesus is very much at home within you. Whatever room He wants to enter within you, there will be a place for Him. He will be able to go in and out freely in any part of your being. This is to have the Lord making home in our heart.</p><h2 class="head1">BEHOLDING THE LORD WITH UNVEILED FACE<br />
STIRRING UP OUR DESIRE FOR THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Whenever I pray thoroughly before the Lord, I experience the Lord operating freely within me. At those times my greatest hope is that the meeting time would come quickly; I have a strong appetite for the meeting. When my relationship with the Lord is not right within, the Lord cannot make home in my heart. Naturally, I will not have that strong a desire for the meeting.</p>
<p>After Paul prayed, there were five results. First, we have Christ making His home in us. Second, we are rooted and grounded in love. Third, we can apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth. Fourth, we can know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ. And fifth, we are filled unto all the fullness of God. As long as we let Christ make His home in our hearts, we will certainly desire the meetings. We will definitely attend every meeting, be it big or small. We will long to share with all the brothers and sisters the Lord whom we enjoy.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 3:16-17 says, &ldquo;But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; When the Israelites read the Old Testament, there was a veil covering them, because their hearts were turned away from the Lord. But when their hearts turned to the Lord, the veil was taken away. Today the Lord is the Spirit, and this Spirit is within us. When we have the Spirit of the Lord within us, there is freedom. We will be liberated, and all bondage will be gone.</p>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; When we all behold the Lord with unveiled face, that is, when we behold Him face to face, we reflect the Lord and are transformed into His glorious image, from glory to glory. Then we will definitely have a desire to come to the meetings. And when we come to the meetings, we will sing hymns of rejoicing all the way.</p>
<p>If we allow the Lord to make His home in our hearts, and are willing to have our veils taken away, we will have an unveiled face to behold Him and will be transformed into His image. In this way we will go to the meetings with joy. I hope that you would all learn a few more hymns. The more hymns there are within you, the easier it is for the Holy Spirit to lead you to sing. For example, let us sing hymn 717:</p>
<p class="hbody">O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,<br />
Tho&rsquo; all things around us be trying,<br />
Tho&rsquo; floods of affliction like sea billows roar,<br />
It&rsquo;s better to sing than be sighing.</p>
<p class="hbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to sing than be sighing:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to live than be dying;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us rejoice evermore.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #717</p>
<p>As we enjoy this hymn, it is as refreshing as eating ice cream, especially for the older brothers and sisters when they come to verse 3:</p>
<p class="hbody">O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,<br />
When sickness upon us is stealing,<br />
No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,<br />
For joy is the fountain of healing.</p>
<p>As you fellowship with the Lord this way, you may say to the Lord, &ldquo;No cordial like gladness my strength can restore, for joy is the fountain of healing.&rdquo; Then you will surely have a desire&mdash;&ldquo;I will go to the meeting.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">BRINGING THE SPIRITUAL ATMOSPHERE<br />
TO THE MEETING</h2>
<p>Another good hymn is number 720:</p>
<p class="hbody">God hath not promised skies always blue,<br />
Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through;<br />
God hath not promised sun without rain,<br />
Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.</p>
<p class="hbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But God hath promised strength for the day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest for the labor, light for the way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace for the trials, help from above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfailing sympathy, undying love.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #720</p>
<p>Sing this hymn over and over again. Do not sing too loudly or too strongly, but sing softly. Then there is hymn 679:</p>
<p class="hbody">Safe in the arms of Jesus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe on His gentle breast,<br />
There by His love o&rsquo;ershaded,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetly my soul doth rest.<br />
Hark! &rsquo;tis a song of heaven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borne in the sweetest voice,<br />
Echoed by saints in spirit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making my heart rejoice.</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #679</p>
<p>Do not consider this as a hymn used during a funeral. Do not wait until you die to enjoy the arms of Jesus when you can enjoy them today.</p>
<p>The hymns we sing in the home meetings need not be fully in line with the fellowship in the meeting. Do not be legal. The hymns we select depend fully on whether we have the Spirit or not. If in your daily life you let the Lord make home in you, and if you are being transformed into His image by beholding His glory with unveiled face, then He will lead you. You will sense the nourishing and comforting within. The Lord may give you a hymn. Then you come to the meeting. You may be the first one in the meeting, but you do not need to wait for others. You just begin to sing, &ldquo;Safe in the arms of Jesus....&rdquo; As you sing, you bring the spiritual atmosphere into the meeting. Those who come later will join the singing and the meeting will begin spontaneously.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN THE LORD IN OUR DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, you need to see that the key to the home meetings is that we live in the Lord in our daily life. We let the Lord make home in us, allowing Him the ground within us, and we are always before the Lord beholding Him. As the Lord gives you various feelings, you begin to sing different hymns. Then no matter which hymn you sing, you are always in the Spirit, and you will bring the spiritual atmosphere to the meeting. Please remember that we go to the meetings, especially the home meetings, not to attend a religious ceremony nor to hear some messages. We go to enjoy the Lord and to bring the Lord whom we have enjoyed to the meeting.</p>
<p>When we come to the meeting, I bring the Lord I have enjoyed, you bring the Lord you have enjoyed, he brings the Lord he has enjoyed. Is this not like the ancient Israelites coming to feast before God? They brought the top portion of their yearly harvest to offer to God, and God invited them to enjoy it together with Him. How sweet this is! We and He, God and man, enjoy together. This is the proper principle of the meeting of the believers. Therefore, we must have the home meetings. Without the home meetings it is difficult to attain to such a situation. It is only in the home meetings that what is within everyone can be easily developed.</p>
<p>I really love the home meetings, because in the big meetings structure cannot be avoided, but in the home meetings the atmosphere is very free. In our daily life we labor on the Lord, and when we come to the meeting each one brings something. This kind of meeting is a meeting in which we enjoy God and God enjoys us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<p>When you preach the gospel to your relative or classmate, do not argue with him. You may sing a hymn to him. Everyone loves music. Although he may refuse to believe in Jesus, his heart is not made of iron or stone but of flesh. The hymn we just sang says:</p>
<p class="hbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you I am praying, for you I am praying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you I am praying, I&rsquo;m praying for you.</p>
<p>When you sing like this, his heart will be softened.</p>
<p>In order to do anything we need the skill and the technique. When you preach the gospel, do not argue with people. Do not be inflexible. If they will not believe, do not insist that they believe or tell them that if they do not believe, they will go to hell. If you do this, they will say, &ldquo;I would rather go to hell!&rdquo; This is useless. You must change your way. If they reject the gospel, you should not say anything to further provoke them. Instead, you may say, &ldquo;Let me sing a hymn to you.&rdquo; Then begin to sing to them. If you keep singing, they will be moved. Let us sing another hymn:</p>
<p class="hbody">You are fallen in sin; you are suffering in pain.<br />
Why don&rsquo;t you repent right now, and be free from sin?<br />
You&rsquo;re walking in evil, there are traps everywhere.<br />
You will surely fall if you do not turn!<br />
Jesus wants to save you, He is waiting to heal you.<br />
Why not open your heart today and receive Him?</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn">Chinese <em>Hymns,</em> #715</p>
<p>I like this hymn very much. I call this &ldquo;The Hymn of a Sinner&rsquo;s History&rdquo; because it persuades people to believe in the Lord on the one hand, and it tells the history of the sinner on the other hand. Verse three says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Dying years, increasing yet decreasing,<br />
Life is but a cloud.<br />
Who knows if it will not vanish tomorrow?</p>
<p>All mothers like to see their children celebrating their first birthday. But when a person grows old, he does not enjoy his birthday anymore. If I have ninety dollars in my pocket, and I have spent eighty-one dollars already, I must be careful; I have only nine dollars left. Apparently, our years are increasing; actually, they are decreasing. As your age increases by a year, your life decreases by a year. Our age is like a bank deposit. Our savings are limited, but our spending is continuous. With money there is still the possibility of control, but you have no way to control your age. For this reason, man is somewhat disappointed with his life.</p>
<p>When you come to verse three, you can start preaching the gospel: &ldquo;O friends, you are living in sin. You are in the hand of the devil. Your end is just death. Time is passing by, day by day. All men, rich or poor, noble or humble, are going down the same way. No one can escape. But when the Lord Jesus came, He &lsquo;died to bruise the devil, and bore our sins.&rsquo; A person without the Savior is like a man under the hand of a surgeon on the operating table; he is being cut at the surgeon&rsquo;s will. But the Lord came, and He nullified death and manifested life.&rdquo; You should tell your friends that although they have grieved the Lord, He is still ready to save. Although they have rejected Him, He is still waiting for them.</p>
<p>You should sing gospel songs to your relatives and friends. You should also help them to sing along with you. Sometimes it is better to sing than to preach. Let us sing together hymn 1065:</p>
<p class="hbody">O how great His salvation! O how great His salvation!<br />
O how great His salvation! Jesus saves me now!</p>
<p class="hbody">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus breaks ev&rsquo;ry fetter! Jesus breaks ev&rsquo;ry fetter!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus breaks ev&rsquo;ry fetter! Jesus sets me free!</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #1065</p>
<p>Parents like to hear their children sing. When you visit your relatives, you may first give their children some candy and then teach them to sing a simple hymn. Their parents may be unhappy if you persuade them to believe in Jesus. But they will pay much attention to their children&rsquo;s singing. When they hear the songs, they will be touched.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING OUR LAMBS TO THE HOME MEETINGS<br />
AND FEEDING THEM THERE</h2>
<p>Let us go on to see a key to the home meetings. Today we want to bring out one key to the home meetings, that is, to bring others to our meetings. If we desire to see our home meetings prosper, everyone must bring others to the meetings. If you would do this, and he would do this, soon the number in the home meetings would increase. This principle is very scriptural. Consider the Shulammite in the Song of Songs. She was only thinking of herself. Her word to the Lord was, &ldquo;Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock? / Where do you make it lie down at noon?&rdquo; (1:7). The Lord replied, &ldquo;If you yourself do not know, / You fairest among women, / Go forth on the footsteps of the flock, / And pasture your young goats / By the shepherds&rsquo; tents&rdquo; (1:8). This seeker of the Lord told the Lord that she was tired of seeking. She did not have peace; she needed rest. The Lord told her, &ldquo;You may follow the footsteps of the flock. As long as you take the way of the flock, you will find Me. But do not forget that there are still the kids. You must bring your kids along as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where are the &ldquo;shepherds&rsquo; tents&rdquo; today? They are in the church. And where is the church? It is in the home meetings! Therefore, we all must bring our young, new, and unbelieving &ldquo;kids&rdquo; to the &ldquo;shepherds&rsquo; tents.&rdquo; Do not think that it is only in the world that we have children. As seekers of the Lord, we should also have children. We should have apprentices following us. I have seen many precious brothers and sisters in both the West and the East who are very dear. Yet they have a big problem: they do not have any offspring. Neither do they have any apprentices.</p>
<p>All believers must be like parents, bringing forth children. They must also be like masters taking on apprentices. Everyone must learn to bring in people. We learn many lessons when we bring in people. All parents can learn many lessons from their children. Up to now I have been a parent for three generations. I have not only grandchildren but also great-grandchildren. I am a father, a grandfather, and a great-grandfather. I have learned the most. What teachers teach us is theoretical, but what our children teach us is practical.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MORE FRUIT AND MORE ENJOYMENT OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>John 15:2 says, &ldquo;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.&rdquo; Every branch in Jesus must bear fruit. Perhaps some may say, &ldquo;The fruit-bearing in chapter fifteen does not necessarily refer to people. In Galatians chapter five, the fruit of the Spirit refers to love, joy, peace, longsuffering, and so forth.&rdquo; If you read the context of John chapter fifteen you will see that the emphasis there is on people as fruit. If a branch has only one fruit it is unattractive. But if a branch has no fruit at all, the Lord said that He will take it away. To be taken away means to be deprived of the enjoyment of the riches of the tree.</p>
<p>The fruitless ones are in danger of losing their enjoyment. As a branch, if you want to enjoy the riches of the tree, you must bear much fruit. The more fruit you bear, the more riches you will receive from the Lord. That means the more fruit you bear, the more enjoyment you have. You must go and bear fruit. You must bring in people. In this matter there are too many lessons to learn. I have mentioned this in the past. You must deal with different kinds of people in different ways. To teach gospel songs to your relatives&rsquo; children is one way. To sing to your grandfather is another. Of course, you must pray for them. There are many ways. The question is whether or not you have the heart to take care of them.</p>
 <p>We who are saved and are the Lord&rsquo;s are destined to bear fruit. Whether or not you have the desire, you must bear fruit. If you do not bear fruit, you are doing something other than the Lord&rsquo;s destiny for you, and you will lose the enjoyment of the Lord. Chapter one of the Song of Songs says that we, the seekers of the Lord, must not give up our &ldquo;kids.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S PROMISE BEING FOR ME AND<br />
MY HOUSEHOLD TO BE SAVED</h2>
<p>John chapter one shows us that after Andrew met the Lord, immediately he found his own brother and said to him, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah&rdquo; (v. 41). He then led him to see Jesus. When Philip met the Lord, he went and found Nathanael, and said to him, &ldquo;We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and prophets, wrote&rdquo; (v. 45). Nathanael had more knowledge than Philip did. He said, &ldquo;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&rdquo; (v. 46). He was right, for the Old Testament clearly records that Christ would come out of the city of David. After such a word, even Philip became confused. He did not know what to say. Then he came up with a solution: &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo; This is a good way. He took Nathanael to see Jesus. Here we see two pairs: Andrew bringing Peter to the Lord, and Philip bringing Nathanael to Jesus. The two of them each brought one sheep with them.</p>
<p>In Acts chapter ten, Cornelius sent for Peter. Before Peter arrived, Cornelius had called together his relatives and intimate friends, and they were waiting for Peter. This is a pattern for us to follow. When a home meeting is held in your house, the first people you should invite are your relatives and intimate friends. Fill the house with them.</p>
<p>In Acts 16:31, Paul told the jailer, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; In this verse we do not see any word concerning bringing a sheep. However, as soon as one believes in the Lord, he will immediately think of his household: his parents, wife, children, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and cousins. All these are one&rsquo;s &ldquo;household.&rdquo; The scope of this household is extremely broad. Strictly speaking, this whole household is your &ldquo;kids.&rdquo; You must take them along.</p>
<p>The United States immigration law provides that entrance to the United States is based upon two principles: humanitarian considerations and family reunion. It is this principle of family reunion that has caused trouble for the United States. For example, perhaps I may enter the United States first. But I have parents, brothers, and sisters with me. They are my direct relatives. Of course, I have my wife and children as well. When they all enter the United States, my sister-in-law has her parents and, of course, brothers and sisters too. With such connections, the Chinese are all over the United States, and are giving the Americans a big headache. My point is that a big number may give the United States a big headache, but it will never give the heavenly kingdom any headache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.&rdquo; You may extend the scope of the word <em>household</em> as widely as you like. I have seven families connected to me by marriage. And these seven families have more families connected to them by marriage. All these are our close relatives. We cannot see them die. We must bring them to salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE ACCOMMODATING<br />
IN LEADING OTHERS TO SALVATION</h2>
<p>Now you will probably tell me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I have believed in the Lord for five years, but my wife absolutely refuses to believe.&rdquo; I have heard this kind of word. My answer to that is, &ldquo;Go home, and do not talk to her about Jesus any more; neither pray in her presence. She is tired of hearing about Jesus. You must find out what your wife wants from you. If she is upset about your coming home late at night, you have to learn the lesson. You should sacrifice the meeting a little to get home earlier.&rdquo; Perhaps you would say, &ldquo;Do you mean you want me to go home before the meeting is over?&rdquo; That is right. You either sacrifice the meeting, or you sacrifice your wife. You have to choose between the two. To save your wife you must sacrifice the meeting. If you do this, after two months your wife&rsquo;s opposition to Jesus will gradually go away.</p>
 <p>I know that some sisters really love the Lord. However, their dispositions are too strong. Since the day they were married, their husbands have been under their control. When they were saved, their husbands were hoping that their temper would change. Eventually their temper did improve a little. But their dispositions remained quite strong. They forced their husbands to go their way. They would even force their husbands to believe in Jesus. The husbands would think that this Jesus is too terrible. Before their wives were saved, they were not as forceful. But now they are forcing them even to go to meetings. The more they do that, the more the husbands will just refuse to go. Sisters, I advise you to let go. Do not pressure your husbands anymore to believe in the Lord. You have to learn the lessons. You must learn to accommodate them. When you are fully changed, they will easily believe.</p>
<p>I know that many parents learn much in leading their children to believe in the Lord. Some parents have strong personalities. Their children have been taught to be obedient since their youth. But in their hearts they do not necessarily like their parents&rsquo; personalities. When they are forced to believe in the Lord one day, they will refuse. Brother Nee&rsquo;s salvation had much to do with his mother&rsquo;s change. His mother was a shrewd wife at home. She never admitted mistakes to her husband and children. But one day she was saved. When she went home, the first thing she did was to admit her mistakes in tears to Brother Nee. Such a change in the shrewd mother&rsquo;s personality moved the son. Because of that, he went to hear the gospel. When he heard it, he was saved.</p>
<p>Some parents are thoughtless and attend few meetings after they are saved, but their children are very spiritual. This shows us a general tendency: those of us who greatly love the Lord easily alienate our children by our zeal. Some mothers love the Lord very much. They rank first in attending meetings. But they have no way to bring their children to the Lord. The reason for this is that they are too strong. The same principle applies to all of us. We must bring people in, not by our zeal but by our gentleness. Everyone who wants to bring in others should learn to be as yielding as paste. The main characteristic of paste is that it is very accommodating. You can spread paste on anything, be it a flat surface, a sharp corner, or a crooked edge.</p><h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL BEGINNING WITH<br />
RELATIVES AND INTIMATE FRIENDS</h2>
<p>Every lover of the Lord must be like paste; he must be able to be spread anywhere. Whoever touches us should get stuck to us. The lovers of the Lord cannot be like steel plates; they cannot have a hard and unyielding personality. If so, they will not bear fruit even if they love the Lord until they die. Every brother and sister who is like paste is able to catch men. Everyone whose personality is like steel can scarcely lead others to Christ. The Lord&rsquo;s word is clear: believe in the Lord, and your household shall be saved. I have been observing this for sixty years. It is difficult to find one who was saved without his household eventually being saved also.</p>
<p>Many did bring their whole household to the Lord, but not without many frustrations. For example, some husbands do not like their wife&rsquo;s personality; they think their wives are too strong. But they can tell that before their wives were saved, there was one kind of hardness. After they were saved, there was another kind of hardness. Before they were saved, they were stubborn senselessly; their hardness would come and go with their temper. After they are saved, they are hard for a specific purpose: they want to bring their husbands to the Lord. But in nine out of ten cases, these husbands will not call on the Lord until they are about to die. When they call on the Lord, the wives would cry, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; They would say with tears that the Lord has heard their prayers. I have seen too many cases like this. Children of those who love the Lord may refuse the gospel at first; they may strongly oppose their parents. But eventually they also believe, and they regret that they hurt their parents and did not turn to the Lord sooner.</p>
<p>Today, we hope that the number in the church will increase. The only way this can happen is by the brothers and sisters all bringing in new ones. Who can say today that all his relatives are saved? There are still many relatives and intimate friends whom we must try our best to bring in. Acts 1:8 says, &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; Our unsaved relatives and intimate friends are our &ldquo;Jerusalem.&rdquo; We must receive power from the Lord to begin preaching from Jerusalem, that is, from our relatives and close friends. We must labor on them.</p>
<p>There are fifty-two weeks in a year. It is impossible for us not to be able to lead one relative to the Lord within these fifty-two weeks, 365 days. If our relatives and friends are not saved, it is because we do not preach. If we preach and they are not saved, it is because we preach in the wrong way. It all depends on how we do it. We need to learn. Look at chapter four of the Gospel of John. As soon as the Samaritan woman was saved, she left her waterpot and went away into the city and testified to the men. Because of this woman&rsquo;s testimony, many Samaritans in that city believed in Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE RESPONSIBILITY<br />
OF RESTORING THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS</h2>
<p>In Acts 11, when Barnabas arrived in Antioch and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain with the Lord with purpose of heart. A considerable number was added to the Lord. He then went away to Tarsus to seek out Saul. When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they were gathered in the church and taught a considerable number of people. I do not believe that when Barnabas found Saul, he imagined that this Saul would one day become the foremost apostle to the Gentiles. If Barnabas had not gone to Tarsus to seek for Saul, I doubt whether there would ever have been an apostle Paul. Let us simply go ahead and bring in people. Who knows whether those we bring in will one day have a bright and hopeful future?</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:14 says, &ldquo;We...admonish the disorderly, console the fainthearted, sustain the weak.&rdquo; This tells us that we must bring in people. We must be accommodating towards the disorderly and must identify ourselves with the fainthearted and the weak. None of them can be rejected carelessly.</p>
<p>James 5:19-20 says, &ldquo;If any one among you is led astray from the truth and someone turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that one&rsquo;s soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.&rdquo; Among the brothers and sisters, there are unavoidably those who sin and are led astray from the truth. It is our responsibility to restore them. All these items are included in the subject of bringing in people. These are all key points on the home meetings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYING, READING, SINGING, AND<br />
SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 3:15-16, 2, 9; 2 Tim. 2:2, 15; Rev. 1:2, 9</h1>
<p>First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the pillar and base of the truth. At Paul&rsquo;s time, the buildings around the Mediterranean Sea were supported by pillars, and underneath the pillars there was a base. The pillars were built upon the base, and the whole building was supported by the pillars. Paul said that the church is the pillar. Upon her is the truth of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING, READING, SINGING, AND SPEAKING<br />
THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:16 says that great is the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh. God was not only manifested in the flesh at the time the Lord Jesus lived on the earth. That was only the beginning. The manifestation of God in the flesh continues today in the church. Hence, there are two things here that are related to one another. On the one hand, the church upholds the truth of God. This truth is the unveiling of the hidden God. He was manifested in the flesh. This is a great mystery. On the other hand, when the church comes together, what we speak, sing, and preach are words of this great mystery. In another sense, this is also God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>Whenever we come together, we should speak, read, sing, and pray the truth. This is the key to the home meeting. It is to pray-read-sing-speak the word of the Bible. In the home meeting, when we say that we want everyone to speak, we mean that everyone should speak God&rsquo;s word. We cannot speak about everything and anything. The home meeting is not for chatting. It is for the speaking of the truth.</p>
<p>When Paul spoke this word, the church was already in confusion. There were already people in their meetings talking about the genealogies in the Old Testament. You must realize that there is no end to talk about genealogies. There were also those who talked about the Ten Commandments of Moses. It may seem as if all this is most proper and right. But none of this is the great mystery of godliness. None of this is God manifested in the flesh. For this reason Paul said to Timothy, &ldquo;I exhorted you...to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God&rsquo;s economy, which is in faith&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:3-4). Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus just to do one thing: to charge others not to teach anything other than the mystery of godliness.</p>
<p>Even to the children we should not speak too many stories. If we do, we will stray off. Some may say that this kind of speaking is too deep for children. I do not think that is necessarily so. Speak to adults concerning the mystery of godliness. Speak to the young people concerning the same. Even to the children you should speak this also. This is the truth. The church is here to uphold the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING IN THE WORD TO PERFECT OURSELVES<br />
AND TO TEACH OTHERS</h2>
<p>When I went to the United States twenty-three years ago, I was already over sixty years old. Many thought that my messages to the Americans were surely influenced by Eastern culture. When they heard me teaching others to call on the name of the Lord, they thought that was the Eastern chanting. They also accused me of preaching pantheism, of telling people that the door is Christ, that the window is Christ, and that even the air and the food are Christ. But my speaking was based on Colossians 2:16-17: &ldquo;...in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.&rdquo; They can accuse no one but their own ignorance of the Bible. Their understanding is fragmentary; they have not studied thoroughly but rather have listened carelessly.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. Two thousand years ago in Paul&rsquo;s time, the church was just as confused. For this reason Paul urged Timothy to hold this principle: when elders were set up in the church, there was to be this one basic qualification, that they be &ldquo;apt to teach&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:2). The elders must be apt to teach the truth, and this truth is nothing other than God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>First Timothy 3:8-9 says, &ldquo;Deacons...holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.&rdquo; The word <em>holding</em> implies steadfastness. The mystery of the faith is the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh. According to Paul, the elders in the church must be apt to teach the truth, and the deacons must hold fast the mystery of the faith. First Timothy 5:17 says, &ldquo;Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor.&rdquo; Because the elders are so busy, they have no time to make a living. The church should honor them with material giving. Verse 17 continues, &ldquo;...especially those who labor in word and teaching.&rdquo; Here we see some who are laboring and toiling in the word. That means they are spending time and effort in studying and learning the word of God.</p>
<p>Paul said in 2 Timothy 3:15-17, &ldquo;From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.&rdquo; The perfection which Paul rendered Timothy was completely based on the truth of the Bible. Paul said to him, &ldquo;The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also&rdquo; (2:2). The truth that Timothy heard from Paul should not be taught by Timothy alone. Paul charged Timothy to commit it to others that they may teach the same also. Furthermore, Timothy must also cut straight the word of the truth (v. 15).</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING SPIRITUAL EDUCATION IN CLASSES<br />
ON THE LORD&rsquo;S DAY</h2>
<p>Cutting straight the word of the truth is like carpenters cutting wood. They cannot cut according to their own will. They must first draw straight lines on the wood; then they must cut accordingly. When we cut straight the word of the truth, we cannot make it skewed or crooked. The Bible we have in our hand is not an ordinary book. I exhort you young people to read it again and again. We need more Timothys to be raised up among us. In every place we should have some Timothys who can cut straight the truth. After they cut it, they should commit it to those who can teach others the same.</p>
<p>We must be very clear that the church is the pillar and the base of the truth. Hence, the church meeting is a place where we come to learn the truth. In Taiwan, the standard of education is very high; education is also becoming very widespread. This is a worldwide trend. But before God we also need to receive our spiritual education. The church is here to uphold the truth. All the saved ones must come here to receive the proper spiritual education. Even people in the world know that without education a man is wild and unlearned. Once a person has received some education, his behavior will be changed.</p>
<p>We, the saved ones, should always remember that not only do we need God, but we also need to have a clear knowledge of the Bible. You young sisters who are fourteen or fifteen years old will one day be mothers and wives. The best equipping to prepare yourselves to be mothers and wives is the spiritual education.</p>
<p>I always consider that there must have been some reason that God chose Mary to be the mother of Jesus. When Mary was found to be with child, she went to visit her cousin Elizabeth. In Luke chapter one Mary had a psalm of praise to God. That whole psalm was a quotation from the Old Testament. This proves that although Mary had never gone to a seminary, she was very familiar with the Old Testament. No wonder God chose her to be the mother of Jesus. Hence, we must see that Christians need to receive two kinds of education. Not only do they need to receive the worldly education; they must also receive the spiritual education. God&rsquo;s education is a truth education. We must all learn the truth.</p>
 <p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been on the earth for sixty years. Since October 1984, we began to turn our attention from the big meetings to the small meetings. To this day, we are still studying to find a way for all the brothers and sisters to receive spiritual education. Therefore, we made the decision to have classes on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to teach the truth lessons beginning from January 1986. Now a few brothers and I are preparing twenty-four lessons for this kind of teaching. The topics and main points are all there. Our plan is to prepare forty-eight lessons. In each quarter we will cover twelve lessons. There are fifty-two weeks in a year. Besides the forty-eight weeks of proper lessons, we reserve one week at the end of every quarter for review.</p>
<p>The topics we have selected are as follows: The first lesson is on the Bible. The second lesson is on the Triune God. The third lesson is on God&rsquo;s creation. Then we go on to Satan&rsquo;s corruption, and then to God&rsquo;s calling, His promise of redemption, and Abraham. We will cover the Old Testament from Adam to Noah, then from Abraham to Joseph, then from Moses to Samuel, and then from Samuel to David. After we cover all the kings, we will come to the prophets. What we cover will be not just some Bible knowledge and history. All the sections are full of light. You probably have never heard many of these things before. Hence, you must not only bring others to these meetings, but you yourselves must pay attention to all the points. If you do this, in half a year all the brothers and sisters will have gone through twenty-four lessons and will have received a very adequate spiritual education. When we finish forty-eight lessons, we will have covered a year&rsquo;s course. In this way, year after year, in four year&rsquo;s time this spiritual education will become very prevalent among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIVING INTO GOD&rsquo;S WORD FULL-TIME</h2>
<p>In addition, every Lord&rsquo;s Day evening after the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting, we will reserve half an hour for the release or reading of a message on life. Every Tuesday after our prayer meeting, we will also reserve half an hour. The points we cover at that time will not be mainly on life but will be mainly on service, on the spiritual principles of service in spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s Day morning is on one line, covering the truth education. The Lord&rsquo;s Day evening is on another line, on life. Tuesday evening is on the line of service. Then there is the line of the home meetings. In addition to this there is the line of the gospel. Altogether there are five lines.</p>
<p>If we go on in these five lines, we will find out that there are not many who can be faithful to teach others. We need brothers who can minister the word. For this reason we have made the decision to have the full-time co-workers go back to the different meeting halls to concentrate on the ministry of the word. They will take the lessons we wrote and distribute them to the various classes in the various meeting halls. Then they also have to find a message on life for the Lord&rsquo;s Day evening meeting. They also have to find a message on service for the prayer meeting. They must also mark out the portions for the home meetings. Unfortunately, we cannot find twenty-one co-workers to labor full-time in the ministry of the word. This is why I encourage you elders to give up your jobs. The study of God&rsquo;s word requires your whole being to be given. It requires your whole time and energy.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord. Fifty-three years ago I gave up my job to labor full-time in God&rsquo;s word. If my last fifty-three years were spent in my job, not only would it be impossible to produce all the volumes of Life-study messages, but I do not think I would have been able to produce even ten books. During the last fifty-three years I spent all my time in the Bible. Over and over I dig, I read, I study, and I write. On the English side, there are at least three thousand messages that are already in print. On the Chinese side, we have even more. All these require time.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO PRAY, READ, SING, AND SPEAK<br />
GOD&rsquo;S WORD IN OUR DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the key to the home meetings is prayer, reading, singing, and speaking. We cannot wait till the meeting time comes before we do all these four. All the brothers and sisters must exercise in their daily lives to pray, read, sing, and speak.</p>
<p>We must exercise much in prayer. The more we pray, the more we will be freed from all earthly affairs and will be brought into the word of God. When we pray-read, we will also spontaneously sing. The brothers and sisters should buy some song tapes and play them every day at home. While the brothers are driving, they should play them. While the sisters are doing housework, they should also play them. Everyone should learn to sing hymns. In this way it will be easy for us to sing hymns in the meetings.</p>
<p>If we combine our praying, reading, and singing together, the result will be our speaking. The husbands will speak to the wives. The wives will speak to the children. Everyone will speak to his colleagues, and everyone will speak to his neighbors. Whenever we come together, we will simply speak to one another. May the Lord raise up some people in every home meeting to give a strong and weighty ten-minute word at the end of every meeting. I hope that after a period of time, this will be fully realized among us. I believe that this is possible. If a church is rich in truth and strong in the ministry of life, it will surely grow, and the number will surely increase.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRACTICING ONE-ON-ONE,<br />
MAKING HOME DELIVERIES, AND<br />
GIVING INJECTIONS AT HOME</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</h1>
<p>This meeting was called because of an urgent need. This urgent need is still related to the home meetings. You can tell by now that I cannot forget the home meetings even in my dreams. Even though I may be giving other messages, in the end I always come back to the home meetings. I cannot help it. Whatever fills the heart will come out from the mouth. My heart is in the home meetings. My concern is for the home meetings. My joy is in the home meetings, and my complaints are concerning the home meetings. I do not care for anything else. I just care for the home meetings. If we have the home meetings, we can say Hallelujah. If we do not have the home meetings, even if we say Hallelujah, it will not be for long. Only when we have the home meetings will our Hallelujahs be strong and long-lasting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW FOR THE INCREASE<br />
OF THE CHURCH&mdash;THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>I am not joking. Based on my observation from every angle, I am convinced that the increase and spread of the church depend fully on the home meetings. This is based on my sixty years of experience. I have discovered the law for the increase and spread of the church. Everything has its own laws. Science is the discovery of these laws. The law for the increase of the church is the home meetings.</p>
<p>We have been meeting on the island of Taiwan since 1949. It has now been thirty-six years. On the one hand, I have been constantly working. On the other hand, I have been constantly researching in the laboratory. I never stop studying. Today the university education continues to improve every day. The improvement does not come from the classrooms. It comes from the laboratory. We all need an awakening. The less we study, the less we progress. While we work, we must find out the principles and the laws.</p>
<p>For the past five years I have been studying the reason for the lack of growth of the work in Taiwan. Why has there not been any increase in the number of saints in the churches in Taiwan? I have been looking for a reason. Recently the Lord has shown me something. Since I came back last year, I have been speaking about the home meetings. The home meetings are the foundation for the building of the church. If we give up this foundation, surely our number will not increase. Today on the five continents, there are over six hundred churches. The work here in Taiwan is the largest among them all. Of all the six hundred churches, the biggest church is the church in Taipei. For this reason I had to come back here. Taipei is like a source. If we do not take care of the source, if the source is not strong, the other churches will have a difficult time.</p>
<p>At present, there are about eighty churches in Taiwan. There are over twenty churches in Japan, and in Korea there are also over twenty churches. In Malaysia there are also over twenty churches, and in Indonesia the number is between twenty and thirty. In Thailand there are fifteen to twenty churches, and Hong Kong and Singapore have one each. In the Philippines there are over a hundred and thirty. In Australia there are six, and in New Zealand we also have over twelve. In North America, with the United States and Canada together, there are over a hundred and ten churches. In Central and South America there are another hundred churches. Altogether, in the Americas there are over two hundred churches. Another thirty or more are in Europe, and in Africa there are over ten. All these five continents are open to us. Most of these places were raised up through the English publications. All of them are waiting like babies for their parents&rsquo; feeding. Our workers are too few. But I feel that the source of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is in Taiwan. If Taiwan stands still, it will be difficult to move all the other places. When I compared Taiwan with the other places, I had no choice but to sacrifice the other places. I did not do this lightly. I made this decision after much deliberation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SUCCESS OF THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE<br />
DEPENDING ON THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>For years I have been closely watching what others have been doing. Within the last fifteen years the Lord has done many works apart from us. In Seoul, South Korea, a so-called church increased in number from a few thousand to about five hundred thousand in two decades. In Indonesia, a Christian group doubled from fifty thousand to a hundred thousand in three years.</p>
<p>In Singapore the percentage of Christians in the total population is about ten percent. One group among them meets in only a rented auditorium. Yet every Sunday they have eight sessions, each with eight hundred in attendance.</p>
<p>In addition, six years ago a twenty-three year old missionary began working in Manila. Their number increased from four thousand to four sessions of over two thousand each. I am giving you all these examples to show you that within the last fifteen years the Lord has moved on tremendously all over the world. In South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, and Manila the same things are happening. I have lived in the United States for twenty-three years. I have often traveled from place to place. This is the real situation everywhere. The young people in the West now, especially the university students, are very receptive to the gospel. They want the truth. Everywhere the Lord is moving quickly. I have studied very much to find the reason for this. All these places that are increasing at a phenomenal rate have one thing in common: they are all practicing the home meetings.</p>
<p>When we began our work in Taiwan, the number reached such a peak because we practiced the home meetings. Later, we dropped the home meetings. For this reason, the Lord&rsquo;s move among us in the past twenty years has been comparatively slow. Throughout the years, the saints have developed a habit of listening to messages. All the people just gather in the twenty-one meeting halls on Sunday to listen to a message. Last year when I came back I made a turn. But this does not mean that I am abandoning the big meetings. I have said before that the big meetings and the home meetings are like two wings. Praise the Lord, on the whole the brothers and sisters responded quite well. But forgive me for saying that the Chinese disposition is very deliberate. In everything they wait and watch. That being the case, I could only hold back my words. But tonight I am taking the opportunity to express to you some of my frustration. I called this urgent meeting because I want all of you to see the way the Lord is taking, and to respond to it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING ONE-ON-ONE<br />
AND MAKING HOME DELIVERIES</h2>
<p>Now that we have been practicing the home meetings for a year, I am encouraged because I have seen some progress in this area. A few days ago I went to a home meeting. When the time came to start the meeting, no one showed up. I had to help set up the chairs. After the chairs were all set, still no one showed up. I did not say anything, but within myself I was quite agitated. Gradually, I became encouraged because the people began to come. They were all out of breath because they had gone out to bring people to the home meeting. This was a good sign. During the meeting a sister prayed so well that her expression, wording, and tone were just like music. After I asked around, I found out that she had been saved for less than a year. This reminded me not to judge by outward appearance. Now I can see that the saints here either do not make a move at all, or if they do, they make a move that surprises me.</p>
<p>In the churches in Taiwan there are two excellent imports: one is the &ldquo;brothers&rsquo; houses&rdquo; and the other is the &ldquo;one-on-one.&rdquo; The night before last, I attended the prayer meeting here in Hall One. After the meeting I talked with the saints and found out that there are six full-time sisters and two full-time brothers here. I asked where they all lived. One told me that he stays in the Cheng Kung High School brothers&rsquo; house. Another said she stays in the First Girls&rsquo; High School sisters&rsquo; house. I asked how many brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses there are. They told me that there are seven. Then I asked how many stay in each house, and they answered that the average is ten. After I heard this, I realized that this is quite a large number. The brothers&rsquo; houses were invented in America twenty years ago. I strongly recommend them. They are very useful in perfecting the young people.</p>
 <p>The second imported item is the one-on-one. This means to speak the word of the Lord on a one-to-one basis. In this way, others receive the supply, and we ourselves are perfected. Formerly our meetings were like restaurants. But these restaurants were only open for half an hour each week during the home meetings. If you did not come at that time, you would remain hungry. But now, if you cannot come to the home meeting, I will deliver the food to your home. It is all right if you cannot make the meeting. I will deliver the food to your house. I will feed you at a time convenient to you. Through the home meetings, the brothers and sisters will all receive nourishment from the Lord&rsquo;s word, and the word of the Lord will spread everywhere.</p>
<p>In the past we centered too much on the meetings. A home meeting may have eight people who attend a particular meeting, but there may be over a dozen who do not attend. Every one of the eight brothers and sisters who attended the meeting should pick up the burden to visit the other twelve one-on-one. They should bring to them the riches of the home meeting and supply them at their homes. In this way not only will the one who is visited be fed, but also those with him at his home will be supplied. We can also sell the one-on-one to those saints who have a heart to serve, telling them how much we enjoy practicing the one-on-one. The key is to render some supply every week to specific people, using definite materials, and at a definite time and place.</p>
<p>Remember, one-on-one does not mean that others meet you at the meeting hall. It means that you go to visit them at their homes. We have to make home deliveries for them. Twenty years ago I saw people riding on bicycles with signboards saying, &ldquo;Injections given at your home.&rdquo; The patients did not need to go to the hospital. Instead, these people would come to the patients&rsquo; homes to give them the injections. They would come in the morning or in the evening. They would give the injections to the patients while they chatted with them for a minute or two. This is the way we should practice our one-on-one. We should minister Christ by going right into peoples&rsquo; homes. Before we go, it is best if we first practice our speaking with our wife or husband at home.</p><h2 class="head1">SUPPLYING WEEKLY, GIVING INJECTIONS AT HOME</h2>
<p>Starting from December 15, every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning we will be divided into classes for our truth lessons. Then on the Lord&rsquo;s Day evening, after the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting we will reserve half an hour for fellowship concerning a message on life. After the Tuesday evening prayer meeting we will reserve another half an hour for everyone to get into a message on service. After the Thursday evening meeting we will have another half an hour for some related message. By the time the weekend comes, when we come to the home meetings, we will have prepared another message for fellowship. In this way, all the brothers and sisters who come regularly to the church meetings will be supplied by four or five messages per week. Then when you go to visit people one-on-one, you will have at least one or two spiritual messages with which to supply them. It will not be as it was in the past. In the past, whenever you went to visit others, as soon as they saw your face, they only saw the words &ldquo;Come to the meetings&rdquo; written on your forehead.</p>
<p>We should not drag people to meetings anymore. Instead, we should go to their homes to give injections. They cannot come to the meetings because they do not have time. But if you would go to them every week to give them an injection, in the long run you will undoubtedly see results. Before we go out to practice one-on-one, we must first learn the truth. In the church we must first be supplied with messages of life four or five times a week. Only then can we supply others, and only then can those whom we beget be preserved and nurtured. Formerly, many were baptized among us, but few of them remained. This is because we did not have the proper way to nurture them. Or to put it simply, we did not know how to raise them up. Now we need to mend this hole. Not only do we have to beget, but we must nurture as well. And after the nurturing there is still the need for educating.</p>
<p>Previously, the way of the big meetings was like a big family with three generations together. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day all three generations came together. Those who had been saved only a short time were invited to the same table as those who had been saved for a long time. Everyone ate the same food. There was no consideration as to whether the food was suitable for the newborn babes, the toddlers, or those who could only take milk. Now we are practicing the one-on-one. What we are doing is to go to the new ones&rsquo; homes, to lift them up in our arms, and to feed them with milk. Perhaps after half a year, we will not need to go to them anymore; they will be able to come to the table by themselves. The power of the home meeting lies in its potential to nurture. By the time a new one can come to the meetings by himself, he is also ready for teaching. Every week we will teach him with four or five messages. All the teaching will be centered on these messages of life. Gradually, with these two things, nurturing and teaching, as a cycle, he will grow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULL-TIMERS AND THE NEED FOR<br />
THE LARGE MEETING HALL</h2>
<p>There are two more matters that I wish to fellowship with all of you. The first is concerning the matter of the full-timers. The second is concerning the large meeting hall in Lin-Ko. We are looking to the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that through our cooperation with Him, Taiwan could be evangelized in five years. In order to evangelize Taiwan, there must be full-timers. In August, twenty gospel teams went to different places to preach the gospel. In ten days over nine hundred people were gained. Most of them were brought in through the full-timers and the local saints. From this you can see the need for the full-timers.</p>
<p>Our gospel teams have begotten many children in different places. After spending ten days to preach the gospel they came back, and the children were left there. This was a flaw in our victory. Without the proper care, all those newly saved ones were soon scattered. I believe all those sitting here do love the Lord and do love the church and are all concerned about the Lord&rsquo;s move. I would like to tell you that at present we have one hundred and thirty full-time brothers and sisters. Every morning for six months they are receiving proper training in Hall One. They are all college graduates. When I heard their testimonies and prayers and had some contact with them, I was quite encouraged. Praise the Lord that He has raised up such good material. By the time the training ends in May of next year, they will be ready to migrate to the villages.</p>
<p>Let me give you a testimony. On December 31, 1942, we were having a meeting in Chefoo. In the middle of the meeting I picked a hymn:</p>
<p class="hbody">Many crowd the Savior&rsquo;s kingdom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few receive His cross;<br />
Many seek His consolation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few will suffer loss.<br />
For the dear sake of the Master,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting all but dross....</p>
<p class="hbody-hymn"><em>Hymns,</em> #472</p>
<p>When we sang that hymn, everyone in the meeting wept. That day there were about five hundred people in that meeting. Everyone was weeping. I could not sing either. I had to cry with everyone else. The next day was the first day of 1943, and everyone came together again. After this we met continuously for one hundred days. Every day that we met, the number of attendants grew more and more. The hall was filled with people inside and outside, upstairs and downstairs. All the rooms, big or small, were filled with people. No one was idle; no one dropped his job. But every day people walked to the meeting from their homes. There were no cars then. Even the sisters walked every day for half an hour to the meeting hall. The reason our attendance at the home meetings is not high is because we lack a revival among us.</p>
<p>In 1969 we experienced a revival in Elden Hall in America. The meeting began before the brothers and sisters arrived at the meeting hall, while they were still on the way. With their books in their hand, they sang while they walked. It was like the children of Israel ascending Mount Zion for the feast. During the evenings when no meetings were scheduled, I used to take a stroll outside my apartment after dinner. As I was walking, I could hear the sound of singing coming from different homes. Actually, the saints were having home meetings. This situation reached its climax in the summer of 1969. God brought in a revival. The number of brothers and sisters jumped from three or five hundred all the way to seven or eight hundred. The meeting hall could hold only five hundred people. When seven or eight hundred people crowded in the hall, many were forced to stand by the wall.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we need to pray. Within us we need a revival. This is not a matter of outward stirring. It must come from our love to the Lord. When we love the Lord, fellowship with Him, walk according to the Spirit, and are filled in spirit, we will speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and we will sing and praise with our hearts to the Lord. When this happens, the revival will come. When a revival is here, we can have home meetings every night of the week. Everyone will have time. This is the key to the home meetings.</p></body></html>
