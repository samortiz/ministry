   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSONS LEARNED BY A YOUNG BROTHER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL First Letter</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By the Lord's marvelous leading we were able to have two gospel meetings on campus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One meeting was in Professor Guo's home more than thirty people came , and the second meeting was in his laboratory more than one hundred came .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I preached both times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The condition of the first meeting was very good, but some of my inward burden could not be released at the second meeting because there were too many people, and the word was not rich enough.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord has already led us to gradually build up a beachhead among the female students.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are, however, many difficulties: 1 We will be on vacation in two months, and everybody is very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2 There are many activities and clubs on campus which take up much time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many people like to attend them and are not willing to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord's presence and arrangement are too obvious; however, the devil is not happy either.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I hope you will pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please tell me if you have any suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Soon we will have a gospel discussion meeting for people to ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The situation at the Frontier School is becoming more and more difficult, but we are thankful because those whom we have recently baptized really have a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Tomorrow we will have a meeting and give everyone a chance to ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What suggestions do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have much homework, but I have put it aside.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May the Lord bless you!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May 6, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Letter</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The situation at the Frontier School is extremely difficult for many reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is too far from the meeting place, and transportation is a problem because the Number 7 Bus has stopped running.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are only two school buses which shuttle back and forth to the police academy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Walking takes two hours round-trip, and on rainy days only those who really have a heart would walk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are lazy and indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In another month, I will go on vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then semester exams will follow, and I must care for the brothers and sisters in my school.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Time is too short; there is nothing I can do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not know if God wants me to change my direction and stop going to the Frontier School to preach the gospel, and instead bring the more than thirty students who are willing to receive the Lord to a clear knowledge of salvation so that we will have a good foundation before continuing with the spread.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am afraid that everybody is a little tired of always preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What do you think?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The condition of the gospel at Central University is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The brothers and sisters have had a new beginning, and the numbers have increased by fifty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many male and female students as well as janitors are willing to accept the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May the Lord continue His leading and presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I hope that during this summer vacation a few stable brothers and sisters will come to Central University to take the entrance exams so that the gospel will have a way to spread further.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I deeply believe that the Lord will give you a burden to pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope you can come soon to point out the way ahead of us in the Lord's light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May the Lord be magnified!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May 10, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Third Letter</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The condition of the Frontier School has not changed much.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do not think we are without a way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we only had a bus to pick up students and take them back, the difficulty could be resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The original Number 7 Bus stopped running, so unless a person's heart is really drawn by the Lord's love, it is hard to walk for one hour to the meetings, especially on rainy days.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The brothers who are weak physically feel that their heart is willing, but they do not have enough strength.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am looking to the Lord to resolve this difficulty for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the Lord has mercy on us, there may be a beginning at Jin-Ling Nanking University; however, because of the heavy religious background, one can expect that road to be tortuous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I will report to you when something has started.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The meetings at Central University have started.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord has also added saved ones to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Presently, we have almost forty people meeting together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Professor Guo's house is already too small, and we have moved to his laboratory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My heart feels that it is getting harder and harder for me to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are so many things happening outwardly, yet I am so dark inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I lack real revelation and light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am still my old self; I have not learned anything new, nor do I have a stronger heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Without the Lord's mercy, I will stumble and fall.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I really hope the Lord will give you the burden to pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May the Lord draw me again so that I may rise up to seek and know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only the Lord knows my pitiful, desolate condition!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I know that you are pressed for time, but I hope you will say a few words to me from the heart and answer the questions I have asked.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Respectfully,</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Chong-en</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May 24, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A first-year medical student at Central University, Nanking</S>
