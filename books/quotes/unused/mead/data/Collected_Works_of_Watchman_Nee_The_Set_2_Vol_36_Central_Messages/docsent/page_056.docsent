   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After understanding the meaning of Christ being our life, we now come to the question of Christ becoming our wisdom from God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, you have been a Christian for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do you have anything other than your own wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Have you received the Lord Jesus as your wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Has the Lord Jesus been your wisdom once?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How much have you known the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the basic question, and we must be clear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse does not say that the Lord Jesus gives us wisdom; it does not say that God has given us the Lord Jesus' wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It does not say that we understand and know how to speak or act, even though we were once foolish, because God has given us wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No, the Bible does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible says that Christ became wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word "became" is very important, and there is no better word than this word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can take the story of Moses and Aaron as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moses was afraid of speaking to the Israelites; he was afraid because he was not eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He said that he was slow of speech and of a slow tongue; therefore, he dared not go.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What did God say?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He said, "Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?...He shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth" Exo 4:14, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Does this mean that when Aaron became Moses' mouth, Moses became eloquent?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No, Aaron only became Moses' mouth, but Moses was still Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, Moses spoke later.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But that is a different story.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Moses' eloquence failed, he could ask Aaron to speak for him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the meaning of Aaron becoming Moses' mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Aaron became Moses' mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The eloquence was still with Aaron; it was not with Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moses needed Aaron to be the mouth, because his own mouth did not work as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It does not mean that after Moses took Aaron as his mouth, his own mouth became eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After we see the meaning of Aaron becoming the mouth of Moses, we see the meaning of Christ becoming wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It does not mean that Christ has made us wise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, it means that we are foolish, but we allow the Lord to become our wisdom while we do not move.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Originally, when there were demands from the outside, we reacted with our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today when there are demands from the outside, we know that we cannot make it and should not react anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should allow the Lord's life to react.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not a matter of becoming better in ourselves; it is a matter of the Lord living on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moses' mouth did not improve.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, Aaron became his mouth for him and spoke instead of him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ being our wisdom is like Aaron speaking on Moses' behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose you are going to speak to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What are you going to do when you cannot say what you want to say?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may ask another one who has come with you to speak for you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You cannot speak yourself, and you ask him to speak; he meets the demand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While he is speaking, your mouth remains dumb; it has not improved, and you are still the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must never think that when Christ becomes our wisdom, we become wise.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must remember that even when Christ has become our wisdom, we can still do nothing in ourselves.2</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Galatians 2:20 says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This shows us how a Christian should live.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He should live by not doing anything by himself, but by allowing Christ to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, let Aaron speak and Moses be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some people are not eloquent, yet they need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What do they do?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They ask you to speak for them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But while you are speaking, they are not satisfied; they interrupt with a word or two.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This makes it very difficult for you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If Moses' mouth could not speak, he should take Aaron's mouth as his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thank the Lord that this is God's way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God did not change Moses' mouth; rather, He gave him a new mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God does not change a person's mouth; He gives him another mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God does not change a foolish man into a wise man; rather, He causes Christ to become wisdom to the foolish man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brothers and sisters, this is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God has not changed foolish men into wise; rather, He has made Christ our wisdom; Christ has become wisdom to us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Suppose a matter needs great wisdom to handle and settle it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may try this way and that way in vain; your little mind may be exhausted, yet you still cannot come up with a solution.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then you say, "Lord, I am foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If it is left up to me to do, I will surely not be able to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I can only look to You.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You do it for me."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After you have trusted in the Lord this way, the Lord may direct you to do something, say something, or take some action, and you may not even be aware of the great wisdom involved in doing these things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But after you have done them, one day you will say, "What I did that day was not something that I could have done by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What I said that day was not something that I could have said by myself."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This means that you have not changed at all; it was the Lord who became your wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is Christ becoming wisdom to you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Originally, we had to handle things by ourselves, yet we could not handle them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>So we allowed Christ to be our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have to remember that Christ's wisdom does not become our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In addition, Christ is not giving us wisdom so that we can become wise.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Instead, Christ in us is becoming wisdom to us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Wisdom belongs to the Lord and not to us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is our wisdom; He is becoming our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brothers and sisters, if we know what it means for Christ to "become," we can live a proper life before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We have previously said that Christ becoming our wisdom means three things: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What do these things mean?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Let us first consider righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then we will speak on the other two.</S>
