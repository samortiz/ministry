<h2 class="head2">Swatow, Kwangtung Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings:</p><p>Enclosed please find X dollars collected from the offering box for the work in the remote regions and X dollars for the brothers and sisters in need. We are sending both amounts through postal wire. Please accept them and use them according to the Lord's will.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun, Chen Fang-ching<br />May 3<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Brother Wu Ren-jieh is still in the region of Chuenchow. Sister Chen Wuan-ching is still in Kulangsu. The meeting hall in Kulangsu has been declared a refugee center. Dr. Chai Ming-ju's family has long moved to Kulangsu. Some believers in Swatow have already moved inland. I received a letter from Brother Chen Wen-kwang. He has recovered seventy to eighty percent from his illness. He will continue to take a vacation for two months so that he may fully recover. Sister Lin Lee Tsuo-yu will go to Singapore on the thirty-first of this month. Sister Huang Hwei-min and Sister Chai Lan-jen will go to Siam soon.</p><p>Your brother,<br />James Chen<br />May 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Wei-Hai-Wei, Manchuria</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother Witness:</p><p>Although we do not often write, I remember you often in my prayers. I hope the God of grace and peace will keep us on the way, amen. My spirit is very peaceful and happy here. The strongest word that I have read recently is, "Deny yourself, pick up your cross, and follow the Lord." This word has been operating in me. Brother! It is so easy to say these words, but it is very difficult to practice them! May the Lord give me revelation that I may overcome my self and everything else by relying on Him. My time is not on a definite schedule (because of my job), so I can only pray and read the Bible with my wife and children. Wei-Hai-Wei is sometimes not peaceful. It is very difficult to travel. How is it in Chefoo? I hope you remember me, your weak brother, in your prayers. I also hope you can find some time to write a letter and help me. This is my hope, but I know that you are busy. Please forgive me. Peace in the Lord. Greet all the brothers and sisters who meet at Shuang-He-Li.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Shien-huei</p>
