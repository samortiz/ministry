God the Father is embodied in God the Son, and God the Son is realized, transmitted, experienced and gained by us in God the Spirit
Our spirit is the means for us to contact the Triune God; therefore the human spirit is a great thing in the universe
In chapter seven of John, the Lord Jesus was still in the flesh; He was not yet in glory, that is, not yet in resurrection
After His resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ
If the Spirit did not contain the elements of incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, why would He be called the Spirit of Jesus?
When all the aspects and elements of the Spirit are put together we have a totality a final product known in the New Testament as the Spirit
In the last lesson we saw that the divine Spirit was only the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah in the Old Testament
The all-inclusive Spirit was 'not yet' because the Triune God had not yet passed through the steps of His process
Every ingredient of this compound ointment and its unit of measure shows us something very significant about the Spirit
According to John 19, when Nicodemus and others were preparing to bury the body of the Lord Jesus, they used myrrh
Those who say that the Bible is not the Word of God have surely never seen the wonderful picture of the compound ointment
The four spices symbolize four elements that have been added to the Spirit: myrrh , cinnamon , calamus , and cassia
Not only did Christ go to the cross, but the very man God had put on Himself with the entire creation went to the cross with Him
When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, it was the life-giving Spirit who came into us
Many believers do not realize that they received the Lord Jesus not only as the Redeemer and the Savior, but also as the life-giving Spirit
Although we received Him as our Redeemer, He came into us not only as our Redeemer, but also as the life-giving Spirit
If you ask believers where their Redeemer, the Lord Jesus, is, many lift up their eyes, point to heaven, and say, 'He is in heaven'
Rarely do you find a Christian who, when asked where the Lord Jesus is, will say with rejoicing, 'Christ is in me'!
When we are happy with Him, attending the meetings, praying, and pray-reading, we may not have a strong sense that He is within
God has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because they are ranked among the Triune God in verses 4 and 5
Is the number of completion in God's dispensational move, while twelve is the number of completion in God's eternal administration
In the book of Revelation the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls are all for God's dispensational move
As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits are for God's move on the earth
In substance and existence, God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold
We all are familiar with three-way bulbs, light bulbs that can be switched to three successive degrees of illumination
In the four Gospels, the Spirit of God was one-fold because at that time there was not the need for so much light
In existence, the Holy Spirit, like the lampstand in Zechariah, is one, but in function the Holy Spirit is seven
The verses show us clearly that the stone is just Christ Himself and that this stone is related to the building of God's house
Today, the life-giving Spirit must be the flaming Spirit, and the transforming Spirit must be the searching and judging Spirit
We are not here for doctrine and teaching; we are here under the enlightening of the pure Word and under the searching of the seven Spirits
The sevenfold Spirit purifies, infuses and transforms the believers to make them precious stones fit for the New Jerusalem
Because this point is such a significant and crucial truth regarding the Spirit, we must consider it once again
God's purpose is that we may obtain His own uncreated life and be transformed by this life into His image to be like Him
Even if our human life had not been corrupted by the fall of man in Genesis 3, we would still need to be regenerated
God's purpose in creating man is not merely to obtain a sinless man, but even more to have a God-man, one who has God's own life and nature
Using the illustration of a dog receiving a human life, we see that the natural concept is merely that a dog can be cleansed and beautified
The highlight is that God has regenerated us, that He has actually imparted His life and nature into us to make us His sons
Certainly there is no greater wonder in the whole universe than that sinful men by being regenerated can become sons of God
Thessalonians 2:13 says, 'God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth'
By taking the Word in this way, we have the clear conviction that something of the Lord has been wrought into us
After we repent and are justified, the Spirit continues to sanctify us on two sides, positionally and dispositionally
In the previous lesson we saw the matter of sanctification, the imparting of the divine life into our entire being
Regeneration has been accomplished in our spirit, but after regeneration, we still need the transformation in the soul
They think that as long as it is not sinful, it is quite all right, but this is merely the human thought and the natural concept
If they would be transformed by the renewing of their mind, their thoughts about their manner of dress would change
Not until they love the Lord more and give the Lord more ground to work within them will they be transformed in their way of spending money
We have Christ as life within our spirit, but now we need Christ to spread into the inward parts of the soul and saturate them with Himself
With an unveiled face we shall behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and be transformed into His image from glory to glory
Transformation is the change or reaction in our being that results from the divine life being imparted into us
In this lesson we shall consider some symbols that the New Testament uses to describe the work of the Spirit in us
The Greek word for 'pledge' is somewhat equal to today's down payment, which indicates good faith and is a guarantee of coming payments
Pledge, earnest, and guarantee all these words are about the same in meaning, all referring to a payment that guarantees the balance
As those who are to inherit God, we have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, guarantee, earnest, and down payment of our inheritance
You have to believe that when you speak, the Holy Spirit always follows your speaking and honors your speaking, and people will be saved
Those who are not eloquent, and who may even mispronounce words, may have impact and power in their gospel preaching
If we trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, the Lord may even use speaking with the wrong pronunciation of words to save others
If we would be faithful to speak in this way, surely many of our dear friends and relatives would be brought to the Lord
Even the young saints can preach with power and impact if they would trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit
In the last lesson we pointed out that in order to preach the gospel effectively we must gain a rich deposit from the Word
It is clear that the spirit mentioned in all these verses does not refer to the divine Spirit but to the human spirit, our spirit
If you will just confess that one thing, that initial confession will be a little turn to lead you onto the highway
It is best to get away by yourself, away from the phone and everyone else, or at least take the phone off the hook
The Bible speaks a great deal about the human spirit because our spirit is the key to experiencing the divine Spirit
A purified conscience helps the other parts of our inward being to function properly and keeps the Lord flowing within us
There's no possibility for the soulish man to know God, but in the following verse it says the spirit, the human spirit, knows
With the soulish man there is no possibility to know God, but with the spiritual man there is the full possibility
When we say that we live by our spirit, we need to see that this means our spirit now has become a being with life in it
Formerly the two organs were the body and the spirit; now the second organ is no longer the spirit, but the soul
Hebrews 4:12 says that the living word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit
In the Epistles, we are always told that we have to walk according to spirit, live in the spirit, and do things by the spirit
Because we are so much in the soul, in the mind, emotion, and will, our human spirit does not have the chance, the ground, to do anything
At other times, however, you love certain brothers so much, simply because you are in the emotion, in the soul
If you would deny your emotion, deny your self, your love toward that brother would be transformed from the soul into the spirit
A spiritual person is one who is so keen in the understanding of the mind, so emotional in his love and affection, and so strong in his will
Now, when the Spirit of God enters, He not only quickens our spirit, but also adds the life of God into our spirit
Now not only is our spirit alive, but it also has the life of God; and it is not only a spirit; it is the spirit of life
When we have such feelings, we know we are minding the spirit, walking according to the spirit, and living in the spirit
The spirit itself is relatively difficult for us to sense, but we can easily sense such feelings of life in the spirit
The life of God in our spirit can be said to be God Himself; therefore, the sense of this life surely will make us sense God Himself
Because God Himself is in our spirit, we sense life and peace when our mind is set on the spirit and we are living in our spirit
The Christian life is not a matter of right and wrong; it is a matter of living by the inner sense of the spirit
Regardless of how young or new you may be, if you are a child of God, the Spirit of God witnesses with your spirit
If it said 'in our spirit,' it would mean that only the Spirit of God witnesses, but that our spirit does not witness
When our spirit witnesses, that is also the witnessing of the Spirit, because the two spirits have been mingled together as one
My advice to him would be that if he can participate in that athletic activity according to the spirit, then he should go ahead and do so
As Christians, we should not decide matters according to right or wrong; rather, we should decide them according to the spirit
The Spirit who is mingled with our spirit and according to whom we may have our very being is the wonderful Spirit of the Triune God
The inward filling Spirit the essential Spirit is in the disciples whereas the outward filling Spirit the economical Spirit is upon them
They completely disregard God's work and God's plan; neither do they desire to have power to work for God and fulfill His plan
We must get fully cleared up through prayer by confessing all our failures, wrongdoings, mistakes, sinful things, offenses, etc
If we have not gone to the Lord in this way for some time we may need one or even two hours to be fully cleansed
Neither should we wonder what will happen or how we will feel when we are filled inwardly and outwardly with the Spirit
After Ephesians 5:18 says, 'Be filled in spirit,' verse 19 continues, 'Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs'
Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing and psalming, but also for speaking to one another
Such speaking, singing, and psalming are not only the outflow of being filled in spirit, but also the way to be filled in spirit
According to the New Testament, psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are good not only for singing, but also for speaking
The inward filling is the essential aspect of the Spirit, whereas the outward filling is the economical aspect of the Spirit
We have to walk according to our spirit because today the Holy Spirit is within our spirit and is even one with our spirit
When we walk according to our spirit, spontaneously we walk according to the Holy Spirit, because the two spirits are one
Most people walk and do things according to the mind, according to what they think, and according to what they like
It is easy to discern the spirit from the flesh, but sometimes it is not easy to discern the spirit from the mind
Perhaps, for example, you may be thinking about visiting a brother, but deep within something is bothering you
You should walk not according to your thinking or your likes and dislikes but just according to the inner red light or the inner green light
Every day, from morning till evening, cease from your doing and seek to constantly remain in this mingled spirit
While your classmates are talking in a worldly way, you may find yourself, at a certain point, unable to join in the conversation
Your classmates may be discussing sinful things in a happy, excited way, but the divine life within you does not allow you to say a word
In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about
For God's purpose, we need to have a walk that is orderly, a walk that is according to certain elementary rules or basic principles
We may use the daily life of a young sister who is a student to illustrate the two kinds of walk by the Spirit
On the other hand, she needs to be a proper student at school and fulfill all the requirements leading to graduation
Paul's intention in writing to the Galatians was to tell them that they should no longer take the law as their rule
According to 5:25, since we have received life and live by the Spirit, we should now have the second walk by the Spirit as our rule
The first aspect is a matter of the Christian life a life matter and the second aspect is a matter of the Christian service a service matter
Immediately following this parable, the Lord gave us the parable of the talents, which is something related to our service
We need to use the talent, the gift, which the Lord has given us, to do some business and to make some profit for the Lord
We need to grow in life with the oil, with the light, and with the going out of this world to meet the Lord in His coming back
The service we are talking about is certainly not the so-called 'Sunday morning service' to which many Christians are accustomed
Neither is it just to perform some work such as cleaning the church meeting hall, although that can be part of serving
If others cannot sense Christ in the kitchen while you are cooking, it is doubtful that they will sense Him in the meetings in a real way
The hand is good, quite useful, but if it is cut off from the body, it becomes not only dead, but also ugly, terrible, and even terrifying
The members of the body are beautiful as long as they are attached where they belong in the body, but in any other place they are terrible
From that time, we need to learn to live, to walk, to act in the spirit, not in the mind or emotion, not in the soul
We need to learn not only to walk, to live, in the spirit but also to serve in the spirit, and to serve in the newness of the spirit
To walk, to live, in our spirit means that we will be in the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit is now indwelling our spirit
The real service is to minister Christ in whatever we do, whether it is gospel preaching or cleaning the meeting hall
He says the Spirit of God dwells in you; that without the Spirit of Christ you are not of Him; that Christ is in you
We should not be content with outwardly worshipping Him, loving Him, fearing Him, and doing things to please Him
When every part of us is saturated with this all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, we are in the union that God wants
As the mind is set on the spirit, the mind becomes life and eventually life is given even to our mortal bodies
If you open your eyes, all the doubts are gone, all the questions are gone, and you do know what the particular color is
You may not be able to explain what you see, but your eyes can substantiate the colors and can distinguish one color from another
In chapter four of Ephesians, after the strengthening in the inner man, there is the renewing of the spirit of the mind
The mind should be set upon the spirit and the mind should be governed possessed occupied taken over controlled and subdued by the spirit
All of us need to be renewed again and again, daily, hourly, moment by moment, all the time, in, with, and by such a renewing spirit
Through this process there is brought into being a hybrid life, an entity composed of the mingling of the divine life with the human life
When we do this, the life-giving Spirit comes into our spirit, and the mingling of the divine life and human life takes place within us
The churches are the lampstands, and the lamps are the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as the expression of Christ
In today's dark age, the church really needs the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God to shine forth the testimony of Jesus
The twelve gates of the New Jerusalem, which are twelve pearls , signify God the Son's overcoming death and His life-imparting resurrection
Christ's overcoming death plus His life-imparting resurrection secretes the 'juice' of the divine life to form us into pearls
After regeneration, the Spirit continues to transform the regenerated people of God to make every one of them a precious stone
In his Gospel John prepares the way to show us that these three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not separate
He is qualified to be such a husband to marry the wife, who is the consummation of all the redeemed and regenerated people of God
The processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit dispenses Himself into man and mingles with man to produce the church
Because the Spirit is the reality of Christ, the more we are mingled with the Spirit, the more we become the embodiment of Christ
We also become the lampstands shining with the sevenfold intensified Spirit in a dark age as the testimony of Jesus
The New Jerusalem as the consummate issue of the Triune God dispensed into man will express the Triune God for eternity
