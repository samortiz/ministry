   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When the Lord Jesus comes, the whole earth will be under one landlord and one banker.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the land will belong to Christ, and we shall hand over whatever we have and whatever we are to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are the enjoyers, not the lords.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time in Egypt everything was under the hand of one lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Joseph moved the people to cities "from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof" 47:21 in order to have an even distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were no rich and no poor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the same today regarding the spiritual supply.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ has the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The amount of these riches that He is able to supply us depends on what we are willing to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are willing to make the first payment, then we shall receive the first supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if we are willing to make the other payments, we shall receive more supply.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we make the fourth payment, we shall receive not only the food to satisfy ourselves, but also the seed to produce something for others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How marvelous this is!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you study Genesis 47, you will see that eventually the whole land of Egypt became a land of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No longer were there distinctions between high and low and rich and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the people became enjoyers on the same level because everyone and everything was under the same lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a picture of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the millennium there will be no capitalism or socialism.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone will be on the same level because everything will be under the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He will have bought everything, and He will have claimed everything and everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Truly the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof Psa 24:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The situation during the millennium will be very different from today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before Joseph came to the throne, the people were on different levels.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But after he was enthroned and the people came to him for food, Egypt became a prefigure of the millennium with all the people on the same level.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything was under one man and belonged to him because that man had the riches and could claim everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It must be this way among us in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Christ has claimed everything of us, we all are now on the same level enjoying the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the points mentioned above also are seeds that are developed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Joseph not only supplied the people with food, but also took care of his father's burial 49:29-31; 50:1-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The burial of Jacob was not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Hebrews 11, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all received the promise of the good land, but died without inheriting it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a strong indication of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Abraham died with the expectation that he would be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No doubt Isaac and Jacob had the same concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jacob died in the hope that one day he would rise up to inherit the land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this reason, he charged Joseph not to leave his body in Egypt, but to bury him in the land of his fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jacob realized that death to him was a time of sleeping and that on the day of resurrection he would rise up to inherit the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the significance of the burial of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fact that Joseph buried him according to his request indicates that he had the same faith as his father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He also believed that they would rise up to inherit the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Joseph also supported his brothers and comforted them 50:15-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Joseph's brothers could not forget what they had done to him, and they were afraid that after their father's death Joseph would do something to get revenge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Joseph wept when he heard his brothers' request, for he had no thought of rendering evil to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, he said, "Fear not: for am I in the place of God?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive" 50:19-20, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Joseph also promised to support them and their little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then he comforted them and spoke kindly to them 50:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Joseph seemed to be saying to his brothers, "Your intention was evil, but God's intention was marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He intended to send me here to save many lives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please do not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I thank you for what you did to me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You helped God to fulfill His purpose."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the church life we need this kind of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even if others offend you, you need to consider that whatever they do to you is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you take everything as of God, all the offenses will be over.</S>
