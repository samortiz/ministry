<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE PRACTICE</h2><h2 class="head2">Finding the Ones to Submit To</h2><p>After we have such a realization, we come to the second step. The first step has to do with God's word. The second step has to do with us. First, we must have God's word. Then this word must be applied to us. In the Body the first thing we have to learn is to find those whom we have to submit ourselves to. We must know those who are ahead of us. All the authorities in the Bible are deputy authorities and not direct authorities. What we have to learn is not to have others submit to us, but to submit ourselves to others. When I go to work, I do not first ask who my subordinates are. Rather, I must first ask who my superior is. If you go to another person's house to be the maid, you do not first ask who the children are, but who the lady of the house is. If we allow the inner life to operate freely, we will find the ones whom we have to submit to. We may think that submission will make us unhappy. Actually, the opposite is true; submission makes a happy person, and insubordination makes an unhappy person. Only when we submit to one another will there be coordination one with another. This kind of coordination is most pleasant. The real submission is not one that is imposed from without, but one that comes as a result of the operation of the life within. It is wrong to submit to anyone because of his high position or material riches. To do so would make us no different from today's political organizations. Our submission is not brought about by any outward factors, but by the demand of the life within.</p><p>This kind of submission may bring us tears. Yet, at the same time it brings us joy. We may feel that we are suffering, but at the same time, we are rejoicing. Sometimes the ones whom you submit to may give you a hard time, but you can still say "amen.'' This is true submission. True submission neither makes a person suffer nor causes him to feel happy. However, it draws an "amen'' from his spirit and gives him peace in his spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping and Coordinating Together</h2><p>If we see the Body of Christ, we will see the matter of fellowship. The life that we received from the Lord makes us pliable and enables us to coordinate together. In this coordination there is no friction and there is no murmuring. To have such things in the Body would make us no different from the political organizations in the world.</p><p>In the Bible the Lord often did not speak to men directly. On the one hand, the New Testament says that a man can know God from within. On the other hand, we have to see that after the Lord met Saul, He did not speak to him directly. Instead, He asked Ananias to go to speak to Saul (Acts 9:6). On the one hand, the life that is seen in the New Testament is a very personal one. On the other hand, the Epistle of John says that "you also may have fellowship with us'' (1 John 1:3). This fellowship is mutual. On the one hand, we come to God individually by the blood and through the veil. On the other hand, we work together, walk together, coordinate together, and serve together. There are those who serve, and there are those who are served. From the records concerning Paul, Luke, Timothy, and others, we see that among them there was coordination. Whatever Paul suggested, the others would agree and carry it out right away. Timothy was a good brother. He could have written a letter to Paul, saying, "Brother Paul, I have believed in the Lord for many years. I can pray, and I can seek after the Lord. Please give me some liberty!'' But Timothy did not do this. On the one hand, every person comes to God independently and is individually responsible to God. On the other hand, no one can be independent, and no one can be free. If you are not coordinated with others, you do not have to tell others; within you, you know it yourself.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Delivered from the Self</h2><p>A man's mouth may be very clever, but his mouth does not necessarily represent his person. Sometimes, a person may say "yes'' with his mouth, yet disagree within. Some brothers and sisters only bring their mouths to the meetings; they themselves are not in the meetings. One sister once came to me to discuss the question of submission in the family. Her mouth was saying that she wanted me to handle the matter. But I knew clearly within me that her mouth and her ears had come, but that her being had not come. Once a person has given up his personal opinions, even though he may not readily consent with his mouth, he will acknowledge within that this is the right thing to do.</p><p>We have to learn to be persons who are delivered from ourselves. If fifty radios are receiving the same signal from a station, and my radio receives a different signal from the same station, my radio is definitely not functioning properly. Although we live under the New Testament and although we have the Lord within us, we are at the same time living in the Body. Therefore, there is the need for us to be joined to the other members. In the coordination of the Body, we have to learn to care for the feeling of the other members of the Body. Only then can we have good coordination.</p>
