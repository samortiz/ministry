   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may apply this now to the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the basic elements in the learning of Christ are truth and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In contrast to the Gospel of John, in Ephesians 4 truth precedes grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Truth is not the supply; it is the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, truth is the principle, the pattern, the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As members of the Body of Christ under the Head, we are learning Christ as the truth is in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before he mentions grace here, Paul presents the principle, the pattern, the standard; that is, he presents the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all have been baptized not into grace, but into the mold, into the pattern, which is the life of truth in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have been placed by God through baptism into the pattern, the standard, the principle, set up by the living of the Lord Jesus on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the truth in Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. Grace</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to live out such a standard, we must have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 29 Paul relates grace to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that we need grace for the details of our daily life, not just for what we regard as important matters.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may have grace in big matters, but not in small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, a brother may have grace to minister the Word, but he may lack grace in speaking to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, in the prayer meeting we may all have grace, but in our daily conversation we may be devoid of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In no area of our daily life do we require grace more than in our conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we have grace in this aspect of our living, we shall have grace in every other aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In all things we need grace to live a life according to the truth that is in Jesus and to be molded into the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Grace is our rich supply and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we have this supply and enjoyment, we shall be able to live according to the standard of the principle of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason Paul takes truth and grace as the basic elements in his exhortation in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BASIC FACTORS A. On the Positive Side</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Along with these basic elements, there are also some basic factors.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the positive side, these factors are the life of God v. 18 and the Spirit of God v. 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Life of God</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In contrast to the Gentiles, we are not strangers to the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of being alienated from the life of God, we are attached to the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The life of God has become a fountain within our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hallelujah for the life supply within us!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit of God</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We also have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit of God is the Person of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God Himself in the Person of the Spirit dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must be careful, therefore, not to grieve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, we should obey Him, honor Him, respect Him, and be one with Him at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>B. On the Negative Side</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The basic factor on the negative side is the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verse 27 Paul exhorts us not to give place to the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although we have the life of God and the Spirit of God within us, the enemy is still lurking about us; he is always seeking an opportunity to gain an advantage over us or to damage us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to be on the alert for this crouching enemy.</S>
