   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Ephesians 1 the most striking thing is the dispensing plus the transmitting.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The dispensing is done by the processed Trinity, and the transmitting is done by the transcending Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What the Trinity dispenses is for producing the many sons of God, the heritage to God as His treasure, His private possession, and a glorified body as the consummation of the Trinity's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is revealed in verses 3 through 14.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these verses there are the many sons of God, God's heritage, and our glorified body, but the church is not yet mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to realize that these items are all for the church, the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The dispensing of the processed Trinity produces the constituents for the church, but there is still the need for the formation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The formation of the church does not depend upon the Trinity's dispensing but upon the transcending Christ's transmission with His surpassing, transcending power which raised Him up from the dead, seated Him at the throne of God, subjected all things under His feet, and made Him the Head over all things to the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was told many years ago that the book of Ephesians is on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I was with the Brethren, they told me that Adam and Eve were a type of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, I met Brother Watchman Nee and became one of his close co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He told us strongly that the church comes out of Christ just as Eve came out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That was a great help to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is wonderful to see that the church has come out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But still at that time in my studying of the holy Word, I had not entered into the intrinsic significance of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For years I was wondering how the church comes out of Christ and how Christ produces the church with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, I came out of mainland China and stayed in Taiwan from 1949 to 1961.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During that period of time, the Lord opened my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I saw that the coming out of the church is altogether a matter by the Holy Spirit and in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without these two spirits the Holy Spirit and our spirit there is no possibility to have the coming out of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no possibility for the church to come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE DIVINE SANCTIFICATION FOR SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also have seen something further concerning the truth of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This has been a great subject among us in the recovery for the past seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We studied and investigated this, spending much time to get into others' writings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we were not fully satisfied with what we had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was not until this year, 1993, that I saw the full intrinsic significance of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I saw this when the church in Anaheim was spending time to review our life-study on Hebrews, which was given in 1975.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That life-study was very thorough, yet I did not see fully at that time how the sanctification of the Spirit is related to the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hebrews 2:10 says that the Lord as the Captain of God's salvation will lead many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then verse 11 speaks of the One who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I considered these two verses, my eyes were opened to see that sanctification is for sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is new light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I saw this, I entered into a fuller understanding of Ephesians 1:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 4 says "to be holy," and verse 5 says "unto sonship."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to put these two phrases together "to be holy unto sonship."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows us again that sanctification is for sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Greek preposition for the word unto is very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It means "resulting in."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be holy results in the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's sonship comes to us through the Holy Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The concluding notes of chapter one of this book point out that the divine sanctification is unto the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I hope that the Lord will have mercy on all of us to pick up this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Divine sanctification is not for sinless perfection nor is it merely for a change of our position.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is for the sonship and results in the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We call it the divine sanctification because it is a matter of the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a matter of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now I would like to present a full view of the divine sanctification as unveiled in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Based upon His desire, He made an intention with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is His eternal economy, oikonomia Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>. This economy was made by the Father, accomplished by the Son, and carried out and applied to us by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The carrying out of the eternal economy of God is by the Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit's sanctification is the carrying out of God's eternal purpose in four steps.</S>
