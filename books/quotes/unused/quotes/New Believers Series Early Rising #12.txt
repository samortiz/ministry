Many children of God lead a sick life, not because they have spiritual problems, but because they rise up too late
Many children of God have no lack in consecration, zeal, or love, but they cannot live a normal Christian life because they rise up too late
Many people have been Christians for years, yet they fail to live a proper Christian life because they rise up too late
The moment we believe in the Lord, we should set apart the early morning for fellowshipping with God and for contacting Him
Every one of them had the habit of waking early in the morning and fellowshipping with God early in the morning
Any brother or sister who wants to follow the Lord must never think that there is little difference in rising up an hour early
Although one may spend the same amount of time in reading the Bible, an hour's difference will produce very different results
One brother was asked at least fifty times during his first three years as a Christian, 'What time did you get up this morning'?
How about the servants of God who are not mentioned in the Bible, like George Muller, John Wesley, and many other famous servants of God?
We can give it another name, but no matter what name we give to it, meeting God early in the morning is a very crucial matter
To fellowship means to open up our spirit and our mind to God and allow Him to enlighten us, speak to us, impress us, and touch us
Read a single portion of the Bible carefully, always mingling your reading with unceasing communion with God and singing
If you maintain this practice before God every morning, you will be filled after some time, and God's word will dwell in you richly
After one fellowships, praises, and eats manna, he has strength and can present everything in prayer before God
After you do this for a few days, you will not want to go back to sleep even if your mind is telling you to do so
Those who are not advised by doctors to stay in bed and who are not really sick should rise up early in the morning
It is unfortunate that some have been Christians for years and yet have never enjoyed the blessing of early rising
If more brothers and sisters will come together to learn this lesson and if everyone will rise up early in the morning the church will grow
If every brother and sister takes this way, there will be many containers before God, and we will be richer and richer as the days go by
If we all learn to rise up early, and if we all maintain this habit, we will have a bright spiritual future ahead of us
