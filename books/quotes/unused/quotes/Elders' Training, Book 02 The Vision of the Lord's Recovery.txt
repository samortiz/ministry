As the Lord's recovery is continually spreading throughout the world, these messages are more than crucial and urgently needed
Our hope and expectation is that these messages will become a governing and controlling vision for all in the Lord's recovery
In these chapters we could only summarize the crucial points of the vision the Lord has given to us in a very brief and concise way
We need the realization of the Father as the source, though we do not need much explanation concerning this point
In addition, we need to see that even the Father Himself is triune, and He is triune not only in one way but in three ways
Revelation 1:4 speaks of the first of the Trinity as He who is, and who was, and who is coming, or who is to come, or who is to be
Undoubtedly, such an expression is based upon the revelation of the Old Testament where Jehovah is referred to
We may say that the Father God is triune in relation to His person, in relation to time, and in relation to space
We have touched something of our vision concerning God and concerning the Father; now we come to our vision concerning the Son, Jesus Christ
The New Testament does not say the Word was God the Son; in fact, it does not say God the Son, nor God the Father, nor God the Spirit
The New Testament says that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was the entire God the Triune God the Father the Son and the Spirit
Strictly speaking, the New Testament does not say that the Word became a man, but it says that the Word became flesh
To say only that Christ became a man does not definitely denote that man was in a fallen condition at the time of the incarnation
According to the New Testament usage, to say that the Word became flesh definitely indicates that 'the flesh' refers to the fallen man
Christ did not become a man before the fall, but He did so after the fall, while man was absolutely living in the fall
The brass serpent lifted up on the pole in Numbers 21 was a representative of the people bitten by the serpents
They themselves were not judged, but they were judged in and through their representative, which was the serpent made of brass
From the Gospel of John we can see that the incarnated One was in the form of a fallen man, but He did not have the fallen nature
Paul gives us an even stronger verse that corresponds to Romans 83 in 2 Corinthians 521 Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf
When we say that God made Christ sin, we have Paul's word in 2 Corinthians 5:21 as the Word of God to support us
We may make such a statement based upon Colossians 2:9: 'In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily'
Through the Holy Spirit He received the divine essence, and through the human virgin He received the human essence
Mingling means that two elements are joined and mingled together, but the two elements do not lose their particular natures
Such a short definition helps us to be clear about the incarnation of Christ and His person in two natures with two kinds of life
After He passed through conception and birth, such a wonderful Christ lived on this earth for more than thirty-three years
After fully tasting the human life, He entered into and passed through an all-inclusive death with a number of aspects
Christ as the first item of the old creation brought also the entire old creation to the cross to be terminated
Christ died on the cross as the Peacemaker to abolish all the ordinances to make God's chosen people and redeemed ones one new man
Jesus was also anointed with this Holy Spirit to live and to minister to carry out a part of the New Testament ministry
The Spirit is the consummation of the processed God who has passed through incarnation, human living, death and resurrection
Based on His pleasure, He made a plan; He formed a purpose with His plan and chose a number of people and predestinated them unto sonship
We have spent much time to study the Greek word for economy or dispensation used in Ephesians 1:10; 3:9 and 1 Timothy 1:4-oikonomia
If you trace the root of this word, it goes back to a word that refers to the parceling out of food, the distributing of food as in parcels
Out of this economy many believers are being produced to be the components of the Body of God's Son for a full expression of the Triune God
Every point is fully and properly grounded in particular verses of the Bible, which you can find with the help of the Life-studies
If you do, wherever you go, you will speak concerning these things in a way that will stir up the interest of everyone you meet
Your speaking along these lines will stir up the interest of others, and there will be no end to their interest
What we need is for all of us to see God's New Testament ministry and to see the vision in the Lord's recovery today
The Lord's recovery has received a particular vision that is based upon the divine revelation concerning His New Testament ministry
We need to realize who Christ was at the very time He was condemned and put to death to suffer God's just and righteous judgment
Due to the heresy of Arius, not many Bible teachers would take this point in Colossians 1:15 according to the literal meaning of the Greek
According to history, Arius was condemned because of his heresy and cast out, even exiled, by the Nicene Council in A
Every Greek student, no need to say the Greek scholars, can recognize that this kind of translation is altogether inaccurate
Some teachers have even interpreted Christ being the Firstborn of all creation to mean merely that Christ was prior to all creation
The Docetists followed Gnosticism to say that all matter is evil, that every physical thing, including our flesh, is evil
If you count these four items you must admit that skin is something created and that bone flesh and blood are all something of the creatures
Hebrews 2:9 says clearly that Christ tasted death not only on behalf of every man but also on behalf of everything
In the same principle, He is the last Adam, the head of all mankind, and as such He is qualified to be the Redeemer of mankind
When John told us that the blood that cleanses us, or that redeems us, is the blood of Jesus, he added the title, 'His Son,' the Son of God
Of course God does not have blood to shed but even if He did have blood that He could shed that blood would not be qualified to redeem man
We need to see the essences, the constituents, of the being of this One who was crucified on the cross and whose name was Jesus Christ
He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a human virgin, with the divine essence mingled with the human essence
He is not merely human, but He is essentially both human and divine because He has been constituted with these two essences
When the Lord Jesus was baptized, He was baptized as One who possessed the divine essence and the human essence
Based upon this fact, Cerinthus taught his great heresy that Jesus Himself did not have the Holy Spirit, but He was only human
It might have been based upon this fact that Cerinthus taught that Jesus had nothing divine before the descending of the Holy Dove
When Jesus was crucified on the cross at the beginning of the last three hours at noon He cried out My God My God why have You forsaken Me
It may seem that Cerinthus could be right on this point, that he could have some ground for his interpretation of these verses
Before He was baptized and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, this One was divine already, constituted with the divine essence
In the same principle, for God to depart from Christ on the cross did not indicate that He was no longer constituted with the divine essence
It is correct to say that in the Trinity the First is the Father, the Second is the Son, and the Third is the Spirit
We need to see that the sequence of the Trinity is changed when it comes to the matter of the application to us
1 Peter 1:2 indicates that we were chosen by the Father through the sanctification of the Spirit according to the blood of Christ
In this case, the sequence is changed in the application to us with the Second becoming the First, and the First becoming the Second
In addition, as we have seen in the matter of the seven Spirits, the Spirit is essentially one, but economically seven
Because some early teachers discovered this principle, they invented terms such as the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity
In the essential Trinity, the Three are all there without anything that we might call a succession or a progression
In the economical Trinity, initially, the Father planned, He made His choice, His selection, and He predestinated
After the Son's accomplishment, the Spirit came to apply what the Son had accomplished according to what the Father had planned
When He accomplished redemption, economically speaking, there were some matters regarding the functioning Spirit
That descending of the Spirit was the functioning Spirit, the Spirit in function, or the Spirit in God's economy
At the last period of time on the cross, when He became sin in the eyes of God, this Spirit left Him economically, not essentially
He is qualified to accomplish our redemption, and the eternal and everlasting effectiveness of His redemption is insured
Because the Lord has shown us something in a much deeper way, we simply cannot follow the teachings that are superficial
It is not easy to speak concerning our vision of redemption, nor is it easy to speak concerning the vision of God's salvation
In the first stage of our vision concerning God's full salvation, we were enlightened to see the assurance of salvation
To be saved from environmental botherings is another matter and to be saved from Gods punishment from His discipline is still another matter
Even with such a list of items, there are many more things involved in God's salvation that we have not mentioned yet
When you try to explain what we have seen of God's full salvation, it is necessary for you to cover all of the aforementioned points
From this initial stage, God's compositional salvation goes on to save your soul by sanctification and transformation
These believers have been forgiven of their sins , which have been washed away by the redeeming blood of Christ
They have been justified by God in Christ , and they have been reconciled to God , so they have been redeemed back to God
These believers possess the divine life and partake of the divine nature in addition to their human life and human nature
They should walk according to the mingled spirit by the law of the Spirit of life that they might be freed from the law of sin and of death
Finally, they should be built up in the Body of Christ by the growth in life unto the full measure of the stature of Christ
After all the believers die, they go to Paradise , a pleasant section, a section of comfort, in Hades where the dead are kept
The living believers will remain until the Lord's coming back, which is His parousia, a Greek word meaning 'presence'
At the last rapture of the saints, all the dead ones will be resurrected and raptured with all the living saints to the air
Some Christian teachers think that the thousand years of the millennium as a dispensation is not for God's perfecting of His redeemed people
According to the vision we have seen, the coming one thousand years will still be a period of time in the old creation
As long as the time is still in the old creation, it will still be time for God to perfect His redeemed people
He perfected some in the first dispensation before law, such as Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph
God also used the second dispensation, the dispensation of law, to prepare people like Moses, Joshua, and Caleb
We must realize, though, that a good number of God's chosen ones were not perfected in the first dispensation before law
Surely God would not give up all of these unperfected believers who had been chosen and predestinated by Him in eternity
After Christ terminated the entire old creation through His all-inclusive death, the church was produced in His resurrection
In addition to seeing that the church was produced in Christ's resurrection, we must also see where the church is
Ephesians 2:6 tells us that the church has been resurrected with Christ, and now the church is seated in the heavenlies with Christ
Such a vision will govern you to the uttermost and will rule out everything that is not Christly , resurrectionly , or heavenly
With the believers there is still the flesh of sin, but with the church there is no flesh of sin because the church was born in resurrection
The Greek word for the church is ekklesia which means a calledout congregation a meeting a gathering or an assembly called out for a purpose
The Brethren teachers insisted on translating ekklesia in this way, so they were known as the Brethren assemblies
The church is God's ekklesia, which is composed of all the believers as a congregation called out of the world by God for His purpose
We must assemble and meet in order to have a congregation, a composition, for God to work and to move among us
We do not grow together separately like the trees in a forest, but we grow together organically like the members of a person's physical body
The church is the house of God , God's dwelling place, God's temple, which is in Christ, in resurrection, and in the heavenlies
Such a constitution, such a composition, becomes the fullness, the expression, of the One who fills all in all
The house, the Body, the fullness, the wife, and the warrior eventually are the very embodiment of the Triune God
The lampstand embodies the Triune God in His divine essence, in His divine shape, and for His divine expression
After being dealt with by the Lord during the millennium, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity
The Lord told Peter in Matthew 161819 that He would build His church upon the revelation of Christ which Peter had received from the Father
The first preaching of the New Testament gospel told people that they needed to repent because the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near
John the Baptist, Jesus, and the twelve apostles initiated the New Testament gospel by telling people that the kingdom had drawn near
The kingdom grows like a seed grows and the kingdom develops like a seed by its growing until it develops unto a harvest
Matthew 13 also shows us that the kingdom is like a seed sown into the human earth and that this seed grows in our heart to be the kingdom
The preposition among in Luke 17:21 where Jesus told the Pharisees that the kingdom of God was among them can also be translated into within
If a chicken or tiger wanted to enter into the human kingdom, they would have to be reborn, to be regenerated with the human life
By that time the Jewish people will repent and believe in Him and will receive this kingdom brought back by the Lord Jesus
The Acts shows us strongly that the Lord Jesus never gave up the kingdom and never put it aside to come to the matter of the church
Rather, after His resurrection He stayed with His disciples for forty days purposely to show them the kingdom of God
In our concept, we always consider that in the Acts the gospel was preached only for the purpose of producing and establishing the churches
Evangelize is the anglicized form of the Greek word euaggelizo, which means 'to preach something as the gospel'
In the Epistles, in 1 Corinthians , Galatians , Ephesians , and Colossians , the kingdom of God is referred to strongly
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
Romans 14 teaches us about the practical church life-how to receive the weaker believers without any kind of division
In Revelation 1:9, however, John did not say, 'I John, your brother in the church' but he said, 'I John, your brother
All the animals moving around in the zoo are an expression of the animal life and that expression is the animal kingdom
The expression of this divine life is the kingdom, the practicality of this life, and the practicality of this divine life is in the church
Matthew 5 through 7 is not a matter of morality or a high standard of ethics but the living of the divine life by the believers
The living of the divine life is the expression and the practicality of the divine life, so it is the kingdom in reality
In Matthew 132442 the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is revealed in the parable of the tares of the mustard seed and of the leaven
While this kingdom is going on on the earth, Satan endeavors to do everything to frustrate the growth and development of this kingdom
The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ-the unleavened fine flour-as its content, must be the unleavened bread
Even the seeking Christians today do not realize how much their mentality has been preoccupied already by the leavened truth
It should be an herb to produce the proper food for people, but Satan made it a tree to become a lodging for so many birds
Those who will enjoy the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens are those who are now living in the reality of the kingdom
The saved remnant of the Jews in the restored Davidic kingdom will be the priests teaching the nations to worship God
As a result, all these immature ones will be perfected in the fourth dispensation, and the perfection will not be so pleasant
That perfection will be a kind of discipline or punishment to force you to 'make up your lesson' to grow into maturity
The New Jerusalem is not only the conclusion to the entire Bible, but also the consummation of all the items in the Bible
From the entire divine revelation of the Bible we must infer logically that the New Jerusalem surely could never be a physical lodging place
In Revelation 12:1 the universal woman crowned with twelve stars, clothed with the sun, and standing on the moon is a great sign
Twelve thousand stadia is about thirteen hundred and fifty miles, the approximate distance from New York to Dallas
If this is a real city to lodge in, we must ask how all God's redeemed through all the centuries will be able to lodge there
If you say that the last sign, the New Jerusalem, is a physical, real city, then what about the lampstands as the first sign in this book?
One city is a sign of the false church and the other city, the holy city, signifies the ultimate consummation of the pure church
In the Old Testament God told His redeemed people Israel that He was their husband and that they were His wife
When the Lord Jesus came, John the Baptist told his disciples that Christ was the bridegroom coming to take the bride which is the church
The New Jerusalem is the consummation of God's counterpart, the aggregate of all His redeemed and perfected people
In Revelation 22:3 we are told that all the redeemed and perfected saints in eternity will be God's serving ones
Again, we must realize what a wrong concept it is to say that the New Jerusalem is a great physical mansion for God's children to lodge in
He dwells in us and we dwell in Him and this mutual dwelling is the New Jerusalem which to God is the tabernacle and to us is the temple
In the New Testament, firstly the Lord Jesus was the tabernacle in John 1:14 and He was also the temple in John 2:19-22
In John 2 He indicated that in His resurrection this temple would be enlarged to be a corporate temple, which is the church
We see in the Old Testament that Abraham was looking for a city and that his descendants, the children of Israel, built a tabernacle
Even Peter rebuked the Jews by saying that they, the builders, had rejected Christ as the cornerstone of God's building
We can see that God's building is a line throughout the entire Bible, and the consummation of this building is the New Jerusalem
The great Triune God with all of His achievements and workings throughout the ages surely needs a marvelous consummation
These six reasons show us that the New Jerusalem could not be a physical mansion or a physical city for God's redeemed people to lodge in
The consummation is a living composition of all God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people
The divine life with God the Father is the light, with God the Son is the tree, and with God the Spirit is the river
We will serve Him and He will be served by us, and this will be the eternal kingdom, the eternal realm of the divine life
Also, if we are going to understand the names of the twelve apostles we need to understand the entire New Testament
These twenty-four names on this composition are a part of the ultimate consummation of the things in the Bible
The names of the twelve tribes on the twelve gates indicate that the history of the twelve tribes is a kind of entering
The law, which comprises a major part of the Old Testament, is considered by Paul as a child-conductor which conducted us to Christ
The twelve tribes conducted us to Christ, the One who produces the pearl through His death and through His resurrection
Pauls thought in Galatians 3 was that after the law conducted Gods chosen people to Christ Christs death stopped the law by fulfilling it
The twelve gates of twelve pearls bearing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel signify the ultimate consummation of the Old Testament
Whatever was there in the Old Testament was a kind of conducting, a kind of entry, but whatever is in the New Testament is a foundation
The Old Testament was a conducting to the gates and the New Testament is a foundation for this ultimate consummation
The 'three gates' on each side signify that the Triune God-Father, Son, and Spirit-work together to bring people into the holy city
The street of gold signifies that the Fathers nature is our way our street our route for our traffic for our fellowship and for our move
The river of water of life proceeds in the middle of this street and the tree of life grows on the two sides of the river
The Son is the tree of life so the tree of life signifies the Son's being, which is the food of God's redeemed people
Out of the very God and the very Lamb who sit on the throne flows the river of water of life which signifies the Spirit as the Regenerator
You have read Revelation 21 and 22 again and again in a superficial way, which is the general practice of many Christians
We can preach the gospel with all these items to the sinners to show them what the ultimate consummation of God's salvation is
They will be regenerated and their regeneration will be the entrance into this wonderful, bountiful, marvelous enjoyment
After hearing this, some dissenters who have some biblical knowledge in a traditional way may refer you to Hebrews 11
The dissenters would argue that Abraham was waiting for a city, considering himself to have no land and no place
They may quote verse 14 which says, 'For those who say such things make it manifest that they seek a country of their own'
If he says this he has lost his case already because you can tell him that the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven
The rest of verse 16 says, 'Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them'
The Son came through incarnation, lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, and was resurrected and ascended
Eventually, do you believe that as a conclusion God would merely build a physical city for His redeemed people to live in?
Psalm 90 which is a psalm of Moses, the man of God, tells us, 'O Lord, You havet been our dwelling place / In all generations'
Even the Old Testament saints considered God as their dwelling place and they desired to dwell in this place to behold God all the time
If we would get ourselves into this matter, then we would be able to preach, teach, and present this matter to anyone
Year after year there should be new material-every page of the book of Revelation can be used as material for gospel preaching
The sons are in the city drinking the river of life, eating the tree of life, and walking in the light of life
The middle class of people do not suffer the burning, nor do they enjoy the tree of life, the river of life, or the light of life
In their general concept there will be only two categories of people, the saved ones and the perished ones, in eternity
The only problem with this hymn is that this word was not spoken to the believers but to the peoples on the new earth outside the holy city
For God to wipe away tears with no sorrow or crying or pain are the blessings outside the city without eternal life
The fact that this hymn made it into our supplement shows that with just a little carelessness something is able to creep in
In addition, the Lord charged the church in Laodicea to buy from Him gold refined by fire that they might be rich
These are just some of the verses we need to study in order to see the significance of the consummation of gold in the New Jerusalem
Many of you young brothers have consecrated yourselves to the Lord with your whole life, not only your whole time
To serve the Lord is to minister the Lord the Triune God as everything from within the revelation of the holy Word with all the basic truths
How could we serve the Lord without the capital of the adequate knowledge and experience of the divine truths?
We have just finished the Life-study of the entire New Testament and most of these messages have been published
You must study the gold in the Bible from Genesis 2 through Revelation 21 to fully understand the gold in its ultimate consummation
The city proper is like a mountain with a height of twelve thousand stadia and the city is pure gold, like pure glass
After such study then you would know the ultimate consummation of the significance of gold used as a divine figure in the Bible
When the oyster gets wounded by a particle of sand it secretes its life-juice around the sand, making it a pearl
These twelve stones as the wall and the foundation of this ultimate consummation must bear a great significance
In addition to studying by using the lexicons and other Bible-study helps, it would help to get the stones themselves
There are many more things to say concerning the book of Revelation, and we may need an entire year with two trainings to do an adequate job
Chapters six through twenty of Revelation are actually a parenthetical section because Revelation is a book on the church
The last enemy, death, will be dealt with along with Satan, who held it as might and who is cast into the lake of fire
Revelation six through twenty is, therefore, a section on God's universal government to deal with His enemy and all the negative things
The firstfruit of the believers before the great tribulation, the one hundred and forty-four thousand, is in 14:1-5
To come out of her means to come out of both religious Babylon and material Babylon since Babylon the Great is twofold
If we would study these instances we would see something and have something new, solid, and basic to minister to the churches
If we would study these instances, we would understand much more concerning God's economy related to the church and the saints
You young brothers are in a golden time because you have many years to study these precious things if the Lord delays His coming
Onyx is the very first stone mentioned in the Bible and one of the last stones mentioned in the Bible is jasper
You also must study the twelve stones on the breastplate of Urim and Thummim and the stones on the shoulders of the high priest
Many marvelous mines in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament have been opened up in these last ten years
Finally, in Revelation 22:1 we see a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb
It is the harvest of all the seeds of the divine truth which have been sown and grown up throughout the Scriptures
In the New Testament the Lord Jesus says that if we drink of Him we will have rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being
In Revelation chapter seven we see that the Lamb shepherds the saints and guides them to springs of waters of life
Even Paul was charged by the Lord to preach the gospel to open peoples' eyes and to turn them from darkness to light
We have also seen that the tree of life the river of life and the light of life are the consummation of the divine life throughout the Bible
The Son's redeeming, the Spirit's seeking, and the Father's receiving are a complete entrance into the New Jerusalem
The New Testament tells us four main things concerning what God is: God is Spirit , God is life , God is love , and God is light
Expressions such as God is light, God is love , and God is Spirit are not used in a metaphoric sense but in a predicative sense
Spirit denotes the nature of God's person; love, the nature of God's essence; and light, the nature of God's expression
When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines on us, it becomes truth
As a result, you are short of feelings, short of thoughts, short of words, short of points, and short of expression
We could preach four or five messages out of this one note for our gospel preaching, telling people that our God is not like the idols
Many of us preach from the traditional concept that God loves the world and that the sinners are going to hell
It is true that God loves us but there is nothing fresh, nothing new and nothing interesting in this for people
You not only tell people that God loves them but you also need to tell them that God is love, which is the nature of His essence
We will preach something intrinsically essential and we will be teaching the basic revelation in the Holy Scriptures
The vision that the Lord has given us in His recovery is following the New Testament ministry; it is not following traditional theology
In theology would not be able to tell you what it means to say that God is Spirit, God is love, God is light, and God is life
One message which is not in the central lane of the New Testament ministry wastes a lot of energy and a lot of time for the saints
We must consider whether this material would take the saints on speedily or would hold them back, distract them, or mislead them
We are living at the end of the twentieth century and the Lord's recovery has passed through so many centuries already
Peter later wrote in his first Epistle that the Lord Himself is a living stone and that we believers are also living stones
The holy city, therefore, as the consummation of God's building in the Bible, is not something physical but personal
We must also ask ourselves whether or not in the entire universe God has a physical building and He is also now building a personal building
According to the traditional teaching in John 14, the Lord has gone back to the heavens to build a physical, heavenly mansion
Today the Lord in His heavenly ministry is building a physical building in the heavens and a spiritual building on earth
If there is a physical city at the end of the Bible, though, we must ask where the spiritual building built by the Lord is
A strange point about this kind of interpretation is that the physical building is in the heavens and the spiritual building is on the earth
The word given in John 14, which some people interpret as the Lord going to prepare 'a heavenly mansion,' was spoken two thousand years ago
Since such is the principle in God's creation, why has it taken nearly two thousand years to build such a big physical house in the heavens?
The New Testament principle, being eternal, will exist forever going through the millennium and on into eternity
Such a principle along with our logical consideration would not allow us to interpret the New Jerusalem as a physical city
Based upon this kind of understanding, let us read some more verses in the book of Hebrews concerning the New Jerusalem
We, the New Testament believers, have not come to these physical things-a physical Mount Sinai, the sound of a trumpet and a physical voice
Hebrews 12:23 also tells us that we have come 'to God, the Judge of all; and to the spirits of righteous men who have been made perfect'
The things mentioned in verses 22-24 are heavenly or spiritual, in contrast with the earthly and physical things listed in verses 18-19
Hebrews 11:14-16 says that Abraham and other Old Testament saints were expecting, were waiting, for a better country with a marvelous city
Some Christian teachers taught us that when the Lord resurrected from Hades, He brought the entire paradise to the third heavens
According to this kind of teaching Abraham should have entered into heaven entered into the better country and to the city that he expected
At this point, we must read Hebrews 11:39: 'And these all, having obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not obtain the promise'
Some might say that this means Abraham entered into the country in the heavens but that the good city has not been completed
Both the participation in the kingdom for one thousand years and the sharing in the New Jerusalem for eternity are corporate matters
What we will enjoy together are not physical things, but we will enjoy the Triune God wrought into His chosen people in at least five ways
The Triune God is His redeemed people's entry into the divine composition as the three gates on the four sides of the city
Abraham was waiting for such a blessing even though by that time he probably did not understand the fullness of such a blessing
In the same way, today we have received eternal life but we do not understand what is involved in the blessing of the eternal life
In the third stage it is not to receive nor to inherit the eternal life but to enjoy the eternal life in its consummation
To have the Lord wipe away our tears and the taking away of sorrows, crying, and pain is all according to our natural understanding
In Revelation 21:7, though, it indicates that God's sons will participate in the New Jerusalem with all its enjoyment
We must study based upon the last one and a half chapters in the Bible-Revelation 21 and the first half of Revelation 22
Also, the books that we have written and published over the years will help you study this portion of the word
It is the ultimate consummation of the eternal life which we have received and are still living by in its fullest blessing
The second age, the age of the millennium, is the age for us to inherit the blessings of this eternal life in full as a kingdom
Eternity will be the age for us to enjoy the ultimate consummation of all the blessings of this eternal life to the fullest
We must remember that our God in His Trinity, with all His plan, economy, and achievements, has been wrought into this city
That means our God in His Trinity with everything He has done and achieved has been wrought into our intrinsic being
The only difference is that today we are in the process and in that day of the New Jerusalem it will be the consummation
The process to reach the consummation and the consummation itself are exactly the same in principle and in nature
Now this Hagar is Sinai the mountain in Arabia and corresponds to the Jerusalem which now is, for she is in slavery with her children
The physical Jerusalem represents the law which produces children unto slavery, but the Jerusalem which is above is free who is our mother
In this grace are the Triune God His plan His economy His redemption His salvation and all His achievements wrought into His chosen people
We belong to this divine yet human composition saturated, even constituted, with God's grace which produces us all
To understand John 14 through 16 plus chapter seventeen as a prayer, we need to know how the entire Gospel of John is arranged
To know any point, especially a serious point in the Bible, we must take care of the entire book in which it is located
They give us a clear view of how this life which Christ imparts into people meets the need of every man's case
At that juncture, Jesus entered into Jerusalem in a lowly and humble way, yet the people gave Him the top welcome
From John 12:20 to the end of chapter seventeen is a separate section which could be titled: 'The Way of Jesus' Glorification'
In the Gospel of John, the glorification of Jesus is a major point to which many readers and Bible teachers have not paid adequate attention
These then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus
After chapter seventeen, He was betrayed, arrested, judged and sentenced to death, crucified, buried, and resurrected
In resurrection and on the day of resurrection, He came back to His disciples not in the natural way but in the resurrected way
When the life within it is released to bear much fruit, the many grains become the glorification of the one grain
To die and to grow up in resurrection was the way for Jesus as the one grain with the divine life concealed in His humanity to be glorified
The Lord was asking the Father to glorify His person, because the very divine person of the Father had been concealed in His humanity
After Jesus prayed, 'Father, glorify Your name,' there came a voice out of heaven, 'I have both glorified it and will glorify it again'
The Lord's death and His resurrection would produce much fruit, and this fruit would be the many men drawn to Christ by His wonderful death
When He died, all men would be drawn to Him and these men drawn to Him would be the very fruit produced by Him in resurrection
John 13:31-32 says, 'Then when he went out, Jesus said, Now has the Son of Man been glorified, and God has been glorified in Him
At the feast of the Passover the Lord Jesus exposed Judas and indicated to Peter and John that Judas was the one who was going to betray Him
While the Lord Jesus was setting up His table Judas was carrying out his betrayal to bring those Jewish opposers to the garden of Gethsemane
He was expanded, enlarged, multiplied, in His death and resurrection, and that multiplication was His glorification
After this the Lord went to the garden of Gethsemane according to the record of the synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke
After the Lord spoke that long discourse in chapters fourteen through sixteen, He prayed a prayer in chapter seventeen
The issue of Jesus being glorified is that His believers will be brought into the Triune God, into the divine 'Us'
The Lord says that He will receive the believers not to heaven but to Himself that where He is they also may be
He said this at the beginning of chapter fourteen in verse 3, and He prayed about this at the end of chapter seventeen in verse 24
It becomes many grains which are the multiplication of the one grain; this is the real expansion of Jesus to be His mystical Body
His glorification is His multiplication and His multiplication is His expansion from one person to a corporate Body
In 14:3 we can see what the Lord Jesus means by saying that He was going and that while He was going, He was coming
He brought forth many believers which are the many grains who are the members of His Body, which is God's house
According to the context of the sections of the Gospel of John, the Father's house must be interpreted in this way
To interpret it in another way would be according to the natural, religious concept and according to the traditional teaching
Do you not have the Triune God, the Creator, the Redeemer, and the Regenerator, as the source of your existence?
The very oneness in chapter seventeen equals the newborn child, which equals the vine tree, which equals the house
The traditional Christian understanding is that Jesus as the Son of God was sent by the Father and died on the cross for our sins
When the believers die they go to the place which the Lord Jesus promised that He was going to prepare in John 14
Traditional theology and the New Testament ministry are absolutely in two different realms, in two kingdoms with two lives
If you desire to go further and deeper into these mysterious truths, you must spend much time and much energy and pray much
As we have seen, John 14 through 17 is a section of the word on the multiplication of Jesus, that is, the glorification
If we interpret 'My Father's house' in John 14:2 as a physical mansion in the heavens, where would it belong in this section?
We all must hold such an attitude with such a spirit that we are not the center, the flow, the line, the goal, but the Lord, the Spirit, is
We are merely a group of Christians coming together to pray, but seemingly not something in the Lord's recovery
Do you believe that when the one hundred twenty met together in Jerusalem in Acts 1 that they prayed in our way?
We must learn to forget all the things we have, all the things we know, and even all the things we have heard recently
Let us come together to pray with an open spirit with nothing occupying us; just come to the prayer meeting in an empty way
We should come to the prayer meeting with our whole being on the altar so the Lord can operate within us and even expose us
We should come to the prayer meeting with the attitude that we do not know anything but that we only know the Lord Himself
If you would open up your mouth and speak two or three sentences from within in this way, the entire heaven would be open
You prayed and the Spirit did not lead you to pray; you did not pray and the Spirit did not lead you not to pray
In God's wisdom, He put all these items together in a consummating book; this is the last book, the sixty-sixth book of the Bible
Everything that was sown in the book of Genesis began to grow from the second book Exodus throughout the next sixtyfour books of the Bible
The sixty-sixth book, Revelation, the last book of the entire Bible, is there as a harvest of the truths which were sown in Genesis
All the consummations in Revelation are a consummation concerning Christ, concerning the Spirit, concerning life, and concerning the church
Many things in the Old Testament are consummated in Revelation which are seemingly not related to Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church
As we have seen, chapters four through twenty of Revelation are on God's universal, governmental administration
Seemingly, God's governmental administration has nothing to do with the church, but it is indirectly related to the church
Him who is, who was, and who is coming brings us back to the beginning of the divine revelation concerning the Divine Trinity
In Exodus 25:31-38 and in Zechariah 4:2 the lampstand was in the tabernacle and in 1 Kings 7:49 the lampstand was in the temple
The priest in the Old Testament had a three-fold duty-to offer the sacrifices, to trim the lamps of the lampstands, and to burn the incense
The house of God is a spot where a ladder joins the earth to the heavens and brings the heavens down to the earth
God promised Abraham that He would multiply his seed as the stars of the heaven and also as the sand which is upon the seashore
Throughout the centuries there have been many Balaams who distracted God's people and many Jezebels who mislead God's people
In Revelation 2:17 we also see the hidden manna, which again is only for a restricted number of people-the overcomers
The 'Star out of Jacob' and the star appearing at the Lord's birth consummates in the morning star in Revelation 2:28
We also need to study the pillars in the church in Galatians 2:9 and the church being the pillar of the truth in 1 Timothy 3:15
He saw a little concerning the throne and Ezekiel saw more, but neither of them saw as much as John did in Revelation
Seventeen chapters in the book of Revelation give us a record of this throne, from chapter four through chapter twenty
To understand the Lamb and its consummation in Revelation, it is necessary to go back to all the books of the Bible to see the Lamb
There we see the Lamb as the one who holds God within Him as light because the Lamb is the lamp and God is the light in the lamp
The souls of the martyrs underneath the altar indicate that they were sacrifices offered to God on the altar for God's satisfaction
In Revelation 8 we see Christ as the Priest burning the incense with the fire from the altar of burnt offering
As we have seen, the incense altar, undoubtedly, was in the heavenly tabernacle, but where is the altar on this earth?
In the previous chapter we ended with the brass altar the altar of the offerings and the golden altar the altar of incense in Revelation 8
We must say that there is a temple in the heavens because John saw it, and in that temple was the ark of testimony
Now we must ask whether or not there was a tabernacle in the heavens and a temple in the heavens at the same time
The tabernacle existed as a precursor to the temple, and the temple stood as a fulfillment of the tabernacle or a replacement
Why then does the Bible tell us that in the New Testament there is the heavenly tabernacle and also the temple in heaven?
The reflexive pronoun itself is inserted to strengthen the thought that the heavenly tabernacle is heaven itself
Hebrews 9:1 says, 'Now then the first covenant also had ordinances of service, and its sanctuary was of this world'
The translators of the Chinese version of the Bible translated heaven itself in Hebrews 9:24 into heavenly mansion
The Chinese version of the Bible in these verses has actually brought in a Buddhistic thought with a Buddhistic term
Now we must read Revelation 11:19: 'And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant was seen in His temple'
From chapter twelve the center of God's government is no longer the throne but the temple with the Testimony, the Ark
We also see in Revelation 21:10 that the New Jerusalem, considered by some others as the heavenly mansion, comes down out of heaven
Many Christians might say that this is the heavenly mansion, God's dwelling place, which descends out of heaven in Revelation 21:10
We must remember, though, that the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the tabernacle and of the temple in the Bible
In Revelation 21, though, the tabernacle as the New Jerusalem is without the temple because God and the Lamb Himself are the temple
According to this interpretation the New Jerusalem is a physical dwelling place to God, just as the temple in heaven is
These complications, though, indicate that the New Jerusalem is neither the heavenly tabernacle nor the temple in heaven
We know from history that the temple in the Old Testament was destroyed, but the Bible does not tell us where the temple in heaven will go
The New Jerusalem cannot be the temple in heaven in Revelation 11:19 and 15:5 because in the New Jerusalem John saw no temple
By this we can see that the New Jerusalem was not the tabernacle and the temple of the Old Testament on the earth
When the New Jerusalem came, John said he saw no temple in it because now the temple is God and the Lamb Himself
It is neither the ultimate consummation of the set on earth in the Old Testament, nor of the set in the heavens in the New Testament
In the universe, before Moses, God had a dwelling place in heaven, and heaven, according to Hebrews 9:24, was God's tabernacle
When God charged Moses to build the tabernacle, He charged him to build it according to God's heavenly pattern
The Old Testament tabernacle and temple was an earthly copy of the heavenly tabernacle and the temple in heaven
We must realize that this ultimate consummation has been leavened and has been changed in every way in its intrinsic essence and element
The house in John and the city in Revelation must be brought back to their rightful position in God's New Testament economy
Both are the very illustration of the Triune God working Himself into our being to be the house and to be the city
The ultimate consummation of the Triune God dispensing Himself into our being is this holy city, the New Jerusalem
Concerning this universal woman, it is necessary to study the positive females in the Old Testament beginning from Eve
Also, even in the Old Testament God considered His chosen people as a female and furthermore as His counterpart, His wife
In Revelation 13:1-2 is the coming beast 'out of the sea,' signifying the coming Caesar of the coming Roman Empire
Also, in Revelation 13 is another beast 'out of the earth' who 'had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon'
To fully understand this consummation it is necessary to study Leviticus 23:9-14, a record of the feast of the firstfruits
In Revelation 15:2 is the glassy sea, which is a consummation of all the different baptisms in the Old and New Testaments
In the temple in 1 Kings 7 this laver became a great molten sea standing upon twelve oxen and accompanied with some small lavers
To understand this consummation you must study Babel in Genesis 11:1-9 and you must study the history of Babylon in the Old Testament
The heavenly army is an ultimate consummation of all the people who have been fighting for God's interests through the generations
The earthly part of the millennium includes the kingdom of the Messiah , the tabernacle of David , the kingdom of the Son of Man
In this city we also see pearls, which are the consummation of the bdellium in Genesis 2:12 and of the pearl in Matthew 13:45-46
The Divine Trinity is revealed in these chapters, not in a doctrinal way, but in a way of being wrought into the believers in Christ
In Revelation 22 the Bridegroom is the Spirit, who in chapters two and three was the Spirit speaking to the churches
We must see all these things because we have been covered, veiled, leavened, distracted, held back, misled, delayed, and frustrated
We need such a strong vision to take away the veil, to purge out the leaven, and to bring us back to the central lane
We all will be like the early apostles who did not minister anything but this one, unique, New Testament economy
Paul taught something concerning head covering , but he did it in the scope of the dispensing of the Triune God
Our ministry is not to get a crowd; it is not to get a market for our work; it is not to stir up people's interest
You all can testify that once you touch the publication of the Lord's New Testament ministry, you can sense a particular flavor
Even though this is fully revealed in Revelation 21 and has clear subtitles in the Recovery Version, no one had this kind of realization
Do not think that just because you have been under this training for years that you have gotten to know everything
Again, this is a strong proof that we have not been brought into the real realization of the New Testament ministry
Based upon the King James rendering, many believe that the Lord has gone to prepare a heavenly mansion in the heavens
If this is the case, then as long as the Lord is not here yet, this indicates that the heavenly mansion has not yet been completed
John 14:3 does not say that the believers go to the Lord, but it says that the Lord will come back to receive them to Himself
Another portion of the Scriptures also tells us that at the Lord's coming back 'the dead in Christ will rise first
We who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air'
Darby, in his Synopsis of the Books of the Bible, told people that the Lord was going to prepare a place and that we all would go there
We can see from this that Darby, who was called the king of the expositors, was also wrong in his interpretation of John 14:2-3
The definition of the word fatness according to the Hebrew dictionary of the Strong's Concordance is very interesting and meaningful
Strong's says that figuratively speaking fatness means 'abundance' and specifically refers to the fatty ashes of sacrifices
All of the offerings are types of Christ and the fatty ashes of these offerings are the signs of His accomplishment
If they would relate this context to these verses it would take away their traditional human natural religious and superstitious mentality
In the ultimate consummation we see exactly the same thing-the fatness, the river, and the fountain of life and light
Even in the dispensation of law before the dispensation of the New Testament age, the seeking saints were enjoying the Triune God
They did not need to go to the heavens to enjoy Him, but they could and did enjoy the Triune God in His dwelling place on this earth
If there is no fatness of Christ, no flowing river of the Spirit, and no fountain of life and light, that is not the proper church
Some of you have been reading studying and reciting Psalm 3689 for years but you could not and did not interpret these verses in this way
Without such a vision you may present a good message based upon Psalm 3689 yet it will be so shallow touching nothing of the Divine Trinity
When you see the word sacrifices, you would be so clear that this refers to the second of the Divine Trinity, Christ
Romans 14:17 refers back to this river when it tells us that the kingdom of God is 'righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
The joy in the Holy Spirit is the river of pleasures, or we could say the river of pleasures is the Spirit of joy
It will be full of the fatness, full of the flowing of the river of pleasures, and full of the fountain of life and of light
He was not in the law, but he was in the house enjoying the fatness, the river of pleasures, and the fountain of life and light
To drink the river of God's pleasures is one thing and to be planted by the side of the river is another thing
The conclusion of Psalm 2 is that all they that put their trust in Christ are blessed, and that we should 'kiss the Son, / Lest He be angry'
Again, our basis of interpretation is the principle of the vision of the Triune God being wrought into our being
If you are not possessed and captured by this vision sooner or later your preaching your teaching and your messages will be somewhat natural
You will have no ability to discern what portion of the Bible is religious and what portion of the Bible is of life
In Luke 15 Christ is first as the Shepherd , the Spirit is second as the seeking woman , and the Father is third
Every message is a different way of cooking the same thing-the Triune God being wrought into His redeemed people
The biblical way is this way-the Triune God is 'cooked' in different ways from the first page of Genesis to the last page of Revelation
We can discern whether or not someone else's teaching and ministering is holding people back or frustrating and distracting them
A certain message may be wonderful, eloquent, and very inspiring, yet in principle that may be a distracting message, a holding back message
Only this serves God's purpose, only this keeps us from being led astray, and only this can keep us in oneness from today through eternity
In 1 Corinthians Paul charged the believers to speak the same thing and in Philippians he charged them to think the same thing
Philippians is a book on the Triune God-specifically on Christ and specifically on the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Because we are a person in Christ, our speaking is the speaking in Christ and our message is a message in Christ
