   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BASIS OF OUR DOCTRINE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have said that Christianity does not emphasize doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, it emphasizes the person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even when some doctrines are mentioned, they are few in number, and when you go about expounding them, they always point back to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you turn to the four Gospels you will be amazed to find that everything recorded is just a description of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There must first be the knowledge of who He is; doctrines come afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have ascertained the person of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we want to take a look at the doctrines of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>COMPARISONS IN DOCTRINES</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You cannot find many doctrines in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Neither are there many doctrines in the Acts of the Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One finds doctrines only after coming to Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is exactly what we have said before, that you have to know who Jesus Christ is before you can understand what His doctrines are all about.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning doctrines, there is also a vast difference between those in Christianity and those in other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I would like to mention again that the fact that I am a Christian does not mean that you have to feel and see things as I do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I will not take such a presumptuous attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I will only present the facts again, showing the difference between Christianity and other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I will not decide what is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You are asked only to examine the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you think that this is right, then believe in it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Otherwise, take your choice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Emotional words are unnecessary here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I will, therefore, make no plea or invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Observing all the religions that are before us, you will see that all of them emphasize doctrines, not a person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether Confucius or Lao-tze, who they are and what they teach are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are two separate entities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their doctrines do not have much to do with their person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You can take the person away from the religion, and it will not make much difference.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The person only preached the doctrines, but he became disassociated from that which he preached.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not the case with our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When did Christian doctrines come into existence?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was after the death, resurrection, and departure from the world of the person Christ that the doctrines began.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All doctrines came later.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, all these doctrines are centered upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The doctrines and Christ are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First you have Him, then you have His doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE UNION OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, there is a doctrine in Christianity that speaks of the union of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a very important doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you open the Bible to see how this can be, you will see that the source of such a doctrine is the fact that God became a man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible does not present a doctrine of God becoming one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, it shows Jesus of Nazareth, who is a sample of God being one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Originally, God and man were separate; there was a wide gulf between them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There was no possibility of union.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Nazarene came.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was God coming to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was the bridge between man and God, joining the two into one.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not a doctrine that teaches people to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here is the fact: henceforth, when a man is in Christ, he can be one with God.</S>
