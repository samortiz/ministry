<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SATISFYING GOD&rsquo;S NEED</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 14:17</h1>
<p>God has a need in the universe. God does not need man to give Him something, because with Him there is no lack. God needs only a group of people who would consecrate themselves as empty vessels to receive His riches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSECRATION BEING A GAIN, NOT A LOSS</h2>
<p>Consecration is not a sacrifice or a loss but a gain and an enjoyment. Consecration does not mean that we agree to do something for God but that we agree to allow God to do something for us. Consecration means that we cease to work and instead allow God to work. Because we are filled with concepts related to the law, we think that we must do something for God, be zealous for God, or accumulate some merit before God. This thought does not come from God. This is the principle of the law, not the principle of grace. Everything that God gives to us is free. In the kingdom of God there are no commercial transactions; everything is freely given and freely received. However, in Satan&rsquo;s kingdom everything is a commercial transaction; that is, something must be given in order for something to be received. God does not deal with us in this way. If God did not provide us with sunlight, for example, there is nothing that we could give Him in order to receive sunlight. Without God not one blade of grass or one flower would grow, no matter how much money we could give Him.</p>
<p>It offends God when we try to conduct a &ldquo;business transaction&rdquo; with Him. How much money is one breath of air or one drop of water worth? Some may say, &ldquo;It is easy to determine the value of water because every month I pay a small water fee, and I also buy water for drinking and laundering.&rdquo; It may seem as if we were buying water, but we are actually buying a service from the water company; the water itself has been freely given to us by God. If God did not provide us with water, there would be no amount of money that we could pay to a water company in order to obtain even a drop of water. Everything in creation has been freely given to us by God. Just as everything in creation is free, everything related to redemption is also free. Whatever has not been freely given to us by God is not grace. Consecration does not involve us giving something to God; it involves us stopping our work so that God can do His work. If we see this, it will be a great turning point in our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSECRATED ONES<br />
BEING FULL OF JOY AND AT REST</h2>
<p>Many of us work in different places and on different jobs. Do we have a sense of joy when we are at work? Do we have a sense of rest? If we are a consecrated person, we will surely be full of joy and rest. A brother testified that when he consecrated himself to the Lord in prayer, he was so happy that he wanted to jump. The more he prayed, the happier he became. He said that he felt a sense of joy throughout his body. It even seemed to him as if his feet were happy and smiling. After consecration God gives us boundless joy.</p>
<p>Psalm 42:5 says, &ldquo;Why are you cast down, O my soul? / And why are you disquieted within me? / Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him / For the salvation of His countenance.&rdquo; The psalmist exhorted his soul to hope in God, for he saw the salvation of God&rsquo;s countenance. Verse 11 continues, &ldquo;Hope in God, for I will yet praise Him, / The salvation of my countenance and my God.&rdquo; Joy is a manifestation of God&rsquo;s salvation in our countenance. Do we express salvation in our countenance? Many people have a long face when they rise up in the morning, a face lacking in salvation. Such a face is not the face of a consecrated one.</p>
<p>One day a sister from a poor family was riding on a bus. As she thought about the Lord, she became so joyful that she could not sit still. The other passengers on the bus looked at her with curious eyes because they could not reconcile her obvious joy with her situation of poverty. The conductor even said sarcastically, &ldquo;You look like you are going to receive an inheritance from a rich man who has died.&rdquo; Instead of getting angry, the sister said, &ldquo;Yes! My Lord died for me, and He has given to me a heavenly inheritance.&rdquo; Because she knew the Lord, she expressed the Lord&rsquo;s salvation in her countenance everywhere she went.</p>
<p>If we do not express salvation in our countenance, it means that we are not standing in the position of consecration. If we do not have joy and happiness in our daily life, we have not yet been brought into the Lord to enjoy His riches. Consecration is a great turning point in a believer&rsquo;s life; it is also the turning point in our work. Every Christian should go through the gateway of consecration.</p>
