   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Entrance of the Word Giving Light</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 119:130 the psalmist says, The entrance of thy words giveth light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Word has an entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that the Bible has an opening, a gate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to my experience, the bar to this gate is not on the inside, but on the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is on our side of the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that if the gate is closed, we are the ones who have closed it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether the Word is open to us or not depends on how we deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes we pray that the Lord would open the Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, when we pray in this way, the Lord may tell us that, on His side, He has already opened His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we, on our side, need to open the gate of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our experience testifies that if we have no problems with the Lord when we come to the Word, the Word will be open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we come to the Word when we have problems with the Lord, the door will be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the bar to the gate is on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we come to the Word and open it, then in our spiritual experience, the Word will have an entrance, an opening.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I wish to emphasize the fact that whether the gate of the Word is open or closed depends on us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to thank the Lord that the Word has an entrance, a gate, and that the bar of the gate is on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should say, Lord, thank You for the entrance, the opening, to Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Often in our experience we sense that, because we come to the Word in the right way, the Word has an opening.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This opening seems to depend on the Lord and come from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, it actually depends on us and comes from approaching the Word in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Lamp unto Our Feet</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 105 the psalmist says a practical word about light: Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not a matter of doctrine or teaching, but of experience in the daily life of the psalmist.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Step after step in his daily life, the Word was his light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In ancient times, there were, of course, no street lights.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who traveled at night needed a lamp, lantern, or torch to light their way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what the psalmist has in mind when he refers to the Word as a lamp unto his feet and a light unto his path.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Word was a lamp that enlightened his footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a very practical way, to the psalmist the Word of God was such a lamp casting light on his pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Enlightening the Eyes</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Psalm 19:8b says, The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse indicates that God s living Word enlightens our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not sense that we are in light when we come to the Word, this is a sign that our condition is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not adequate simply to pray that the Lord will give us light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to humble ourselves, have a thorough dealing with the Lord, and ask Him to have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The knowledge many Christians gain from reading the Bible actually becomes a veil or covering that keeps them in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who have such a knowledge of the Scriptures need to humble themselves before the Lord so that the coverings may be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we humble ourselves and receive the Lord s mercy, the Bible will no longer be mere knowledge to us it will be light to our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is important to differentiate between knowledge and light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may have the Bible just in the way of knowledge, or in our experience the Word may be the shining of the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>RECEIVING THE SUPPLY OF LIFE THROUGH THE WORD Light Becoming Life</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The loving seekers of God also receive the life supply, the enlivening, the quickening, through His living Word 119:25, 50 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In our spiritual experience we first have light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But then the light must become life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Life is deeper than light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever light comes, life should come also.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In fact, life is the container of light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John 1:4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is difficult to determine which comes first, life or light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a rule, light comes before life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to Genesis 1, we first have light, then the various aspects of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In our experience it is possible to have light without life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Light is mainly in the realm of the soul, especially in the sphere of the understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Life, to be sure, is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although it is good to have light, the light must penetrate deeper until it becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have pointed out that if our condition is proper or normal when we come to the Word, we have the sense that we are in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whatever we read in the Bible thus becomes light to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then as we exercise ourselves to pray, we shall spontaneously exercise our spirit and go deeper into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through this exercise of spirit in prayer, the light will enter into our spirit and become life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In our understanding in the realm of the soul, the Word is light, but when the Word goes deeper, into our spirit, it becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our experience indicates that the life supply does not come before the light.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Light comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But whenever through our prayer this light goes deeper, reaching into our spirit, it becomes life, and we receive the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This shows us the necessity of praying when we read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It makes no difference whether we read first and then pray, or pray and then read.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The point is that we need to pray as well as read.</S>
