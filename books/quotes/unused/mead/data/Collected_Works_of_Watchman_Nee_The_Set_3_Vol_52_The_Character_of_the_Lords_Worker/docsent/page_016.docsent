   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 24 says, "Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul illustrated his point with the example of a runner in a race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A Christian's service to the Lord and labor for his Master can be compared to a race.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone is running in this race; this is compulsory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one can exempt himself from it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Run in this way, that you may lay hold."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only one of the runners in a race receives the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if we all run, everyone can receive the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the difference between their running and our running.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul used the illustration of a racecourse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This illustration leads to verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 25 says, "And everyone who contends exercises self- control in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is Paul's emphasis: In order for a man to contend, he has to undergo training.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has to exercise self-control in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He cannot eat as he wishes or skip eating as he wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He cannot sleep as he wishes or skip sleep as he wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All athletes who compete in games are strictly disciplined during their training.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are strictly regulated as to what they can eat and what they cannot eat, when they can sleep and when they should wake up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before a game begins, they have to follow strict rules such as not drinking or smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once the game starts, there are stricter rules to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why verse 25 says that everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may think that it is hard to drop their smoking, drinking, or favorite pastimes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when a man prepares for a race, he has to strictly control his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What are the things he has to exercise self-control in?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has to exercise self-control in the demands of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He cannot allow his body to have too many demands or to have too much freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In running a race the body is reserved for only one thing the race.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not for eating, clothing, smoking, drinking, or sleeping, but for running.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many runners have to abstain from sweet and starchy food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This does not mean that these foods are harmful or useless; rather, they do not help a runner in his race.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to be a runner, a person has to exercise self-control in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 27 speaks of buffeting the body; that is, the body is brought into the discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The body has to be under control; it has to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of the faculties of the body are reserved for just one thing running, the kind of running that will win first prize.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 25 continues, "They then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The runners exercised much self-control for the sake of a corruptible crown.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Should we who are after an incorruptible crown not exercise much more self-control?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The corruptible crown refers to the Greek garlands of flowers, which lasted only for three to five days.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A runner had to go through long periods of training before he could have a chance to win such a corruptible crown.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul said, "They then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should pay attention to Paul's comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek runners ran on the racecourse, while we run in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their running was an exercise of the body, while our running is our service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In their running, only one received the prize, but in our running, everyone can receive the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their prize was a corruptible crown, but our prize is an incorruptible crown.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are different contrasts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, one thing holds true in both races exercising self-control in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Self-control is necessary in both cases.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They exercised self-control to win the race, while we exercise self-control to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The goals may be different, but the discipline imposed on the body is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One has to exercise self-control in running the race, and as Christians we also have to exercise self-control in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 26 says, "I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that Paul was not running in an aimless way; he knew where he was going.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He said that he buffeted his body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means his boxing was not beating the air; he was beating his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should consider verse 26 together with verse 27.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 26 tells us that Paul was not without a clear aim.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He did not run in whatever way others directed him to; he had a definite direction in his running.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Neither was his boxing a beating of the air.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then in verse 27, he immediately points out that he was buffeting his body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was hitting his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We pointed out earlier that buffeting means a kind of hitting, one which produces bruises all over one's body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not ordinary hitting, but a kind of severe beating.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Ordinary hitting does not produce bruises.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Paul dealt with his body in a harsh way so that his body would come under his control.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He did it to make his body his slave.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means he would not allow his body to become loose.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He brought it under his own control.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The goal for such an exercise is to make the body the slave, while the means is the buffeting of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We buffet our body so that it may become our slave.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers and sisters, if we do not overcome in this matter, it would be better for us to wait for three to five years and learn this lesson before we attempt to touch God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every servant of God must learn to bring his body under his control.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Bible shows us that a worker of the Lord is like a runner.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He may take great pleasure in the work, but it will have little value if his body is not under his control.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Service to the Lord is not a simple thing; it is not merely a matter of preaching sermons from a platform.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Paul shows us here that only those who will buffet their bodies and make them their slaves can serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If your body cannot obey, you need more training from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do not think that a little aspiration will qualify a person to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God's workers must buffet their body and make it their slave.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If their body will not obey them, they are of little use to the work.</S>
