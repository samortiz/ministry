   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING UP THE PROPER AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church should function in this way, and the administration of any country should also function in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>New measures are not produced by quarrels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order for a new measure to become a law, the legislative body of a country must function appropriately and legally.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Quarrels are not effective.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a problem is before us, we should not express numerous different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no need to quarrel in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, we should build up the authority, the wall, to protect all the saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must learn this lesson in order to do a serious work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan s stratagem is to damage God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, we should not encourage the atmosphere of freely expressing our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such an atmosphere will damage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not encourage fleshly activities or the expression of human opinions in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should receive the dealing from the Lord and allow the Lord to build Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ones who have learned the lesson before the Lord and have been perfected know that there is order in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This does not mean that such ones are an authority; rather, they keep their position.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have not learned the lesson and have not been built by God, our work will not be for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who are saved through us will be wild because we have not been built by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those whom we perfect will also be wild.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will not be able to build because we have not passed through the process of being built.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consequently, the Lord will have no way in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today Christianity is chaotic.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many opportunities for those who take the way of chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They can even establish a congregation at will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But those who desire to do the work of God s building need to learn serious lessons and see through the enemy s stratagems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This does not involve the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our opinion may be correct, but we can still be persons who do not walk according to order, do not obey authority, and have not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we have not learned the lesson, we will not know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A brother responsible for a group meeting does not have the authority to decide something concerning the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the churches in Taiwan use large cups for the Lord s table, it is foolishness for a group meeting to change to small cups.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This proves that we have not learned any lessons and do not know the church and the building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows that we are presumptuous and audacious persons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must learn this serious lesson, and then we can do a serious work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a work will be valuable because it will be the building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Building up authority does not mean building up our personal authority; rather, it means building up God s order in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a person touches this authority, he will realize that this is the church and that God s order is here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God can have a way, and we will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For hundreds of years many people have taken the way of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, that is not God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the Lord be gracious to us that we would know His building for the administration of the church and for the ministry of the word.</S>
