   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INCORPORATED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Christian life and the church life are not a matter of ethics, culture, or religion but a matter of the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, there is a fifth and final stage of the progressive revelation of God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the bachelor God, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, and the indwelling God are revealed, God is revealed as the incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous chapter we referred to the fifth stage as the married God, but I believe the incorporated God is a better term.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be married is to be incorporated with another person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the fifth stage of the revelation of God, which is found in the last book of the Bible, God becomes the married God, meaning that He is incorporated with all His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis 1 God is revealed as the bachelor God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the four Gospels He is revealed as the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the end of the Gospels He is the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Acts and the Epistles God becomes the indwelling God, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, in Revelation He becomes the incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation 21:2 describes a city that is a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The holy city is a living city composed of all God s redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 12 reveals that the names of the twelve tribes are inscribed on the twelve gates of the city, and verse 14 reveals that the names of the twelve apostles are on the twelve foundations of the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The names of the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles being on the city signifies that all God s redeemed saints from both the Old Testament and New Testament times will be included in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verses 19 and 20 these saints who compose the city are likened to precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter wrote, You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This spiritual house will eventually be enlarged into a city.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now let us look at the center of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The city may be likened to the rim, the circumference, of a wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The hub, the center, of this wheel is God and the Lamb, the Lamb-God, the incarnated and redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a picture!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lamb is the lamp of the city, and God is the light in the lamp Rev 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God in the Lamb as the light in the lamp is the center, the hub, of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Out of this Lamb-God proceeds a river of water of life 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God the Father is the light in the lamp, God the Son is the Lamb as the lamp, and God the Spirit is the river.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the Triune God flows out to supply the city.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I was young, I was bothered by the fact that this city has only one street 21:21; 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I could not understand how one street could serve twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, I learned that it is a spiral street.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From the throne it spirals out, passing through every part of the city, until it reaches the gates at the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the river that proceeds out of the Lamb-God is in the middle of the street, and the tree of life grows on both sides of the river v. 2 , we can see that the river waters every part of the city and supplies every part with the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation 22:17 says, The Spirit and the bride say, Come!...</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 14 says, Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Spirit is the river, and Christ is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit flows in a spiral to water every part of the building of God with Christ as the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, every part of the city is constituted with the elements of the water of life and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, the Triune God the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit is ministered into all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will be incorporated with God, and God will be incorporated with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God and all His redeemed will become a great incorporation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God will no longer be only the God of creation, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, and the indwelling God, but He will also be the incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, we will all be part of this incorporated God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We will all be incorporated with God in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To believe only in the God of Genesis 1 is to hold the Jewish faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Orthodox Jews believe in God according to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fundamental Christians believe in God also according to the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They believe in the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, but redemption is seemingly all they know.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They do not seem to care much about God in the Epistles, the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are some advanced Christians, whom we call the inner-life people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Their knowledge and experience are truly deeper than most because they care for the indwelling Christ, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They speak much about spirituality, walking in the Spirit, and the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Keswick Convention in England is related to the inner life and to the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I appreciate the inner-life people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After being redeemed, we surely need to go on from the four Gospels to the Epistles to enjoy Christ as the indwelling One.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we also need to realize that this is not the ultimate consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The ultimate consummation, which is produced by the indwelling Spirit, is the incorporated God.</S>
