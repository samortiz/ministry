        <h2 class="head1">STOPPING OURSELVES, NOT CRITICIZING OTHERS,<br />
AND CARING ONLY FOR LIVING BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>People in so-called religion do many things for the Lord, but they do not live by the Lord. The Lord does not want us to be religious or to work and do things for Him. He does not want even our good behavior. None of these things means anything to Him. The basic revelation in the Bible is that our Lord is the Spirit who lives in our spirit and He desires that we would live by Him. Hence, the only thing that counts is living by the Lord.</p>
<p>In every local church there must be some who live by the Lord. If an elder lives by the Lord, all the saints will be influenced, and their spirits will be open. Satan is very subtle. Although we can touch our spirit, it is easy for Satan to influence our thoughts so that we consider and criticize others. This is often the source of our &ldquo;prayers&rdquo; for others. Such &ldquo;prayers&rdquo; do not come from our spirit but from our mind. We should simply live in the spirit and let the Lord take care of other matters. While it is not easy to stop ourselves and not criticize others, the Lord wants us to stop ourselves, to not criticize others, and to not consider others&rsquo; situations. The Bible speaks of numerous things, but the central and consummate revelation is that the God of all creation is in our spirit, and we can live by Him. At the end of the Bible, there is a city, the New Jerusalem. In this city God is life, and this city lives by God and lives out God.</p>
<p>Satan uses religion to usurp us. The religious concepts of Catholicism, Protestantism, and the various denominations influence many. Those who pursue spirituality also have concepts, even concepts concerning the breaking of the cross. Satan&rsquo;s way is to turn us from our spirit to methods based on our concepts. However, the Lord is in our spirit; therefore, we must live in our spirit. Living in our spirit is our way, our deliverance, and our true rest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL REVELATION OF THE BIBLE<br />
BEING TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT AND TO LIVE BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>If we live in our spirit, we will not talk about many things. If we do not live in our spirit, however, we will be influenced by many things. When we are in our spirit, there is no need to consider or discuss other things. When we follow the spirit, the church life is good and pleasant. When the Lord is living in us and we are living in the Lord, there is no need for our plans and considerations. According to the Bible, our only focus should be on living by Him as the Spirit. When a couple lives in the spirit, there are no problems. Even if one spouse wants to quarrel with the other, there will be no problem as long as one spouse is living in the spirit. Living in the spirit solves every problem.</p>
<p>Our past experiences may be good; however, if we try to apply them in the same way today, they can cause us to not live in the spirit. As soon as we try to apply them in an old way, we will suffer loss. Satan is very subtle; he &ldquo;planted&rdquo; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in man so that man would not live by the spirit as the tree of life. In this way man&rsquo;s living deviates from the focus of God&rsquo;s revelation. God&rsquo;s revelation is that He, as the Triune God, is our Creator, Redeemer, and Savior, and as the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;He is the all-inclusive Spirit to be life in our spirit so that we can live by Him.</p>
<p>The New Testament speaks of our being in our spirit and of our living by the spirit. Since we receive life in the spirit, we must walk in the spirit and do everything according to the spirit. The Lord must open our eyes to see the revelation in the Bible. We may have heard many traditional doctrines, but we need to see a revelation related to life in our spirit. We need to see the revelation in 1 Corinthians 15:45, which says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Many people know about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but they neglect the matter of the last Adam becoming a life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>When Christians greet one another, they often say, &ldquo;The Lord be with you.&rdquo; However, they do not know what the key is to the Lord&rsquo;s being with them. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; This refers to the Lord being in our spirit. The Bible has sixty-six books and contains many points, but what is the focus? For example, the Bible speaks of our experience of the cross, but this does not mean that we should be focused only on the cross or the altar for eternity. The only thing that God desires for us to do eternally is to live by Him. The altar is for us to live by the Lord, and the experience of the cross is for us to live by the Lord. The altar and the cross are for entering into the Holy of Holies; hence, it is not enough to focus on the altar but fail to see and to enter into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Today we have a simple way; that is, we need only to receive the all-inclusive Spirit. The altar of burnt offering, the laver, the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar are all in this Spirit. When we receive the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit, we are in the Holy of Holies. Strictly speaking, we do not pass through the altar of burnt offering by ourselves; we pass through in the Lord. Furthermore, we are not crucified on the cross by ourselves; we are crucified in the Lord. All the Lord&rsquo;s experiences of becoming flesh, of passing through the cross, of shedding His precious blood, and of accomplishing redemption are in this Spirit. Furthermore, He was buried, and He resurrected from the dead. He is the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar. He is everything. Today He is the all-inclusive Spirit, and as the all-inclusive Spirit, everything is in Him in order to be received by us.</p>
<p>Some people received help and experienced the altar of burnt offering and the golden incense altar in the past. However, when we call them to come forward to the Holy of Holies, they pay attention only to the incense altar. Our experiences at the altar of burnt offering and at the table of the bread of the Presence are for us to enter into the Holy of Holies. Surprisingly, after experiencing these things, some people still have not entered into the Holy of Holies. In other words, they still have not entered into the spirit. All these items&mdash;the altar of burnt offering, the laver, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar&mdash;are included in the all-inclusive Spirit. Our need today is to enter into the Holy of Holies and to enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p>We should simply return to the riches in our spirit. We should not wander in our mind. Even when we give a message, we should not be in our mind; we should simply be in the spirit and speak the word from our spirit. This is the need of the churches today. The co-workers should not speak the same old things in their service to the churches; the churches do not need the old practices. The churches need what can only come from the spirit, genuinely and directly. When we fully look to the Lord and simply live in our spirit by the Spirit, we will be fresh, living, and rich. We should stop the wandering in our mind and simply live in the spirit by the Spirit. This is what the Lord desires.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
