   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Believers Not Being Perfected</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by the Law after They Are Saved</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some ask, "It is true that we are saved by Christ and not by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But after we are saved, should we not keep the law?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to study Galatians because it deals exclusively with this question.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before many people believed in the Lord, they mistakenly thought that they could be justified by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After they believe in the Lord, they still think that they should keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul said that it is useless for a man to keep the law before he is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After he is justified, it is equally useless for him to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul wanted to show the Galatians that they were still unable to keep what they once could not keep.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us see how Paul dealt with those who insisted that believers should keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some told the Galatians that they should keep the law after they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1:6 Paul said, "I marvel that you are so quickly removing from Him who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 7 continues, "Which is not another gospel, only there are some who trouble you and desire to pervert the gospel of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These ones made the gospel of Christ no longer a gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 8 Paul spoke a strong word: "If even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then verse 9 says, "If anyone announces to you a gospel beyond that which you have received, let him be accursed."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul said that those who were distracting the Galatians should be accursed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 2:18 Paul said, "For if I build again the things which I have destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul said that those who preached another gospel should be accursed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He also said that if he were to build again the things which he had destroyed, that is, if he were to ask a saved person to keep the law again, he would prove himself to be a transgressor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ died to the law in order that we could live to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 20 says, "I am crucified with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since I am crucified with Christ, putting me under the law again would be unlawful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although I am a living person, I am crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We who live to Christ can no longer be placed under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The law only speaks to the natural man; it cannot speak to a dead man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verses 3:1 and 3 Paul spoke to the Galatians: "O foolish Galatians...are you so foolish?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul was saying that the law only addresses those who are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Galatians 5:22 and 23 say that there is no law against the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that the fruit of the Spirit is not under the control of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since it is not under the control of the law, the same Holy Spirit in us would never lead us to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The law is only meant for those in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who break the law are in the flesh, and those who keep the law are also in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once the law comes, the flesh becomes active, and the Holy Spirit is stifled because the flesh wars with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once a man tries to keep the law, the flesh is activated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a man does not try to keep the law, the flesh will not move.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The target of the law is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Galatians 3 clearly shows that we cannot be justified by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since we have begun by the Spirit, we cannot go back to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today many Christians still carry the flavor of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only are there Judaizers in the church, we may become a Judaizer ourselves if we are not careful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some do not understand God's plan and arrangement in His redemption; they only pay attention to the things of the law and thus make themselves Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since a Christian does not need to keep the law, does this mean that he can break the law?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please notice that God's intention for giving man the law was not for man to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God never says that those who keep the law will satisfy His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God did not give man the law with the intention that he would keep it, but with the intention that he would gain the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to differentiate between the law and the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not being covetous, honoring one's parents, and refraining from idolatry these are the righteousnesses of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God does not want man to keep the law but to gain the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In summary, God's intention in instituting the law is as follows: First, He apparently wants man to keep the law, but only for the purpose of exposing him so that he would see the futility of his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Second, He wants man to inherit the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Third, He wants man to have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to have life, a man cannot be lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without the righteousness of the law, he cannot receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When man inherits Christ as his righteousness, he inherits life as well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to the law, a man receives the righteousness of the law and inherits life if he keeps the law Lev 18:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today we can inherit the righteousness of the law and have life without keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As long as we believe in the Lord, we become righteous Gal 2:16 , and we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But after we have inherited life, the Judaizers say that we should keep the law in order to gain the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once a man tries to keep the law, the old man is revived.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are saved when God puts us into the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We inherit righteousness through the blood of the Lord, and we receive life by inheriting righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This life is not under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we want to keep the law, our flesh will have to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we try to keep the law, the flesh is revived.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The new life the Lord has given us is not under the law; rather, it fulfills the righteousness of law automatically within us.</S>
