<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Theocratic Government among<br>the People of Israel in the Old Testament</H2><P>The theocratic government among the people of Israel in the Old Testament was through the priesthood with the Urim and the Thummim (Exo. 28:29-30; Num. 27:15-23). The priests in the priesthood were very close to God, even one with God. God could open Himself to them, and they could open themselves to God so that there could be a mutual understanding between them and God. They had the ability, the capacity, to receive God's revelation, God's speaking, God's oracle.</P><P>The high priest wore a breastplate with twelve precious stones bearing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. Two items were added to the breastplate called Urim and Thummim. Urim means light, and Thummim means perfection. The Urim was something that enlightened the stones on the breastplate. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel on the twelve stones contained only eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Therefore, there was a shortage of four Hebrew letters on the breastplate. The Thummim was something added to the breastplate that bore these four additional letters to make the Hebrew alphabet complete on the breastplate. This is perfection.</P><P>When the high priest came into the presence of God, he received the speaking of God by means of the shining of the Urim on the twelve stones of the breastplate with the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, including the Thummim. The breastplate was like a typewriter to form words, phrases, and sentences. Thus, God spoke to the children of Israel through the high priest with the Urim and Thummim. (For more details regarding the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim, see messages 123 through 129 of Life-study of Exodus, pp. 1381-1434.)</P><P>The theocratic government among the people of Israel in the Old Testament was also through the coordination of the prophets (1 Sam. 3:1, 19-21). The prophets were a strengthening to the priesthood when the priesthood was not strong. This is why there was the need of both priests and prophets.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Theocratic Government<br>in the Churches in the New Testament</H2><P>The theocratic government in the churches in the New Testament is through the Spirit who dwells in the spirits of the apostles and the elders, both of whom are the New Testament priests, with the revelation of the New Testament teaching (Acts 15:6, 23, 28; 2:42; 1 Thes. 5:12; 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17). The Urim and Thummim on the breastplate of the high priest in the Old Testament typify the unveiling Spirit, the Holy Spirit, indwelling our receiving spirit, our regenerated spirit. These two spirits mingled together are today's Urim and Thummim. Whenever the apostles and the elders as the New Testament priests come to the Lord and wait on Him for His administration in the church, they will surely receive some light and some word from the Lord. By this way we have God's speaking in the administration of the church to carry out His theocratic government.</P><P>This theocratic government is also through the coordination of the New Testament prophets (Acts 13:1). In a local church there should always be some prophets to strengthen our inner feeling. This is the New Testament theocratic government for God's administration in the church to carry out His New Testament economy.</P><P>Now we need to consider the practical application of this fellowship in a local church. Whenever the elders of a local church come to the Lord, they come as priests. Because they bear the responsibility of the eldership, they want to know how to take the lead, how to teach, how to shepherd, how to oversee, and how to be patterns. Therefore, they have to pray together, to wait on the Lord. As they pray and fellowship, the indwelling Spirit will speak and enlighten them inwardly. In their regenerated spirit, they will receive something of the Lord. Then they will realize how the Lord wants them to take the lead, to shepherd, to oversee, and to be patterns. Because this may not be so adequate or strong, there are the prophets in the churches. The prophets' speaking strengthens the elders' understanding of the will of God. The functioning of the elders and the prophets in this way constitutes a kind of government for the administration of God in His church to fulfill His eternal purpose.</P><P>God's theocratic government in the churches in the New Testament is according to the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God indwelling the leading ones. When the leading ones go to the Lord to seek His leading, they receive some inner understanding. When the prophets prophesy, what they say strengthens the feeling of the leading ones. The result of this divine coordination of the New Testament priests and prophets in the Body of Christ is the God-commanded blessing (Psa. 133:3). I hope that all of us can now have a clear view concerning the New Testament leadership, including the headship of Christ, the leadership in the church life, the leadership in the ministry, and God's government in the administration of the churches.</P>
