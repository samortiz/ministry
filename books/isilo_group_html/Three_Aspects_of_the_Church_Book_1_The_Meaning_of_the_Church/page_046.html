<p>The second layer of the covering of the tabernacle was made of goats&rsquo; hair (Exo. 26:7-13). This layer denotes fallen humanity. The goats in Matthew 25 signify sinners, evil ones (vv. 32-33). In the Old Testament goats were often used as sacrifices for the trespass offering (Lev. 4:23, 28; 5:6). Hence, goats are related to sin. Furthermore, Exodus 26:7 says that the second layer of the covering was made of eleven curtains, not ten or twelve. Ten is the number of human perfection, and twelve is the number of perfection in the mingling of God and man. The number eleven indicates an excess because it is greater than ten, the number of human perfection, yet it is less than twelve, the number of the mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>A person normally has two hands and ten fingers. However, if a person&rsquo;s hand had six fingers, the sixth would be in excess. The second layer of the covering was composed of five curtains plus six curtains (v. 9), signifying the excessive condition of man before God. This excess is greater than what man should have yet less than what God is; thus, it is sinful and corrupt. To be less than God may not be sinful, but to be in excess of what man should have is sinful. Anything less than God but more than man is sinful and corrupted. Any time we have more than we should have, that is sin. Adam in the garden of Eden was a &ldquo;ten,&rdquo; but after Satan added himself to Adam, Adam became an &ldquo;eleven.&rdquo; In other words, he possessed something more than he should have possessed, that is, sin and corruption. Even today the church still has the nature of sin and corruption.</p>
<p>In the Bible animals signify man&rsquo;s need of God&rsquo;s redemption. The second layer of the covering was made of goats&rsquo; hair, of the animal life. This implies the need of redemption, that is, the covering of blood. The curtain of goats&rsquo; hair as the second layer signifies that today in the church there are still things that are fallen and corrupt and that God does not accept, which require redemption and the covering of the blood.</p>
<h2 class="head4">A Covering of Rams&rsquo; Skins Dyed Red</h2>
<p>The third layer of the tabernacle is a covering of rams&rsquo; skins dyed red (Exo. 26:14). This layer entirely covered the curtains of goats&rsquo; hair. This means that the corrupted humanity in the church is entirely covered by redemption. A person who entered the tabernacle or who stood outside of the tabernacle could not see the second layer of eleven curtains because it was totally covered by the rams&rsquo; skins dyed red. The blood covers our corrupted and sinful part. The color red is the color of blood, that is, the color of redemption. Because of this covering, God was able to say that He did not behold iniquity in Jacob (Num. 23:21). He beholds no sin in the church. All the sins and corruption of the church are under the covering of His blood. The Lamb was slain for us, and His blood and skin cover the church. Whether a person looks from the inside or from the outside, he will not be able to see the church&rsquo;s curtains of goats&rsquo; hair.</p>
<h2 class="head4">A Covering of Porpoise Skins</h2>
<p>The fourth layer, the outermost layer, of the tabernacle was a covering of porpoise skins (Exo. 26:14). Porpoise skins are thick, tough, and rough, without any beauty. Porpoise skins can withstand wind and rain and any type of condition. This signifies that the outermost layer of the church should be like porpoise skins, which have no outward splendor that man desires but that can endure all kinds of storms and attacks. This indicates that the church is not outwardly splendid or magnificent. Her beauty is God within.</p>
<p>Outwardly the tabernacle was made of porpoise skins, but inwardly it was made of gold and cherubim. The outward appearance of the church should not have anything that attracts people; rather, the beauty of the church is God within. Any person who tries to attract others by outward beauty or any church that tries to draw people by outward splendor violates the principle of the type of the tabernacle. Whatever can be seen on the outside should be rough, without any attractive or desirable form. This was the case with Christ, and this should be the case also with the church. Even though the church does not outwardly have any attractive appearance, she is strong and able to withstand any attack, storm, and difficulty. Any time the church has a magnificent outward appearance, inwardly it surely is weak and fragile. Such a church is just like a glass plate, which is outwardly nice but easily broken. Today some churches have a good outward appearance, but they fall and break easily. Some churches, however, are rough outwardly, but they are strong and beautiful inwardly.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 1, The Meaning of the Church &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
