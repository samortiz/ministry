   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Toward the Devil Shame</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In every Christian meeting we worship God, edify others, are built up, and shame God s enemy, the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the fourth aspect of the purpose of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we do not meet, we lose the opportunity to shame the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The meetings are the greatest shame to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the reason he does not like Christians to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whereas the positive side of Christian meetings is to receive grace, the negative side is to put Satan to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Putting Satan to shame involves two points.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Displaying God s Grace</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christian meetings are for the display of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The displaying of God s grace is a shame to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, a brother may stand up in a meeting and testify that he used to live in sin; he was bound by sin because he played mah-jongg and indulged in dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But now God has forgiven and saved him, the foremost of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another sister may testify of how she was saved from worshipping the devil and how hearing the gospel, she went home and burned all her idols.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These testimonies display God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The displaying of God s grace is a shame to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Exhibiting Christ s Victory</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christian meetings are also an exhibition of Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever we gather together, we exhibit Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can exhibit the victory of the Lord Jesus in the meeting by speaking of the Lord in our practical living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is also a great shame to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This does not mean that we come to the meeting in order to curse the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people continually curse Satan in their prayers, saying, Lord, curse Satan and bind him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This kind of cursing is not very effective.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to display God s grace to us and exhibit Christ s victorious work upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a display and exhibition are a shame to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christian meetings glorify God and shame the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, we do not meet merely to attend a so-called Sunday service; rather, we meet to worship God, edify others, be built up, and shame the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are great and important matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>PREPARING BEFORE A MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Having covered the purpose of meeting, let us now consider our preparation before a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should prepare ourselves before every meeting in order to be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are also four aspects to our preparation toward God, toward man, toward ourselves, and toward the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Toward God Dealing with Offenses</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>and Removing Barriers</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before coming to a meeting, we need to come before God to deal with our offenses and mistakes and with any condemnation in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These need to be dealt with by the Lord s blood one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the sense of condemnation in our conscience is cleared, the barrier between God and us is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not come to a meeting with a barrier between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do, we will bring burden and death to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, before every meeting we must come before God and have a thorough dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through prayer and confession, we should ask for forgiveness and cleansing by the Lord s blood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should comply with whatever God requires of us, and we should remove whatever He wants us to remove.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must remove all the barriers in order to commune with God freely.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do this, we will be a benefit to the meeting, and we will benefit from the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Toward Others Willing to Minister and Help</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we prepare for a meeting, we need to have a desire to minister and help others in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not right for us to have an indifferent and nonchalant attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should care for others and be willing to be used by the Lord to supply and help others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must remember that whoever supplies others will be supplied, and whoever helps others will be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we supply others, the more we are supplied, and the more we help others, the more we are helped.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we stop supplying others and have no desire to help, we will not receive much supply or help.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even if we were saved yesterday, we should prepare ourselves in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not think that we cannot offer any help because we do not know anything and cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This concept must be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No matter who we are, by the Lord s mercy our attitude must be that we are pleased to allow God s grace to flow through us so that others may be supplied and helped.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to prepare in such a way before the meeting.</S>
