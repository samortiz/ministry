   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LETTERS FROM PEKING One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear brother:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have not written for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I think of you often!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During this time, I have been living a life of warfare in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although I have failed many times, I believe that God is causing me to learn some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Truly, I now see that to begin to overcome, we must first overcome the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the same time, He has allowed me to see that Satan is real and active here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank God, He wants to lead us to overcome!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am not confused inwardly now.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have had the experience of Habbakuk 3:16-19.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because of this, I am not in such a sad and distressed condition as I was before.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Truly, thinking of myself all the time is the most miserable thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May God cause me to forever escape from this cursed self.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother, please instruct me and pray for me!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Miss Miao came from Tsinan to Peking a few days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There will probably be a few days of women's meetings, but we do not know how the Lord will lead them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Mr. Chi, who once wrote an article about correcting the name of pastor and teacher, recently got smallpox in Jehol and died.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This event really awakened me to take advantage of today to labor more for the Lord, to watchfully prepare, and to wait to see the Lord's face!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now I will speak of the meeting in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I can tell you a little of its condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thank God, there has been some revival recently.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The brothers bear more of the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those outside the meeting here think that this meeting does not allow outsiders to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not know why they have this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On top of this, our furnishings are not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not have many chairs, so some do not want to come.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank God, He adds the number of saved ones to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some brothers and sisters will be baptized soon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are many difficulties here, and I cannot relate to you all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May God cause us to live more according to His will and to please Him!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Please pray for us unceasingly!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How is your physical health?</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I do not want to say too much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I greet you with this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Your little brother,</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>June 8, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Dear brothers in the Lord, Watchman and Witness:</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I received your letter and read it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After receiving your exhortation, I will do my best to live up to your high expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But my knowledge is shallow, and my language ability is not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I do not know if I can attain to your hopes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank the Lord, there was a baptism meeting recently.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Three or four people were put into the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sister Miao might do some work next week.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>She still has not been able to decide.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hope you will pray for the meeting in Peking!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the Lord allows, perhaps there will be a few days of conference meetings at the beginning or end of July.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May the Lord especially bless this conference so that it will be able to touch people's hearts, causing them to obey the truth and be gained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the first struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I hope you brothers pray much for us so that the Lord will use me, this weak and ignorant little one, to revive His own work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Have you been busy with the work recently?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Have people been sending articles to Shanghai?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I think of you often!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Greet the brothers and sisters for me!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I respectfully bless you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
