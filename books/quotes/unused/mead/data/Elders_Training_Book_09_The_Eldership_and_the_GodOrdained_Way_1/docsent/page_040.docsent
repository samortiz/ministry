   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE ORGANIC WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO CARE FOR THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AS THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter we want to see the organic way to care for the church as the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spiritual things in the divine revelation are very mysterious, so God used physical things as symbols and figures to help us see them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 3:4 the church is called the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, Colossians 2:2 says that Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are going to know God, we have to know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ Himself is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are going to know Christ, we have to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is a mystery, Christ is a mystery, and the church is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the church were an organization, it would not be a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What can give us a definition, an understanding, and an apprehension of this mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible, God uses our human body as a figure and as a picture of the church Rom 12:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the spiritual things are mysterious, pictures are needed to describe them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A picture is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why the New Testament uses our human body to illustrate the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE ORGANIC CARE FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we want to know how to take care of the church as the organic Body of Christ, we have to consider how we take care of our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Surely we do not take care of our physical body in an organizational way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us come back to the New Testament to see what it says concerning the organic care for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ephesians 5:29 says, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as we nourish and cherish our physical body, Christ nourishes and cherishes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A person loves his physical body by nourishing and cherishing it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some have asked me why I am so healthy at my age and why I have lived so long.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first thing I exercise to do is to eat the proper thing and to eat well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not eat roughly or quickly, nor should we eat when we are angry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to learn to eat the right thing by the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is what it means to nourish and cherish our body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to nourish and cherish our body in order to live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every day we nourish our body with at least three meals.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eating nourishes us, but eating the wrong thing in the wrong way can also kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Alexander the Great died when he was thirty-three because of overeating and overdrinking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The proper eating nourishes, but improper eating can gradually kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To eat roughly and wrongly is a kind of gradual suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Long life, of course, is a gift from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The length of our life is up to Him, but we still must cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During my life, the Lord allowed me to have certain illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These illnesses taught me a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By being ill, I learned how to keep myself healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all have to learn how to nourish the church in a proper way to keep the church healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not try to govern the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is organization.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To nourish the church is organic.</S>
