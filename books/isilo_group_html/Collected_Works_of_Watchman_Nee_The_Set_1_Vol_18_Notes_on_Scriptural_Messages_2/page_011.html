I like the flowers and birds on that mountain. I do not like to place birds in cages; I like to see them flying freely. One day the birds came and ate up all the rice I left on the railing. This was very interesting, and I went and got a whole bowl of rice. As soon as I walked close to them, the birds flew away; after I left, they all flew back. I had no intention to catch them or hurt them. I was more than happy for them to come and eat my rice. I thought it would be the happiest thing for me to sit in the midst of the birds while they surrounded me on all sides. But they did not know my heart, and they always avoided me. If I wanted the birds to know my heart, the only way was for me to speak their language or become a bird flying among them and telling them my intention. Then I would not be misunderstood. But there was no way that I could become a bird; consequently, there was no way for me to show my heart to them. This is the same way God feels about us. God loves us; He likes us. He wants us to be close to Him. But we do not understand His heart. God's Word tells us that God has spoken of old in many portions and in many ways through His servants concerning His heart's desire and that He loves us. But man did not understand. Therefore, God had to personally come to this world and become a man. This man is Jesus, the Christ, whom we know. If I became a bird, you might say that I humiliated myself. But for God to become a man is more of a humiliation. What humility that the God of glory would lower Himself to become a man! He is far above all, but He emptied Himself, took the form of man, and came in the likeness of men. When Jesus was on the earth, everything He did expressed God's love toward men. If you read the life of Jesus, you will find out that He is not only a good man but God from heaven becoming a man. We thought that God hated us. But He became a man in order to show us that God is the same as Jesus. He was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years; during this time He expressed God's heart. God is the same as Jesus. The way Jesus treated men is the way God treats men.</P><P>Once, a man full of leprosy came to worship Jesus and said, "Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me" (Luke 5:12). Jesus very easily could have made him clean by one of His words. Instead, He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed!" (v. 13). A man full of leprosy is unclean and smelly! But the Lord put forth His hand and touched him. He sympathized with this man. He seemed to be saying, "If others are not willing to come to Me, and you are willing, I will touch you."</P><P>Another time, a woman caught in adultery was brought to the Lord (John 8:3-11). According to the law, such a woman should be stoned to death. The Lord Jesus could not say that she did not commit sin, yet He did not want to see her stoned to death. Therefore, He said, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her" (v. 7). They were all convicted in their own consciences and left one by one, from the oldest to the youngest. Then Jesus was left alone, and the woman stood before Him. What did the Lord say? He said, "Has no one condemned you?" (v. 10). She said, "No one, Lord." Jesus then said, "Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more" (v. 11).</P><P>O friends! If you have not believed, let me tell you that God does not hate you; rather He loves you.</P><P>On another occasion, a publican named Matthew invited many publicans and sinners to his house, and he also invited Jesus. At that time the publicans were a very despised kind of people. The Jews had lost their country and were under the domination of Rome. For a Jew to work for those who conquered his country and dealt harshly with his own people, was something very despicable. If it were us, we would not have eaten or drunk with them. But Jesus ate and drank with them. Would you as a college student be willing to sit with such people? You might think that if a newspaper reporter found out that you were socializing with such people, it would be a big disgrace to you. But in any case, Jesus went. At that time there was another kind of people called the Pharisees. When they saw this, they spoke to Jesus' disciples, saying, "Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?" They were debating and criticizing. But how did Jesus reply? He said, "Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill...For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners" (Matt. 9:10-13). Jesus opened up God's heart to men. Some may wonder, "Does God still want me? I am such a terrible sinner." Others may wonder if God would want persons like themselves because they have robbed others, committed adultery, told lies, and been unclean and filthy sinners. But Jesus has opened up God's heart and shown us that God wants us and loves us. He is, in effect, saying, "I am like a doctor, and I am not afraid of patients." Are patients afraid of doctors? Of course they are not afraid. Some may make up their minds to be better persons from now on, never losing their temper, playing cards, or going to the movies. But they can only do this for two or three days; then they misbehave again. Some may think that God does not like them and wants them to perish. But I must tell you that God wants you because He loves you! Friends, please do one thing today: remove the veils from your eyes so that you can see that God has no evil intentions toward you. He loves you.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 18: Notes on Scriptural Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
