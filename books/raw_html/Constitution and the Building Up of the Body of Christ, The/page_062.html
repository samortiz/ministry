<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. No Dust of Humanity</H2><P>In the New Jerusalem, there will be no dust of humanity. We were created by God of the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7). We are dusty persons, because we were made of dust. It is not a matter of whether we are good or bad but of whether we are dusty or transformed. The brothers may pretend to be gentlemen and the sisters to be ladies, but actually they are dusty. This is why the more we stay in the church life, the more we are exposed. When we first come into the church life, this is our church life "honeymoon." But after this honeymoon time in the church life, everything may become unpleasant, because all the dust comes out. Then everybody knows that we are dusty. We are neither good nor bad, but we are all dusty. But there will be no dust in the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. No Plant of the Human Life</H2><P>In the New Jerusalem, there will be no plant of the human life. There will just be gold, pearls, and precious stones. In the New Jerusalem there will be no plants or trees of the plant life to shade us, but Christ Himself will be our canopy in the New Jerusalem. This is clearly prophesied in the book of Isaiah (4:5-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. No Leaven of the Enemy</H2><P>In the New Jerusalem, there will be no leaven of the enemy (Matt. 13:33; 1 Cor. 5:6-8), because we will all be transformed into pearls and precious stones, which cannot be leavened. My burden is to show all the saints that if we mean business to keep the oneness for the Lord's recovery, we must learn to be transformed. We must not remain in the plant stage. We have to be transformed from dust into plants, and from plants into transformed, precious materials. Then there will be no leaven. When there is no leaven, everything will be pure, there will be no trouble, and the church will be built up in peace with the transformed saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. As the Pure, Exclusive, and Absolute Expression<br>in the Corporate Manifestation of the Processed and Consummated Triune God Mingled with<br>the Regenerated, Transformed, and Glorified Tripartite Men for Eternity</H2><P>The New Jerusalem will be the pure, exclusive, and absolute expression in the corporate manifestation (Rev. 21:11) of the processed and consummated Triune God (vv. 22-23) mingled with the regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite men for eternity. We have to read and study the outlines with the verses in this book so that we can see how we should live and behave in the church life (cf. 1 Tim. 3:15). Then the church can be built up with the mature saints and even built up to the uttermost with the transformed saints.</P><P>We need to spend some time to read the Scripture references, the outlines, and the fellowship in this book with prayer. Then the Lord will have a way to lead us into a realization of the deeper significance of all these points.</P>
