   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This experience clearly shows that they are practicing the Christian life in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the secret of Christian living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is the Lord in you who is living the Christian life, not you living it by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you live the Christian life by yourself, endurance will be a suffering to you, as will love, humility, and bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if Christ lives in you, endurance will be a joy; so will love, humility, and bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brothers and sisters, you may be tired of trying to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may feel that the Christian life is consuming you and binding you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if you see that you no longer need to live, you will agree that this is a great gospel to you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every Christian can be spared such a wearisome living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a great gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You no longer have to exert so much effort trying to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You no longer have to bear such a heavy burden for your Christian life!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You can say, "In the past I heard the gospel which told me that I could be spared death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank God, I no longer need to die.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today I am tired and weary of living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God says that I can be spared living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank God, I no longer need to struggle to live."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is, of course, a suffering for us to die.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But it is equally a suffering for us to live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have no idea what God's holiness is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not know what love is and what the cross is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For men like us to try to live unto God is indeed an unbearable burden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we try to live, the more we sigh and suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a big struggle to labor and strive to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In fact, it is altogether impossible for us to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We could never satisfy God's demands.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people always have a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Others can never be humble; they are always proud.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For a proud person to try to live in God's presence and act humbly every day is a very wearisome and tiring task.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul was a weary and worn-out Christian in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said, "For to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" v. 18 . Every day he willed, but every day he failed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why he could only sigh, "Wretched man that I am!" v. 24 . Actually, being a Christian is not an exercise akin to putting a carnal man in heaven and subjecting him to slavery there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fortunately, no carnal man can enter heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, as soon as he entered it, he would run away quickly; he would not be able to stand even one day there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His temperament would be too different from God's temperament, and his thought too far from God's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His ways would be too different from God's ways, and his views too different from God's view.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How would he ever be able to meet God's demands?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There would be nothing he could do before God except run away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this is a gospel for you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God does not want you to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He does not want you to make up your mind to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God only wants Christ to live in you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God does not care about good or bad; He cares about who is doing the good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is not satisfied with good alone; He wants to know who is doing the good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, God's way is not for us to imitate Christ or to walk like Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Neither is it to plead on our knees for strength to walk like Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's way is for us to experience that it is "no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do we see the difference here?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not a matter of imitating Christ's life, nor of being empowered to live this life, but a matter of no longer being the ones living at all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God does not allow us to live according to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not come to God by ourselves; we come to God through Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not a matter of imitating Christ or of receiving some power from Christ, but of Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the living of a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The living of a believer is one in which it is no longer him who lives, but it is Christ living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the past I was the one who lived, not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But today, it is not I who live, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Another One has come to live in my place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a person cannot say, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me," this person does not know what Christianity is; he does not know the life of Christ, nor the life of a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is merely aspiring to be "not I but Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But Paul did not say that he was striving to be this way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He told us that this was how he lived.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His way was to stop living by himself and to let Christ live instead.</S>
