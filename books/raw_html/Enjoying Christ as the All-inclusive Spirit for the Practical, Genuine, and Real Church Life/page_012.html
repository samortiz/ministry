	 <h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the King James Version, Romans 8:16 renders the pronoun for the Spirit as &ldquo;itself,&rdquo; leaving the impression that the translators of that version did not realize that the Holy Spirit is a person, considering Him simply as a kind of power or instrument. From the time of the American Standard Version of 1901, people began to see more clearly that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, so that at least since then, translations refer to the Spirit as &ldquo;He&rdquo; or &ldquo;Himself.&rdquo; However, some of the Brethren continued to teach that we should not pray to the Holy Spirit but only to the Father and sometimes to the Lord. I myself was taught in this way, because I was under the teaching of the Brethren for seven years. I adopted their teaching, and I tried to practice it. Many times I began my prayer by saying, &ldquo;O Father in heaven.&rdquo; Then after a few minutes I realized that the One to whom I was praying is not only in heaven but also within me. At this point I might pray, &ldquo;O Lord, O Father, my Lord.&rdquo; I was very bothered when this happened, wondering whether He is the Father or the Lord. After this, I was more cautious when I prayed, carefully considering whether I should pray to the Father or to the Lord. This demonstrates that we have been too influenced by the traditional teaching of Christianity.</p>
<p>In 1933 I gave up my job and went to Shanghai, China, to visit Brother Watchman Nee. He received me as his guest and also as his trainee for four months. One day Brother Nee invited a traveling preacher from the China Inland Mission churches to give a message in our meeting. At a certain point in his message, the preacher said, &ldquo;Please, do not think that Jesus is one and the Holy Spirit is another. You must all realize that the Lord Jesus and the Spirit are one. Today Jesus the Lord is the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Brother Nee, who was sitting in the back of the meeting, boldly said Amen! That surprised us all very much. After that meeting, while dinner was being prepared, Brother Nee took me on a little walk. I took the opportunity to ask him why he had so boldly said Amen. He told me, &ldquo;This message is what we need. It is right to say that the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because there were not many saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery at that time, the work among us was not great. This gave Brother Nee the time to sit with the eight or ten trainees living there and have some free talk. This went on for a long period of time. These were wonderful times, and I can never forget them. At a certain point he was burdened to expound John 14 to us. Formerly, the Brethren had taught me mostly concerning types and prophecies, such as the seventy weeks and the ten toes, four beasts, seven heads, and ten horns (Dan. 9:24; 2:34; 7:2-3; Rev. 13:1; 17:3). At this time, however, Brother Nee sat down to speak something more profound from John 14. He pointed out how Philip foolishly asked Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us&rdquo; (v. 8). Jesus answered, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?&rdquo; (vv. 9-10a). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know by now that if you see Me, you see the Father? You have seen the Father every day for several years. The Father is in Me, and I am in the Father. We are one.&rdquo; Verse 16 continues, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&rdquo; Then in verse 18 the pronoun changes from <em>He</em> to <em>I:</em> &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; <em>He</em> (the Comforter) in verse 16 is <em>I</em> (Jesus) in verse 18. Therefore, the Lord Jesus is not only the Father but also the Spirit. We must receive this word, because it is the word of the Bible in John 14. When Brother Nee shared this with us, my eyes became open. This was truly new to me.</p>
<p>We do not teach in a light way that Christ is the Son, the Father, and also the Spirit. We have spent many years studying this matter in the Bible and in our experience. The New Testament tells us that the Father is in us (Eph. 4:6), the Son is in us (2 Cor. 13:5; Col. 1:27), and the Spirit is in us (John 14:17). According to our experience, do we have three or one in us? In John 14:23 Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; Here the Lord said that &ldquo;We,&rdquo; the Father and the Son, will abide in the disciples. However, it is not accurate to say that two or three dwell in us, because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</p>
<p>Shortly before Brother Nee was imprisoned, he wrote a hymn that says,</p>
<p class="hbody">Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called,<br />
But now the Holy Spirit art;<br />
The Spirit is Thine other form,<br />
Thyself to dwell within our heart.<br />
(<em>Hymns,</em> #490)</p>
<p>Later, after we came to Taiwan, we further saw the truth in 1 Corinthians 15:45b, which says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; At that time the light shined brightly from this verse. About the same time we also saw 2 Corinthians 3:17: &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; We looked into many different translations to find the correct rendering of this verse. We found that John N. Darby, in his New Translation, places verses 7 through 16 in parenthesis, meaning that in Darby&rsquo;s realization, verse 17 directly continues verse 6. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life,&rdquo; and verse 17 continues, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord in verse 17 is the Spirit who gives life in verse 6.</p>
