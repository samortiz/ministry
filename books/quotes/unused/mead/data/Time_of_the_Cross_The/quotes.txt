[1]  Every time we consider the cross, it invokes wonder in us!
[2]  Every time we remember the redemption of the Lord Jesus, our hearts are filled both with sorrow and with joy.
[3]  To us the Lord's cross is not just a wooden cross, but a symbol of His full redemptive work and of the full salvation accomplished through this redemptive work.
[4]  If the blood of bulls and goats was not able to remove sin, as we mentioned earlier, how then were those in the Old Testament saved?
[5]  Although the Bible says that the Lord Jesus once offered up the sacrifice for sins, it points out that "having offered one sacrifice for sins, He sat down forever..."
[6]  Those entering the Holy of Holies had to pass through the veil.
[7]  The veil signifies the body of the Lord Jesus.
[8]  If the Lord Jesus had not died and had not broken His body, men could not pass through Him and could not enter the Holy of Holies.
[9]  At the present time, we come to God through the death of the Lord Jesus.
[10]  God Himself knows the eternal worth of His Son's cross.
[11]  He has manifested to all the eternal freshness of the cross of His Son.
[12]  The realization of the eternal freshness of the cross brings power.
[13]  If we truly see the Lord's cross all the time, if we truly see how He suffered there, if we see the wounds on His hands and feet and the crown of thorns on His head, if we see how His love and blood mingled, and if we see His sufferings and sorrow, will we not be deeply moved, and will we not cease from doing things that do not please Him or cause Him sorrow?
[14]  If we realize this, we will break forth in loud praises to God the Father.
[15]  Unfortunately, many people do not know that they are saved forever.
[16]  If we have once truly accepted the Lord's sacrifice for sin, and if we have once truly trusted in the merit of His cross, His cross will forever speak for us.
