   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RAW GOD AND THE PROCESSED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the past, I never used such terms as processed God or raw God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These terms sound strange to religious ears.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most of these terms came as a result of the enlightenment regarding the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anything that has been compounded has been processed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If it has not been processed, then how could it be compounded?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our God has truly been compounded.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is no longer raw ; He is the compounded God, the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before the olive oil was compounded, it was raw.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after it was compounded, it was no longer raw.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Based upon this fact, I have the boldness to say that before Christ s death, resurrection, and ascension, the Spirit of God was not processed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, after Christ s death, resurrection, and ascension, the Spirit of God became processed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This word is unacceptable to the ears of theologians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Lord s recovery, the Lord has surely shown us something deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Most Christians do not have this experience or this knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>DEALING WITH PEOPLE REGARDING THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you meet other Christians, it is better not to touch the issue of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What should you do if they raise this question?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Firstly, do not argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Listen to all their points, take them down, and ask them to explain the matters to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more they talk, the more they will be snared.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not play politics and do not say a word in reply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, you should say, I will consider these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I certainly would like to study the truth with you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May we get together for this purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If what you have told me is right, I will take it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If what I have been taught is wrong, I will repent and give it up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that, by the mercy and grace of God, you would have the same attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>None of us should have the assurance that we are clear concerning such a thing as the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Take all the points home with you, pray, fellowship with others, and seek the Lord s leading how to contact them again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you see them again, do not argue over any points.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Simply read to them certain verses or give them some of the booklets that are suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes you need to read certain paragraphs to them, perhaps even asking them to read.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they argue, do not argue back, but say, I would like to see what the pure word of the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they continue to argue, then listen to their arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Take time and be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps during your next contact with them you will read Isaiah 9:6 or 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not fight with them, but maintain the good attitude of a learner, of one who wants to study the pure revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe that this will open the door and give an opportunity for the Lord to do something in their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of course, you need to pray a great deal about this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, do not spend all of your time with this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do that, you will be snared by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At most, you should only spend a fourth of your time with the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the rest of your time should be spent on the positive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nevertheless, we would not give up the critical ones, but patiently contact them again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As they consider the pure revelation concerning the Triune God, they may lose their peace and sense the need to reconsider their belief.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not argue or fight with people, but have a good time with them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You need to pray much for them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If not many are convinced, at least a small number will be helped.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They will at least begin to question the charge that we are heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They will no longer have the peace or assurance to say that we are heretics.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You need to show them that although what we believe may be different and even against tradition, it is according to the pure word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all must conduct ourselves in this wise manner.</S>
