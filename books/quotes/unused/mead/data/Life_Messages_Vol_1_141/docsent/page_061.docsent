   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among any group of people there is a need for organization.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Though we say the church has none, there are practical matters to be taken care of and relationships to be worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who will open the doors of the meeting hall?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What relationship should there be among the churches in the Bay area?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Who should take the lead among the elders in a local church?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the relationship between the church and the work?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All these matters, which apparently concern organization, in the church are related to the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Any relationship that insults or damages the headship of Christ is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot work out these relationships properly without understanding the meaning of His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE UNIQUE HEADSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of all the members of our physical body, only one is the head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is the shoulder the head of the arm? the arm the head of the hand? the hand of the fingers? the fingers of the nails?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no subhead in the body, as medical doctors will confirm.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The head gives orders even to the fingernails directly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God will not allow anyone to share the headship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders should be careful about claiming to express His headship; they do not have even an indirect share in that headship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Catholic teaching that the popes represent Christ as the successors of Peter is a blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the denominations and even the small Christian groups also insult the headship of Christ by having a head.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A SHIFTING LEADERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Was not Peter the leader in the early days of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes, he surely was, but please notice that his leadership was not official, nor permanent, nor organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Peter stood up with the eleven on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:14 , he was the leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When his name is mentioned with the other Apostles in the Gospels or in the first part of Acts, it is always first e.g., Matt 10:2; Luke 6:13-14; Acts 1:13; 3:1; 5:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason was that during those periods Peter's spiritual measure exceeded that of the others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, notice the order of names in Galatians 2:9: James, Cephas Peter , and John.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why has James replaced Peter as the first one?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peter, as the rest of the chapter recounts, slipped in his spiritual standing out of fear of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Though he well knew there was no difference between the Jewish and Gentile believers, he withdrew from eating with the Gentiles when the Jews came down from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul, who was younger in the faith, rebuked him to the face for this failure to walk according to the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At this point the leadership was in the hands of James.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the account given in Acts 15 again James was the leading one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In that conference Peter had something to say and so did Paul, but it was James who gave the final word in verse 19: "Wherefore I decide that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>. Another example of this shifting leadership is the case of Barnabas and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was Barnabas who brought in Saul Acts 9:26-27 and whose name was mentioned first when they were called by the Holy Spirit to the work Acts 13:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the sequence of names changed in verse 43, indicating that between the two apostles the leadership depended upon the spiritual measure, not official appointment.</S>
