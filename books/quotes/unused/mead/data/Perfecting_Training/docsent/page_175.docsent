   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN ABSTRACT, MYSTERIOUS WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Don t make the leading in Romans 8 a material or physical thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am burdened to turn your understanding of Romans 8 from the physical way to the abstract, mysterious way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our God is almighty, but it seems even He cannot change your understanding concerning Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You understand Romans 8 mostly in a physical way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why I stressed the second item of the second group concerning the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You have to realize that things here do not refer to material or physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Things here refer altogether to divine, spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do have a physical, outward being, our body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We know that this physical, outward being is not so valuable as our inward, invisible being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today science mainly deals with the outward being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Education and scientific teachings mainly deal with the physical being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not so many teachings are genuinely touching our inward, invisible being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 8 doesn t touch the outward being that much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although it refers to the outward being to some extent, mainly it touches our inward, invisible being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I realize that these messages are somewhat mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not so easy even for me to give you some substantial illustrations from my experience concerning the automatic working of such a law of the Spirit of life within me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not easy because it is too abstract and too mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is such a thing within us, but it is difficult to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In my experience I do know that I have been under the working of this law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My daily living, my daily walk has been regulated by this automatic working law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many times I could only talk up to a certain point, and many times I would not go to a certain place or do certain things simply because there was an automatic working of the invisible, abstract, and mysterious law within me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This law is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This law is the Triune God with the Father as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is automatically all the day long working within you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need a vision to see the things in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not something natural.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is something of a spiritual revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why Paul, when he began to talk about the church as the Body of Christ, prayed for us that we might have a spirit of wisdom and revelation Eph 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He prayed that we wouldn t have the natural apprehension nor the religious way to understand the spiritual, invisible, mysterious, and abstract things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all need a change of our understanding and a change of our apprehension of the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Human apprehension cannot make these things substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only a spirit of wisdom can substantiate these things which are not substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need this spirit to know the law of the Spirit of life that works within us automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need a revelation of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But whether you have seen it or you have not seen it, still you have it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether you have realized it or you have not realized it, still you have it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The law of the Spirit of life is within you working automatically.</S>
