<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. A GREAT KING OVER ALL THE EARTH</H2><P>In Psalm 47 the psalmist speaks concerning God as a great King over all the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Peoples Clapping Their Hands<br>and Shouting to God<br>with the Voice of a Triumphant Sound</H2><P>In verse 1 the peoples are told to clap their hands and shout to God with the voice of a triumphant sound. For Jehovah Most High is awesome; He is a great King over all the earth (v. 2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God Subduing Peoples under Israel<br>and Choosing an Inheritance for Them</H2><P>Jehovah subdues peoples under Israel and nations under their feet. He also has chosen an inheritance for them as the excellency (glory) of Jacob, whom He loved (vv. 3-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God Arising amidst Shouting<br>at the Sound of a Trumpet</H2><P>"God arises amidst shouting;/Jehovah, at the sound of a trumpet" (v. 5). When we shout, God arises. If we do not shout, God may not arise.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Singing Psalms to Our King</H2><P>Next, the psalmist charges us to sing psalms to God our King. He is the King of all the earth, reigning over the nations and sitting upon His holy throne (vv. 6-8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Those Who Are Noble among the Peoples Being Gathered with the People of the God of Abraham</H2><P>Verse 9 goes on to say that those who are noble among the peoples have been gathered with the people of the God of Abraham. The shields of the earth belong to God; He is greatly exalted.</P>
