   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO A SPIRITUAL MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A regenerated believer, with his spirit enlivened and the Holy Spirit indwelling him, can still remain a carnal or fleshly believer, with his spirit still oppressed by his soul or body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is a specific path that a regenerated believer should specifically take in order to succeed in becoming spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Briefly, there can be at least two great changes in the life of a human being changing from a perishing sinner into a saved believer and changing from a fleshly believer into a spiritual one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Just as a sinner can, in fact, become a believer, a fleshly believer can, in fact, become a spiritual one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God can cause a sinner to become a believer and have His life; God can also cause a fleshly believer to become a spiritual believer and have His life more abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once a man believes in Christ, he becomes a regenerated believer; once he obeys the Holy Spirit, he becomes a spiritual believer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a man has a normal relationship with Christ, he becomes a Christian; and when a man has a normal relationship with the Holy Spirit, he becomes a spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only the Holy Spirit can make a believer spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The work of the Holy Spirit is to make a man spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the arrangement of God's way of redemption, on the negative side, the cross carries out a destructive work, destroying everything that is from Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit, on the positive side, carries out a constructive work, building up everything that is from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The cross makes it possible for the believers to be spiritual, and the Holy Spirit makes believers spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Being spiritual means belonging to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Holy Spirit strengthens the human spirit so that He may rule over the whole person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, if we pursue being spiritual, we should not forget the Holy Spirit and not put the cross aside, because the cross and the Holy Spirit work as the left and right hands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Neither can be spared and neither of these two work independently.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The cross always guides man to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit always guides man to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A spiritual believer must have experiences in his spirit with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If he wants to become a spiritual man, he must have several steps of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paying attention to these steps does not necessarily mean proceeding from step one to step two and from step two to step three.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For the sake of writing, however, they have to be written in sequence, although in actual experience they often occur simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although there are many things we want to mention about how believers progress to become spiritual men, believers should not forget previous teachings Section Two, Chapters Four and Five .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Believers should know that what hinders a man from being spiritual is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, if a believer can assume the final attitude that he should have toward the flesh, then he will progress easily.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is marvelous that the more a man is spiritual, the more he knows the flesh and discovers about the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man does not know the flesh, he is not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All of the things previously mentioned about the flesh Section Two, Chapter Five are the foundations for one to pursue being spiritual and cannot be neglected by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not pay attention to the flesh, no matter what kind of progress there may be, it will all be vain, superficial, and unreal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, when a believer knows how to deny the flesh and its activities, abilities, and opinions in all things, we can say that this man is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But, we would again like to mention something positive which is directly related to the spirit.</S>
