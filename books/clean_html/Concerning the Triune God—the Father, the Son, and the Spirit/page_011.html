<P>It is easy to read the Bible, but it is not easy to understand it. Actually, the Bible is not principally for man to understand, but for man to receive and enjoy. The Lord Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4). The words that proceed out of the mouth of God are the words of the Bible and they are just like food. Food is not for man to understand, but for man to receive, eat, and enjoy. Therefore, when we read the Bible, we should not exercise our mind overmuch to analyze or understand it, but simply take it according to what it says&#151;that is sufficient. If you use your mind to analyze and comprehend the Bible, it is unavoidable that you will understand it wrongly, thus misinterpreting the words of the Lord. For example, we read in Revelation of the seven Spirits of God (1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6). "Seven Spirits" means, in the original text, seven Spirits. Since this is so, let me ask you, Are there seven Spirits of God? If you say that God has seven Spirits, that is a great heresy. If on the other hand you say that the Spirit of God is not seven Spirits, you are disagreeing with what is clearly recorded in the Scriptures, for Revelation distinctly says "the seven Spirits of God." Is the Spirit of God, then, seven or one? There is no need to exercise the mind overmuch seeking an explanation. If God says there is one Spirit, then there is one Spirit; if God says there are seven Spirits, then there are seven Spirits.</P><P>Likewise, with the Father, Son, and Spirit, the three are one. It is exactly similar to the seven Spirits being one&#151;it is something which we cannot reason out or explain. For two thousand years many have attempted to resolve it with their mind, but none have succeeded. Concerning such a mysterious matter, if only we would cease our reasoning, all would be well. If we insist on analyzing it, one will say "seven," another will say "one," and we will begin to contend with one another. For two thousand years, many of the contentions in the church have been due largely to the different opinions rendered by men in connection with biblical doctrines.</P><P>In the Old Testament, the structure of the lampstand was quite unique: below was one lampstand; above were seven lamps (Exo. 25:31-37). It was one lampstand, yet it had seven lamps; there were seven lamps, yet it was one lampstand. The same picture is presented in Zechariah 4:2. Therefore, it is correct to say that there is one lampstand, and there is nothing wrong with saying that there are seven lamps. So also is the Spirit of God. Without question, He is one Spirit; but He is also called "the seven Spirits," that is, the sevenfold, intensified Spirit.</P><P>In the same principle, while our unique God has three persons&#151;Father, Son, and Spirit&#151;we should never consider Them as three Gods. Although They are three, yet They are one God; although one God, yet there are the three persons&#151;Father, Son, and Spirit. This is the unique God whom we serve and worship! And this also is the only Lord whom we believe and adore! Hallelujah!</P>
