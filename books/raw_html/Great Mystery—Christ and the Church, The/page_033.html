        <h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE ORGAN TO CONTACT GOD<br />
AND TO SEARCH MAN&rsquo;S INWARD PARTS</h2>
<p>In order to contact something, we must use the right organ. It is ridiculous to try to see with our eyes closed. It is also ridiculous to cover our ears in an attempt to hear. If we do not see something or hear something, it is because we are not using the correct organ, not because there is nothing to see or to hear. For example, if our sense of smell is not keen, we will not be able to tell whether the air is fresh or foul. This is not because there is no smell in the air but because we have lost our ability to smell. Thus, there may be a foul substance in the air, but we will not be able to detect it.</p>
<p>Many people say that there is no God, because they do not use the right organ, not because there is no God. God is Spirit; hence, man must worship God in spirit (John 4:24). If we do not use our spirit, God will not be real to us. It is not that God is not real&mdash;God exists&mdash;but that we are unable to sense Him if we do not use our spirit. As long as we use our spirit, we will sense God&rsquo;s presence. The gospel speaks of God being Spirit and of man having a spirit, in the hope that man will repent. To repent is to no longer live in the flesh, to no longer care only for physical needs, and to no longer live merely according to reason. To repent is to turn to our deepest part, our human spirit, that is, to take care of our spirit. This is the repentance that we need and that we should preach.</p>
<p>When a person turns to his spirit, he understands the purpose of human life and realizes that human efforts are of little value. If we are not in our spirit, we do not know the purpose and meaning of human life, nor do we know the need of our human life. We know the meaning of human life when we exercise our spirit. If we want to know good and evil and right and wrong, we must not remain in reason; rather, we must exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>Proverbs 20:27 says, &ldquo;The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all the innermost parts of the inner being.&rdquo; This means that the spirit of man was created by God to be a lamp that can search man&rsquo;s inner being. God&rsquo;s lamp is within man, and it can search man daily. The operation of the conscience is like the shining of a lamp. When this lamp shines, we see our faults and know that we are wrong toward our parents, spouse, neighbors, relatives, and children. Such a discovery is the issue of the shining of the conscience in our human spirit, because the spirit of man is a lamp. The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, and this lamp searches the innermost parts of man&rsquo;s inner being.</p>
<p>This proves that there is a God in the universe and that God is Spirit. The spirit within man is the organ to contact God and to search man on God&rsquo;s behalf. This is a clear teaching in the Bible that everyone can know and experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT ENTERING INTO MAN&rsquo;S SPIRIT<br />
TO BE MAN&rsquo;S EVERYTHING</h2>
<p>God is Spirit, and He made a human spirit in us so that He could enter into our spirit. Our spirit is His vessel, and He is our content. His entering into us can be compared to pouring water into a cup. Without water a cup is empty; with water a cup is full. God wants to enter into us to be our content. When we are filled with God in our spirit, we will be satisfied. This is the reason that new believers are zealous for the Lord, love Him, and are willing to forfeit their earthly treasures.</p>
<p>Those who believe in Jesus have received something. We have not merely believed in a religion, nor have we merely accepted some doctrines. We have received the true and living Spirit. The Spirit has entered into us with unspeakable blessings. When we suffer, He is our comfort. When we are lonely, He is with us. When we are weak, He is our strength. He does not merely resolve our outward problems; He is our inner joy. Those who have God are at peace, are joyful, and are satisfied, no matter what their outward circumstances are. We do not believe in a religion; we believe in the living Jesus.</p>
<p>The Bible is very clear: if we are willing to repent and believe in the true God, Jesus Christ, He, as the true and living Spirit, will enter into our spirit, and our spirit will be born anew (John 3:3, 6-7). We were born of our parents to be human beings, but since we have repented and believed in Jesus, He is in our spirit. When Jesus came into us, we received another life. This is regeneration. We have been born again in our spirit; our spirit is filled with God.</p>
<p>When the Chinese sages spoke of developing the bright virtue, they were referring to developing merely the conscience. But we who have believed in Jesus have received God, who is the source and reality of every virtue. He has enlivened our spirit, enlightened our inner being, and filled us.</p>
<p>This is the significance of our salvation. Salvation is the living Spirit entering into our human spirit. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; The Lord God is Jesus, who is now the life-giving Spirit. He wants to be joined with our human spirit. He enters into those who believe in Him. His presence gives a bountiful and all-inclusive supply. If we need love, His presence is our love. If we need obedience and faithfulness, His presence is our obedience and faithfulness. If we need comfort, His presence is our comfort. Whatever we need, He is, because He is the source and reality of every virtue. When we have Him, we have the reality of human life, we know the meaning of human life, and we know our destiny in the future. This is not superstition, nor is it a matter of psychology.</p>
<p>This is the reality of the gospel of Christ: God created man as a vessel with a spirit to contain Him. When we received Him, He entered into us to regenerate us, and we experienced a fundamental and intrinsic change in our life and living. This is the experience of regeneration and salvation. The Lord Jesus is now in us as our life and our reality.</p>
<p>It is our hope that more people would humbly repent, believe in, and receive the Lord Jesus so that they may be blessed together with us. If everyone would receive the Lord Jesus, individuals and families would be blessed, and societies and nations would also be blessed. God Himself is the blessing. He is almighty and able to hear our prayers, but He is also the Lord of life in order to enter into us as the Spirit to be the reality of our life in our spirit. May the Lord bless us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
