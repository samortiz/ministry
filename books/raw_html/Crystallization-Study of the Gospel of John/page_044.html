<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Shepherd of the Flock of God</H2><P>Christ, with the commission He received of God to accomplish God's eternal economy, has to be the Shepherd of the flock of God, which is His Body that consummates the New Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Door</H2><P>To be such a Shepherd He has to be the door for the release of so many sheep of God's flock in Judaism. He was also the door for the Old Testament saints such as Abraham (John 8:56) and even Moses to enter in through their expectation of the coming Messiah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Pasture</H2><P>Now after setting them free from the Judaistic fold, He feeds them with Himself as the rich pasture of life. This pasture equals the feasts in chapters six and seven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Flock</H2><P>This is for them to be flocked together with God's other sheep (the Gentile believers) to be His one organic Body to arrive at the ultimate goal of God's economy&#151;the New Jerusalem. If we feast on Christ as the pasture, we like to be flocked together with others. The more we enjoy Christ, the more we like to fellowship with others. If we feed upon Christ as our pasture in the morning, enjoying Him as the feast, we will eagerly go to the meeting in the evening.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. The Resurrection and the Life</H2><P>John 10 is on shepherding, and John 11 shows that shepherding must be with resurrection life (v. 25). If we are natural, full of the natural view, natural philosophy, and natural logic, we cannot feed others. We will be dead, and that death will kill the meetings. If we are persons in resurrection, we are in life. Actually resurrection and life are one. They are "twin brothers." When we are in life, we become persons who shepherd others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Martha Counting on the Matter of Time</H2><P>At the death of Lazarus, his sister Martha counted on the matter of time, not on the person of Christ. She said to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died" (John 11:21). That meant that Martha was asking the Lord why He had not come earlier. To her understanding, whether her brother would die or live was a matter of time. She did not see that Christ Himself, the person, is the resurrection.</P>
