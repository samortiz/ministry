<h2 class=head2>The Law of the Mind</h2><p>There is yet another law, the third law, which is the law of the mind. Romans 7:23 says, “But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind.” We should not consider that the law of the mind is the same as the law of God given through Moses. The Mosaic law is outside of us, whereas the law of the mind is within us. Because the mind is a part of the soul, the law of the mind is the law in our soul. The two laws in verse 23 are subjective laws, not the objective law. One is subjectively in the members of our body, and the other is subjectively in our mind. These two laws, one in our members and the other in our mind, war against one another.<p>As we have seen, with every kind of life there is a corresponding law. Since the human life in our soul was created by God, it is good. Therefore, the law of this life must also be good. Since this created life is in the soul, the law of good is in the soul. Therefore, it is called the law of the mind because the mind is a part of the soul. This law of good in our mind, the law of the good life, corresponds with the law of God. When the law of God outside of us demands that we do something good, the law in our mind always responds. However, whenever the law of the mind responds to the law of God in trying to do good, the law in our members rises up to frustrate and war against the law of the mind. The law of God and the law in the mind “love” one another, but they can never “marry” because the law in our members is the enemy that frustrates them by warring against the law in the mind.<p>The warring in Romans 7 pertains to unbelievers as well as to believers, because in Romans 7 there is nothing yet related to salvation. In God’s creation we obtained the created human life in our soul. Within this created life, which is good, there is the law of good. When man fell, however, he received the life of Satan into his body. Within this evil life there is the law of evil which is the law of sin and death dwelling in the members of man’s body.<p>If you have ever seen opium smokers, you will be very clear about this matter. I saw them when I was young. In their mind the opium smokers were convinced that they should not smoke, and they made up their mind never to smoke. However, after a few hours the drug addiction in their body would rise up. They could not stand against that addiction. There was a law in their members, the law of addiction. No matter how hard they struggled against this addiction, they eventually were carried away captive to the smoking house. Paul said, “But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members” (v. 23). Even an opium smoker realizes that there is something in his members that wars against something in his mind and carries him away as a captive to the law of addiction in his members. All manner of lusts are also addictions in the members of the body. Therefore, the Scriptures tell us that lusts are related to the flesh.
