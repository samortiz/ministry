   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are several points connected with the matter of speaking, and we should take note of them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, let us note before the Lord the kind of talk we hear all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kind of talk we hear determines the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people will not tell you some things because they know that you are not like them, and it would be useless to say that thing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a person readily shares certain things with you, he does it because he knows that you are of the same kind, and that such things will produce a certain effect on you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can know yourself by noting the things that people relate to you all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, let us observe the kind of words we most readily believe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That which we are prone to credit reveals our own disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A certain kind of people will tend to believe certain kinds of words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We hear things wrongly and believe things lightly because we are blind; we are not in God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as we are short of light or void of light, we fall into error.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The direction of our ear and the degree of our gullibility often betrays our sick condition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people believe others' words even before they ever hear anything from them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then when they hear something, they rejoice over what they have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The words may be incredible and ludicrous, yet a person can still be convinced that they are true.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the kind of words that we believe show the kind of person that we are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Third, next to listening and believing, there is also the matter of passing words on to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is similar in nature to the first two points.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One may hear and believe a certain kind of words, but if he decides to pass them on to others, this indicates that he is not only the kind of person being portrayed by the words, that is, a person in darkness, but he is also willing to make others just like himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His whole being is involved with the words he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In listening, others are speaking; in believing, others' words are received; and in passing on words, one's whole being is put into the words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many people love to speak and pass on words.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because of this, they lose all their power and are no longer able to be a proper minister of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fourth, there are the inaccurate words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people are very inaccurate in the things they say.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One minute they say one thing and the next minute they say something else.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This type of person is "double-tongued" 1 Tim 3:8 ; they cannot serve as deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They say one thing to one person and another thing to another person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They say something to a man's face and turn around and say something else behind his back.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such ones are useless in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers and sisters, if we cannot bridle our tongue, how can we control ourselves and how can we serve the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man must bridle himself and buffet his body before he can serve the Lord in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have a terrible member in our body our tongue, which always leads us into trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Inaccuracy in words, being double-tongued, and vacillation in our statements are marks of weakness in character.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who have such habits have no standing, and they are powerless before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They vacillate back and forth because they are too easy going and uncertain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such behavior points to extreme weakness in one's character!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Lord's work, inaccurate words are a very sobering matter, and we must deal with them.</S>
