<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Tabernacle Being in Ruins<br>and the Ark Wandering,<br>Typifying the Desolation of the Church</H2><P>The visible church today is the tabernacle; it is already in ruins. At the same time, the temple is not yet manifest. In God's eyes, the church described in Ephesians 2 as God's habitation in the Holy Spirit is a fact. But in actuality, the church has not been fully manifested yet; it is still in its progressing stage. In 1924, we spoke of the history of the ark. The ark of the covenant was always advancing. First it passed through the river Jordan. Then it reached Shiloh (Josh. 18:1). At the time the Israelites went to war with the Philistines, the two sons of Eli had sinned, and Eli himself had become foolish and corrupt. He knew very well the reason the Israelites were defeated. Yet he still tried to use the ark to fight for them, with the hope that through the ark they would win the victory. But the Israelites failed. The ark was captured to the land of the Philistines, and it remained in the house of Dagon (1 Sam. 5:2). Later God brought in a curse, and the Philistines returned the ark on a cart drawn by cows (1 Sam. 4&#151;6).</P><P>At that time, Samuel was raised up to fulfill his ministry. He was still a child and was girded with a small ephod (1 Sam. 2:18). Here was a minister who was set apart for the kingdom. The ark represents Christ. Wherever the ark was, there was the presence of Christ. The ark was known as the ark of the testimony. It was the center of God's testimony. Without the ark, the tabernacle was empty. The tabernacle was meaningful only when it had the ark inside it. After the ark was taken away from the tabernacle in Shiloh (1 Sam. 4:17), it never returned to the tabernacle. It continued to wander, until it was received into the temple when the temple was finished (1 Kings 8:1-11). Before David, there was Saul. At that time, Shiloh was already rejected. The ark did not return to the tabernacle, but remained rather in the house of Obed-edom (2 Sam 6:10) until the time of David, when David welcomed the ark into Jerusalem (2 Sam. 6:12-15). Jeremiah 7:12 and 14 speak of how God dealt with Shiloh, and Psalms 78:60 and 1 Samuel 4:3 speak of how the ark had left the tabernacle. Second Chronicles 5 speaks of how the ark was returned to the temple. God dealt with Shiloh not in the way of burning it down with fire, nor in the way of destroying the people there, but by removing the ark. To have a tabernacle without an ark&#151;this is judgment, desolation, and punishment. Shiloh had the outward form of the tabernacle only; the ark was no longer there. It is like Christianity having only the name of the church, but the central testimony of the church is lost and God's testimony is removed.</P><P>When Solomon became king, he went to Gibeon to pray for wisdom in the tabernacle. Later, when he received the wisdom, he went to the ark (1 Kings 3:15). However, according to 1 Kings 3:4 and 2 Chronicles 1:3, the Gibeonites still made sacrifices and sought for God at the tabernacle. But from the day Solomon left the tabernacle, he never went back. Although in Gibeon there was still the outward human worship, all those who had received wisdom would never go back to the tabernacle. Those who had received wisdom went with the ark.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REALITY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Normal Condition of the Church<br>at the Beginning&#151;Bearing a Testimony<br>of Oneness in All the Places</H2><P>The church on earth today is one. Those who are in the church are men who are separated from the world. Under normal circumstances, every brother and sister should be serving God; this should be their proper occupation. Every one should be a consecrated one, and everyone should have everything in common. Under such a proper living, the gifted ministries such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, as listed in Ephesians 4, are produced. Although these gifted ones are scattered in different places, they are still in the same church. This is like electric current being one, yet transmitted throughout many places. Although the intensity of light may be different from one house to the other, the electricity itself is one. The light expressed in different places is different, but the nature of the electricity is the same. This is the same with the church. Although the churches in the various localities are different as far as their localities are concerned, there is nevertheless only one church. The church exists for the testimony of oneness. When we say the "local church," our emphasis is the church and not the local-ness. The life that all the churches possess is a life of oneness. For this reason all the churches should be one among themselves. Although there were the manifested churches in Corinth, Ephesus, and other places, they were all one church. This is the normal situation.</P>
