Not Outward Decoration</H2><P>[This understanding of regeneration shatters the natural concept. Using the illustration of a dog receiving a human life, we see that the natural concept is merely that a dog can be cleansed and beautified. In principle, many Christians are occupied with cleansing people and beautifying them, instead of helping them receive the divine life and nature through regeneration. God's way is not merely to wash us, beautify us, and decorate us outwardly. His intention in His economy is to regenerate us, to cause us to be sons of God born of Him. This matter is unspeakably great.</P><P>There is no doubt that God's salvation includes cleansing by the redeeming blood of Christ. In a very real sense, we, the saved ones, have been cleansed by God. Being cleansed, however, is not the highlight of God's salvation. The highlight is that God has regenerated us, that He has actually imparted His life and nature into us to make us His sons. Now we are not God's sons-in-law&#151;we are the sons of God in life. Certainly there is no greater wonder in the whole universe than that sinful men by being regenerated can become sons of God. Many today are seeking wonders and miracles. But they do not realize that there is no greater miracle than regeneration. By regeneration fallen people become sons of God. In His salvation God has made us, fallen sinners, His divine sons.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Living as Sons of God</H2><P>[Not many Christians realize that they are sons of God and that God wants them to live the life of a son of God. After they are saved, most Christians try to improve themselves or to do something to please God. In their efforts to improve the natural man or to do something to please God, the vast majority of the Lord's people are missing the mark of God's economy. God's salvation is for His economy, and His economy is not a matter of ethics. Rather, by His salvation according to His economy, God has regenerated us by the divine life that we may be His sons and live as sons of God. God's goal is not simply that we improve our behavior and thereby do good instead of evil. It is not God's purpose merely to have a number of good people. God's desire is that we live as sons of God. God wants us not simply to be cleansed. He wants us to live as sons of God. If we would do this, we need to receive the Spirit of God. We have been born of the Spirit to receive the Spirit.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE CONSTANT RECEIVING OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>[Galatians 3:5 says, "He therefore Who is supplying to you the Spirit and doing works of power among you, is it by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?" This verse indicates that God continues to supply us the Spirit. We may use electricity as an illustration. After electricity has been installed in a building, electricity is supplied continually to the building. Likewise, after God regenerated us by His Spirit to make us His sons, He has been continually supplying to us the Spirit. Nothing is more crucial than the constant receiving of the Spirit.]</P><P>Instead of trying to behave religiously we should pray, ["Lord Jesus, I open myself to You. I thank You that I have been born of God, born of the all-inclusive Spirit. Lord, this Spirit is still transmitting something of You into my being. I thank You, Lord, for this marvelous transmission."] Then we will be the sons of God living by and enjoying the divine dispensing of the Triune God. Hallelujah for regeneration!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>Regeneration is the initiation of the divine dispensing. When God's Spirit enters into a person, his spirit is made alive; he is born of the Spirit. This is to be born again. It is a spiritual birth in addition to our natural birth. Man needs regeneration not only because he has been corrupted but even the more because he lacks God's life. Regeneration is entirely different from the natural concept of outwardly decorating people. Regeneration causes people to receive the very life and nature of God and makes them sons of God. The believers should continue to live by this life which is transmitted by the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>What happens to man's spirit at regeneration?</li><li>Why does the Bible refer to regeneration as being "born again"?</li><li>What are the two aspects of man's need of regeneration?</li><li>How does regeneration relate to God's purpose?</li><li>How can we see from Genesis that Adam needed regeneration even before he sinned?</li><li>What is the natural or religious concept about changing a person?
