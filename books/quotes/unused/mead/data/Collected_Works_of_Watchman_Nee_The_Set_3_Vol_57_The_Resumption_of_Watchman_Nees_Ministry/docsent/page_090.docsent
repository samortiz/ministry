   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SERVING GOD BEING THE HIGHEST GLORY God Honoring Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Granting Us the Favor</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was in England I heard of a brother by the name of C. A. Coates.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Someone once gave one of his books to the Queen of England.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Queen read the book and was helped by it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, Coates had written eight books.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I was in England, I asked the British brothers, "Since Coates has eight books, why would he not give the other seven books to the Queen?''</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The brothers did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They acted as if I had said something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later, I asked some other people and learned that a common English person could not give a book to the Queen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even if you tried to give her a book, she might not necessarily accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Consecration is God honoring us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not a favor we grant to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, it is God's acceptance of us and of our possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, it is God's honor to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are not granting Him a favor; He is granting us a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For God to accept persons such as we is the greatest privilege He can grant to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I kneel before God and He sends a fire to consume the sacrifice, it is His favor to me in accepting my service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man thinks that he is sacrificing himself by consecrating to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Little does he realize that God's accepting him is His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why do we have to calculate so much?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to learn to push our way through to serve Him, to crawl before Him, and to kneel before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A man should learn to humble himself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not begging you to go to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, you should beg to go to Him yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Serving God Being to Our Profit and Being</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>the Result of the Lord's Dynamic Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The China Textile Corporation no longer dares to issue any more shares because they will be sold within half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today the blind ones are not the ones who cannot see; the blind ones are the ones who do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our only fear should be that we give too little to God, that God will not accept what we give to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is our consecration a profit for God, or is it a profit for us?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Is it a favor we render to God, or a favor God renders to us?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we come to God, the only thing we should fear is that God will reject and deny us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should only fear that we give to God too little, that He will not accept us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who know God will say, "Lord, here is some more.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here is some more.''</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who have once seen the Lord can give half of what they have to the poor without any complaint.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord said to Zaccheus, "Today salvation has come to this house'' Luke 19:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today many people do not realize the greatness of the Lord's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why they encounter difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Salvation not only saves our soul; it means that we are delivered from everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us remember the story of our burial.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Why were we baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Baptism is a declaration that we have been separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Merely inviting three or five people to come and serve will not solve the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we need today is for the whole Body to rise up for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The demand for the co-workers in the days ahead is quite severe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The need is also very great.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For the sake of China's gospel, for the sake of the co-workers going on, we need a fresh consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE NEED IN SERVICE AND THE WAY OF SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If I had a hundred billion dollars today, I could distribute it all for proper use within a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our work needs money.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From now on we have to work with a goal and with proper arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the co-workers are living for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We ask all the brothers and sisters with a job to offer up themselves also.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have to work in coordination and in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>None of us is for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must live for the Lord and for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot have part of the people offering up themselves, while part of the people are not offering up themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need all the brothers and sisters to offer up themselves and to live for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who are teaching or who are in business have to offer up everything for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord has to do what He did in the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are not afraid of believing in the first-century gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are not afraid of preaching the first-century gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are not afraid of acting according to the first-century gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we would rise up as a whole Body, the whole of China will be taken; no one will be able to withstand us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we do not believe in a thorough gospel and if we do not have a thorough consecration, it will be difficult for the Lord to use us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The gospel has been preached in China for over a century, but it has been restricted to the coastal regions.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Not much has been done in the inland regions.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have wasted twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we are not faithful again, we will be set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A STRONG TESTIMONY PRODUCING A STRONG RESULT</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the first century men were not able to preach the gospel freely.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They did not go to the church buildings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At that time men believed because they saw the gospel and saw the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Christians at that time were hiding in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When they were put on the fiery stakes, they were seen and heard for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The effect of seeing the gospel is much stronger than that of hearing the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This kind of gospel shows men that salvation is not cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The prayer of the martyrs during those hours became their gospel messages.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Historians tell us that the believers in Rome were killed first, and the ones who were not killed were exiled.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Today Christianity is weak in others because it is weak in us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>During the first century, men were afraid, yet they kept coming.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Today lukewarm Christians are useless ones.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>On the one hand, the testimonies of the early believers frightened many people away.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But on the other hand, this kind of gospel also made many frightened of running away.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Where there is the apostles' service, there is the apostles' blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Today the whole responsibility rests on our work.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If the Lord cannot get through among us, He cannot get through anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The past twenty years, while we were praying and seeking, the Lord was preparing us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, if the young ruler came today, he might not stay any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Today we have to offer up all our money, time, and heart.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Only then will the Lord have a way, and only then can we reach our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We should not allow money to choke our heart, and we should not allow it to block man's way to God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>All the brothers and sisters have to participate in the spiritual work, and all possessions have to be offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we do this, the Lord will have a free way among us.</S>
