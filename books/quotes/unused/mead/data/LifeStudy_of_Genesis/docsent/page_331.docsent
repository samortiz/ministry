   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a The Family the Group</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider these six points in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Based upon the principle that everything in the book of Genesis is a seed, we may say that Abraham's tent, in which he had intimate fellowship with God on the human level, was a miniature of the tabernacle which God commanded Abraham's descendants to build as His dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Abraham's tent was the seed, and the tabernacle erected in the wilderness by the children of Israel was the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The temple built in the good land of Canaan was a further development of this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today's church, as the real dwelling of God on earth, is the fulfillment of what has been portrayed in the Old Testament by Abraham's tent, the tabernacle, and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be the ultimate harvest of this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 21:3 says that "the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall tabernacle with them."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, in Genesis 18 we have the seed, and in Revelation 21 we have the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same principle, during the time of Abraham and Lot, God had a people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His people were composed of two families, the families of Abraham and of Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was a seed, a miniature, of God's people in the following ages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Firstly, the children of Israel were the development of the seed of God's people, and now the church today is the continuation of this development.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, in the New Jerusalem we shall see that all the redeemed ones throughout the generations will be the full harvest of God's people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once again we have the seed, the development, and the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this we see that what is present with the seed should also be found with the development.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the beginning, Abraham's family and Lot's family, being God's people, were one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At a certain time, however, division came in and they were divided.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When they were one, they were not a group; they were the people of God, God's one people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When division came in, it produced a free group.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That ancient free group was the seed and the miniature of today's free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The free groups among God's people today are actually a further development of this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The division which was sown by Lot was developed after the time of Solomon when the children of Israel were divided and a free group was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That free group, the nation of Israel, was never recognized by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God only recognized Judah because Judah was on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The principle is the same in the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The whole church should be God's one people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the early days, the church was uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But division after division came in, producing many free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We praise the Lord that this division will not continue into the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It will be terminated by the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>1 Apart from God's Witness and Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have seen that Lot's separation from Abraham was the seed both of division and of today's free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who was the cause of that division?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The fault was not on Abraham's side; it was on Lot's side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The members of Lot's family might have argued, "Aren't we also God's people?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why do you, the members of Abraham's family, always say that you are the people of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yes, Lot's family was a part of the people of God, but they had left God's witness and testimony, which were Abraham and what he was testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's witness and testimony were at the tent of Abraham by the oaks of Mamre in Hebron, not with Lot in the city of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In chapters eighteen and nineteen we see that God and the two angels were happy to stay with Abraham, enjoying dinner and intimate fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when the angels went to the wicked city of Sodom, God did not go with them; He remained with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>While both groups were God's people, where was God's presence?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only with Abraham's family.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's presence was with Abraham's family because his family was the typical people of God and had the proper standing of God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although Lot was one of God's people, he was not on the proper ground by the oaks of Mamre in Hebron; he was in Sodom, on the ground of division and free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All God's people, being His family, should dwell by the oaks of Mamre in Hebron, where God can pay them a friendly and intimate visit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here we can see the difference between the church and the free groups: all the free groups are God's people, but the church is by the "oaks of Mamre" in "Hebron," continually enjoying God's intimate presence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What then about the free groups?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As it was with the case of Lot's family, God does not meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are His people, and He cares for them and does not forget them, but His presence is not with them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the angels left for Sodom to rescue Lot and his family, God's presence was with Abraham, His dear friend.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Where are you with Abraham's family in Hebron or with Lot's free group in Sodom?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Does not the Bible say that Lot was a righteous man?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yes, we are clearly told in 2 Peter 2:7 and 8 that Lot was righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Are not the people in the free groups saved?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Certainly they are.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But look at the situation: the people in the free groups are in a place which is under God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is clear in the enlightenment of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suppose you were alive during the days of Abraham and Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>With which group would you have been?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps you would have said, "You say that Lot's group is a division.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Isn't Abraham's group also a division?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Neither Abraham's group nor Lot's group is the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They both are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why do you make so much of the difference between Abraham's family and Lot's family when both of them are God's people?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since both are God's people, today I will be with Lot and tomorrow I will visit Abraham."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although you might stay with Lot, God would not.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This makes a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Besides the family which was on the ground where they could have intimate fellowship with God, there was a free group.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today's situation is a further development of this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Be honest and fair about the free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Is there the testimony of God among them?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No, God is not expressed in the free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They do whatever they like, and there is no witness or testimony with them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Lot's family became such a free group because it was apart from Abraham and what he was testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If I had been Lot, having the light which we have today, I would have said, "Uncle Abraham, even if you force me to leave you, I would refuse to go.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you don't like me, I would still embrace and kiss you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I would stay with you because you are God's witness and because the testimony of God is with you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I will never forsake this testimony."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should have this attitude today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although we may not be happy with the brothers in the church, we should say, "Brothers, although I don't feel happy with you and although you may mistreat me, I will never leave God's testimony."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The source, the root, of the problem of the ancient free group was its departing from God's witness and testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As many of us can testify, when we departed from the denominations, we were happy and felt as though we were in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But it is quite a different matter to leave the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you forsake the church, your joy will disappear and will not return until you return to God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I do not say this lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Without exception, those who have left the church have lost their joy.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Once a person leaves the church, it is very difficult for him to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Look at Lot: although he was rescued after the slaughter of the kings, he refused to return to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even after he had been delivered from the destruction of Sodom, he still did not go back to him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Later on, we shall see that Lot still had his self-choice.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>That we are joyful after leaving the denominations but joyless after leaving the church proves what is the church, which has God's presence, and what is a denomination, which does not have God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Although we may not be able to discern the difference between them by our thought, we can discern it by the sense of life deep in our spirit.</S>
