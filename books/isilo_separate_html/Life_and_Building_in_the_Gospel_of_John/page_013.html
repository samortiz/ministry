<p>The proof that God has entered into us as the Word and touched us is that we are inwardly full of light. Forgive me for saying this, but when I contact the brothers and sisters, it is not difficult to know whether or not the light of life is shining in them. I grieve for the saints when I do not sense the light from the Word in them.</p>
<p>Some are in darkness because of their corrupt nature. For example, a person&rsquo;s hateful heart may cause his being to be in darkness. Pride, self-complacence, and self-righteousness also result in darkness. Nevertheless, even a small crack in our inner being will enable God&rsquo;s word to come in and God&rsquo;s light to shine. Others are in darkness because of their unwillingness to consecrate themselves; instead, they argue with God. When God requires something in them, they calculate the cost and are unwilling to pay the price. They want to win, and they want God to lose. Their &ldquo;victory,&rdquo; however, becomes an inward veil that shuts out God&rsquo;s light. Others experience darkness because they refuse to obey God. When God wants them to take a step forward, they refuse, and their refusal becomes a veil.</p>
<p>Although improper things certainly cause us to fall into darkness, some brothers and sisters are so proper that they also have no light. In their humility and meekness there is no shining of light. I am concerned for these brothers and sisters. Sometimes I pray to the Lord, asking, &ldquo;What can be done? These brothers and sisters are so good, but they have no light.&rdquo; When I contact such ones, they are truly humble, meek, obedient, and considerate; they are good, but there is no inward shining. Although it seems as if they are familiar with every word that is spoken in a message, they do not have an open mind that would allow the words to shine in them. Some may say to themselves, &ldquo;How can a humble person like me not be inwardly bright? How can a good person like me be without light? How can a considerate person like me be inwardly dark?&rdquo; In truth, many &ldquo;humble&rdquo; persons are exceedingly proud. They do not think that they have any problems, and they never question themselves. Believing themselves to be fine, they are inwardly proud and complacent. Such ones have no light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIGHT GIVING MAN A SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>When we have no light, we are dejected and dead. But if we live in the light, we are bright and full of inward vitality. The key to our condition is whether or not we have the Lord&rsquo;s word, the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Whenever the Lord speaks to us, He not only makes us living but also causes us to be full of light. When He shines within us, He fills us with a sense of life, that is, feelings related to life.</p>
<p>Before being saved, a person may argue with his wife and even feel justified and gratified when he vents his anger. However, after he is saved and the Lord is living within him, the more he quarrels, the less he is gratified. Instead, he will lose his inward sense of peace from the Lord. If he continues to argue with his wife, he will begin to lose even the sense of not being peaceful, and it will be as if he has reverted back to his condition before his salvation. Losing the sense of life is related to having no light. Since the sense of life produces light, the loss of this sense indicates that we are in darkness.</p>
<p>With the exception of avoiding great immoral and obvious sins, some Christians have no restrictions related to other matters; they can do almost anything. Nevertheless, these Christians do not have the presence of God or enjoy fellowship with the Lord. They are dull, numb, and have no inward sense of life. When such persons are asked about how they feel, they say, &ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo; However, this really means that they feel nothing. Their response is an indication that they have no fellowship with the Lord inwardly and, therefore, no light. Such ones may be weighed down with wrongdoings, yet they feel nothing. Feeling nothing is the same as being in darkness. They may even come to a meeting and hear a message, but the message will not enter into them to become the living word.</p>
<p>Normal Christians live before the Lord continuously and fellowship with the Lord daily. They are living, and they are full of light and the sense of life. They have a feeling related to the sense of life when they speak too strongly to others or when they discuss others&rsquo; affairs in a critical and judgmental manner. As soon as a thought enters their mind, they have a sense that this thought is offensive to God. This sense comes from the light that is shining in the deepest part of their being.</p>
<p>If we would live in the light, our sense will become more positive and deeper in regard to God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, to the Body of Christ, to the need of the church, and to God&rsquo;s present way. Furthermore, the Bible will become living and open to us when we read the Word. When we are living, the Bible will be living to us; when we are full of light, the Bible will be full of light to us.</p>
<p>When the light in a room is intensified, everything in the room can be seen more clearly, even the slightest amount of dust. When there is a dim light, many stains are obscured. When there is insufficient light in a room, many things escape our notice. The more our inner being is full of light, the more our inward feelings will be keen, detailed, thorough, meticulous, and transparent. Thus, our prayer, our reading of the Bible, our meetings, and even our mutual fellowship with the brothers and sisters will be full of the shining of light. If we do not experience the shining of light in our meetings and in our fellowship with the brothers and sisters, we can only be in darkness. In such a condition, we are merely &ldquo;service-goers&rdquo; in religion. God does not want &ldquo;service-goers.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING LIGHT</h2>
<p>In order for a person to receive light, he must be willing to consider his condition before the Lord. If he is willing to not trust in himself and does not think too highly of himself, the Spirit will have the ground to care for him, visit him, and speak to him.</p>
<p>God wants man to consider his ways (Hag. 1:7) and even to ask, &ldquo;What is my condition? Do I know God? Do I know God&rsquo;s heart? Do I know God&rsquo;s eternal plan? Do I know the Body of Christ? Do I know the Lord&rsquo;s way in this age? Do I know where His church is going? Do I give God the ground in my being? Do I let God examine me according to His government? Do I let God touch every point related to me?&rdquo; We must examine ourselves on every point and not trust in ourselves. If we do this, the God of mercy, the omnipresent God, the gracious God who cares for man, will speak to us. In His word there will be life, and this life will be the light of men. We will immediately sense the shining of light everywhere, and we will be full of feelings related to the sense of life. We will feel that the way we treat our wife and children is wrong. We will feel that we are wrong toward God and men. We will feel that we are wrong in our career and in our finances. Whereas we were previously ignorant of God&rsquo;s heart, we will have a keen sense of life that brings in God&rsquo;s shining light, a light that exposes what is not of God and reveals what is of God, and whereas before we had no feelings, now we will be full of feelings.</p>
<p>It is easy to think that our situation is more or less acceptable to God. It is easy to have a frivolous attitude when talking about God and God&rsquo;s way. Being in such a condition is an indication that we are lacking in discernment and that our sense of life is dull. This dullness is caused by a lack of light that comes from a shortage of life due to a lack of God&rsquo;s speaking. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may see that being a Christian is not merely a matter of being pious, being well-behaved, worshipping God, or serving God. Being a Christian is a matter of being full of light and being enlivened with God&rsquo;s life through His word.</p>
<p>The living God is within us, and He is speaking within us. He is speaking to us concerning small things as well as great things. Sometimes His speaking involves principles, and at other times His speaking concerns specific and detailed matters. He speaks of matters related to His household as well as matters related to our household. He speaks concerning the brothers and sisters as well as ourselves. His speaking within us makes us bright and living. As a result, we are full of feelings inwardly; that is, we have feelings related to everything. This is what it means to be a Christian. God is the Word and in the Word is life and this life is the light of men.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
