   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SANCTIFICATION FOR SONSHIP IN OUR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may wonder what sanctification has to do with our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to realize that sanctification for sonship is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not a once-for-all matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every day we have to remember that God the Spirit is sanctifying us for God to impart more of His holy nature and holy life into our being to cause us to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all have to grow in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we need to consider how we can grow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order for us to grow physically, we need the life within plus the nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A young child has inherited a life from his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, his parents have imparted their human life into this child.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the mother feeds him every day, and he grows with the nourishment in the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In principle it is the same in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We were born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has imparted Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we need to grow by being nourished in the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our birth is a beginning, not a graduation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After our birth, we need to grow in the life of Christ, in the divine life, in the eternal life, with the proper nourishment in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both sanctification and the sonship are always carried out by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why Ephesians 1:3 calls this a spiritual blessing, a blessing by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today we must learn to live by the Spirit, to act according to the Spirit, to have our being altogether by the Spirit, with the Spirit, and according to the Spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as we have our being by the Spirit and act according to the Spirit, we are ready to grow in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we need some nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can be nourished in these three ways: by reading the holy Word, by listening to the spiritual speaking, and by coming to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This nourishment causes us to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am concerned that many dear ones among us are seeking after the Lord, but they still are not on the way of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are driving a car for a long distance, we need to find the freeway and get on it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once we get on the freeway, we have to be careful about the direction we take.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we get on the right freeway with the right direction, then our driving is okay.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to get on the way of the growth in the divine life in the right direction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We still need some revelation to see the right way to grow in the divine life according to the New Testament teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to grow, we must deal with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must get ourselves right with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must have our entire being in the Spirit, and walk, behave, and act according to the Spirit all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the parents are with their children, they have to behave themselves according to the Spirit in order to be kept in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times the parents are too free and unrestricted in what they say to their children.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They may be afraid of making mistakes when they talk to others, but they do not have any care when they speak to their children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not say anything according to our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, we have to be regulated, corrected, and adjusted by saying everything and doing everything according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is the Spirit who sanctifies us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is the Spirit who begets us that we may be born of God John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God chose us to be sanctified unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be sanctified unto sonship is altogether a matter by the Spirit, in the Spirit, and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am concerned when I see a number of dear saints who have been in the recovery for many years with no growth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although they may meet, read the Bible, and listen to the messages, they do not care for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead of taking care of the Spirit when they speak, they freely gossip and criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although they say that they love the Lord, love the recovery, and love the church life, they do not care a bit for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to take care of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today this Spirit, who is wrapped up with sanctification and with God's sonship, is in our spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we desire to take care of the Spirit, we should first take care of our spirit.</S>
