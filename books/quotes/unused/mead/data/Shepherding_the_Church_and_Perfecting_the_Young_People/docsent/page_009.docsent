   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Elders Needing to Labor in the Word and Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible says that the elders should shepherd the flock of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Timothy 5:17 says, Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse says that the elders who lead well are those who labor in word and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, to shepherd with feeding is to teach with the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The elders in a local church should bear the responsibility of shepherding and feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This can be compared to parents bearing responsibility in a family.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elders should not excuse themselves and say that they do not have the gift of preaching the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a thought is the influence of traditional Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we first began meeting as the Lord s testimony, we were greatly helped by the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were the first group of believers to recover the church life, but they paid too much attention to the gift of preaching the word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In their consideration a person could not give a message unless he had the gift of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we have clearly seen 1 Corinthians 14:31, which says, You can all prophesy one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we should uproot the concept of not having the gift of preaching the word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to learn how to use God s word to feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not Depending on Full-time Serving Ones</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether you have the gift of prophesying does not matter, because 1 Corinthians 14:31 says, You can all prophesy one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This can be compared to a married sister who must cook even though she says that she does not know how to cook.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1962 I went to the United States, and after being there for ten months, I was able to cook even though I had never cooked previously.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I had to cook because I had to feed myself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Initially, I ate meals that others prepared, but as a result, I suffered from an ulcer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was the result of my inability to cook.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when I began to eat my cooking, my ulcer was cured.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I give this example to say that we have depended too long on others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The elders in the local churches depend on the co-workers and exalt them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The co-workers are like famous chefs whom we invite to our homes to cook for us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, in terms of the skills in giving a message, some co-workers may be far inferior to the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that we will be enlightened to see our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The concept that whoever serves full time is able to preach the word and whoever does not serve full time is not able to preach the word is erroneous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Speaking to Meet the Need</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is correct to say that we can all prophesy one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the ability to give messages is not the result of a change in status; it does not come when a person begins to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A brother does not gain an ability to preach the word simply because he begins to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are several elders who are very capable of giving good messages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As soon as they begin to speak, they hit the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the elders are willing to endeavor, their speaking will be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not give messages in order to receive people s praise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The movements of a boxer are not to gain people s applause; rather, his sole aim is to deliver a blow to his opponent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not want to give lengthy and eloquent messages that are ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We want to give messages that are effective because they touch people s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our speaking needs to be effective.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not care whether the message is appealing or grammatical.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We care about touching people s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once after D. L. Moody, a prevailing American evangelist, preached the gospel, he was approached by a learned person who was in the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This person told Moody that he had used mistaken grammar in his message.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Moody was not an educated person; in his youth he was an apprentice in his uncle s shoe store.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But after the Lord gained him, he was fervent to work for the Lord by preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moody then suggested that this person preach the gospel with his correct grammar to see how many would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moody was very clear that he preached the word not to teach English grammar but to lead people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He cared only for people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some brothers speak with an accent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is difficult to change.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nevertheless, as long as they are willing to practice, they will be able to give a message that is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some brothers use beautiful words, but their speaking does not touch people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some brothers articulate their words and are eloquent and logical, but their speaking produces no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They may remain in a place for two years, but the place remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are others whose messages are ordinary but effective.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our goal is to give effective messages.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, the elders should not expect the co-workers to bear the responsibility of ministering the word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They should not expect the co-workers to meet the need of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the other hand, the co-workers must have a heart for the church and give messages that are effective.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Otherwise, their speaking is not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The elders must learn to speak the word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I do not say this to depreciate the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I say this because the localities rely too much on the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to be delivered and to change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do not attend meetings in order to listen to beautiful messages, and the full-time workers are not the only ones who should give messages.</S>
