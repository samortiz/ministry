<p>Matthew 5:21 through 26 concerns anger. In verses 21 and 22 the Lord said, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said to the ancients, &lsquo;You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.&rsquo; But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment.&rdquo; Concerning anger, the Old Testament law requires only that we not murder, but the kingdom of the heavens requires that we not be angry. The requirement of the kingdom of the heavens is fuller and more complete than the demand of the Old Testament law.</p>
<p>In the second half of verse 22 the Lord said, &ldquo;Whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.&rdquo; The word <em>raca</em> means &ldquo;stupid, good-for-nothing.&rdquo; This is an expression of contempt. To say &ldquo;Raca&rdquo; to one&rsquo;s brother is to belittle and despise him. Saying merely raca to one&rsquo;s brother makes one liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin refers to the Jewish council. Because the Lord&rsquo;s audience was Jewish, this word refers to matters that would be understood from their Jewish background. The word <em>moreh</em> means &ldquo;fool.&rdquo; This is a Hebrew expression of condemnation. Therefore, to say &ldquo;Moreh&rdquo; to one&rsquo;s brother is more serious than belittling or despising him. The Lord&rsquo;s word here shows that those who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens cannot get angry, nor can they belittle or despise their brothers. Getting angry and belittling and despising others are related to our temper and our flesh. In other words, the Lord demands that we have no temper and no flesh. We must put our self to death, and we must deal with our temper and our flesh. Then we can meet the demand of the kingdom of the heavens, and our righteousness will surpass that of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>In verses 23 and 24 the Lord said, &ldquo;If you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.&rdquo; This example is based on the Jewish background. Some people think that because the Lord&rsquo;s word in this section refers to items from the Jewish background, this teaching was given to the Jews. This view is inaccurate. The Lord&rsquo;s teaching concerning the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is for all His disciples. The disciples who followed the Lord when He was on the earth were still in Judaism; therefore, the Lord sometimes gave examples from their Jewish background, and He also followed some Jewish regulations. For example, after the Lord cleansed the leper in chapter 8, He said to him, &ldquo;Go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded&rdquo; (v. 4). In 5:23 the offering of a gift at the altar is in this principle. As Christians, we do not have an outward, visible altar, nor do we need to offer up physical gifts. Spiritually speaking, however, we should offer up gifts at the altar.</p>
<p>The offering of a gift refers to fellowship with God. An offering was related to sin, but a gift was related to fellowship with God. Here the Lord was saying that if we remember that a brother has something against us while we are fellowshipping with God, we should deal with the matter first and then continue our fellowship with God. A person in the kingdom of the heavens must not have any barriers between him and others.</p>
<p>Verse 23 speaks of a brother having something against us. It does not say who offended whom. Therefore, we should not think that we need to be reconciled with our brother only if we are in the wrong. Even if we are not in the wrong, we must go and be reconciled to our brother if he has something against us. This is not a matter of offending but of having something against someone and of reconciliation. This is a severe demand that requires us to have no anger, no flesh, and no self. Someone under the Old Testament law might never murder and thus be according to the law&rsquo;s demand of not murdering, but he may be full of anger and the flesh. A person in the kingdom of the heavens should not murder, but even more he should not have anger, the flesh, or the self. The law of the kingdom of the heavens requires that we put our anger, our flesh, and our self to death. The Old Testament law requires man only to not murder, but the New Testament kingdom of the heavens requires us to die, to put to death our anger, our flesh, and our self, which is equal to dying.</p>
<p>In verses 25 and 26 the Lord went on to say, &ldquo;Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans.&rdquo; The phrase <em>your opponent at law</em> indicates that we may be in the wrong. According to verse 23, a brother can have something against us even though we are not in the wrong. In verse 25 we are in the wrong and have an opponent at law. Whether or not we are in the wrong, we must seek to be well disposed toward all. This demand of the law of the kingdom of the heavens requires that we be unreasonable toward ourselves. If we argue that the brother is wrong but that we are not, this reasoning proves that we still have anger, the flesh, and the self.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word shows that those who have problems with other believers cannot have normal fellowship with God. The fellowship between us and the brothers is a prerequisite of our fellowship with God. God does not ask whether we are right or wrong; He asks about our fellowship with the brothers. If we have a problem with a brother, God will say, &ldquo;Do not come to offer a gift to Me, for it is not acceptable to Me. You must first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then you can come to Me.&rdquo; Therefore, the Lord is touching a very serious matter here.</p>
<p>The phrase <em>while you are with him on the way</em> signifies that we are still living in this life. We are not yet before the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10); we are still on this heavenly journey together. Therefore, we must grasp the opportunity to be well disposed toward our brother. If we lose the opportunity, the Lord will judge us in the future, and we will be chastised and suffer loss. The word <em>quadrans</em> in <em>until you pay the last quadrans</em> is not focused on material riches but on the smallest shortcoming that we have toward others. If we do not deal with our shortcomings today, one day the Lord will chastise us until we have dealt with every shortcoming.</p>
<p>The demand of the New Testament kingdom of the heavens concerning anger is much higher than that of the Old Testament law. The Old Testament law requires us only to not murder, but the kingdom of the heavens requires us to not reason and respond in anger. The focus in the kingdom of the heavens is not on whether our outward conduct or actions are right but on whether our heart and spirit have peace and are proper. Under the demand of the kingdom of the heavens, it is not a matter of actions but of our heart and spirit. If we are under the authority of the kingdom and allow the cross to deal with our temper and flesh, our heart will be at peace, and our spirit will be proper. Then, instead of disputing, we will seek to be well disposed toward others. This is the highest expression of those who are ruled by the kingdom of the heavens.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
