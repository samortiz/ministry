One Brethren assembly became divided over whether to use a piano or an organ in their meeting. Some may want to use guitars in the meeting, but others may not agree with this. Who is wrong and who is right? If we argue in this way, our arguments will be endless. We must be delivered from all these arguments. The place where we should be is not in our mentality. The place where we should be is in the spirit.</P><P>Some may not like the church meetings because they think they are too loud. But we need to turn to our spirit and see what the Lord would say. The Lord said in His Word that we need to make a joyful noise and even shout (Psa. 100:1; Isa. 12:6)! A voice is orderly, but a noise is not. Let us make a joyful noise and shout to the Lord! Hebrews 5:7 says concerning Christ, "This One, in the days of His flesh, having offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying...." When we are under extreme pressure or in a very difficult environment, as the Lord was, we will pray with strong crying. If we do not make a joyful noise, shout, and cry out, we cannot be released to the uttermost. This kind of exercise will fill us with joy and rejoicing.</P><P>The main point is that we touch the Lord in our spirit. It is not a matter of how we worship, but a matter of whether or not we are released and touching the Lord in the spirit. We all have to come back to the spirit. When we come back to the spirit, we have the presence of the Lord, and we are one. In the spirit we are one, and in the spirit we offer Christ to God. It is in the spirit that we enjoy Christ with one another before God. We have the corporate worship in today's Jerusalem, our spirit, not with the offerings, but with Christ. In this way God's habitation is built up.</P><P>Today a number of Christians would say that they care for meeting in the Lord's name. But we also need to take care of the Lord's habitation. We must meet in a place where the name of the Lord is and where the habitation of God is. The habitation is the building. Where the name of the Lord is and where the building of the saints is, that is the right place for all of us to come together to worship the Lord. That place is our spirit. If we are in our spirit, we are one and we are being built up. The mind is the divisive field. We are not one with one another in the mind. We all have to stay in our spirit. Here is oneness. Here is unity. Here is peace. Here is the building of the Body. Here is the habitation of God. And here is the worship to God.</P><P>Christ became flesh to get rid of the flesh, and He became the Spirit to strengthen our spirit. This mingled spirit is the place where we should be built together and where we should worship God, not with what we have by ourselves, but with what Christ is to us. In our spirit we enjoy Him. This is the proper way to have the church life. Let us practice all the time to turn back to the spirit. Then we will have the proper church life. The human, regenerated, transformed, and indwelt spirit is our place for the building up of the Body, for the practicing of the church life, for the real worship to God, and for our fellowship with one another. As we remain in our spirit and turn to our spirit, spontaneously we will have a proper Christian life in our daily walk and a proper church life corporately. This is God's way.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
