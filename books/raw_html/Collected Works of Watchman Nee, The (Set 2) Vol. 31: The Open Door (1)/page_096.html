<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>We arrived in Ch'eng-tu yesterday at 3:20 p.m. Even though the seats on the bus had no backs, the Lord's grace was sufficient. He constantly graces people like us. He really is a marvelous Lord! Today Brother Chao Rue-tze said that not long after he came to Ch'eng-tu, he thought of preaching the gospel in a teahouse because the teahouses here can seat one to two hundred people. I mentioned that X was preparing to print a general gospel tract in Chungking. We hope it can come out soon. Brother Wang Yung-gui, who is studying medicine at Chi-Loo University, once passed out gospel tracts at many teahouses. Brother Tseng has also preached the gospel in those places when he was in the countryside. I have also heard that there are Westerners working among the natives in Sung-Pan (not far from Ch'eng-tu, where some tribesmen live), and they have learned to speak their language. Praise and thank the Lord! Although I cannot do anything, the very news of the Lord's work fills me with joy and praise! Mrs. Shen mentioned that there is a group of professors' wives at West China University, who have a meeting every Tuesday. They have invited me to go next Tuesday to give a testimony to them. May we decrease and the Lord increase!</p><p>Peace Wang<br />March 4</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Thank the Lord, He has opened the door for the work. Both the Dong-Gwan Gospel Hall and the China Inland Mission have invited Brother Yu-zhi to preach. Hwa-Ying Girls' Secondary School, Jen Chi Women's Hospital, and the Baptist Women's Missionary School have given me time to go preach the gospel. I had three meetings with the sisters after I came here and studied a little with them about knowing the ways of God. The meetings have manifested God's presence and blessing. Next week I will begin to have a women's gospel meeting in senior Mrs. Duan's (of West China University) daughter's house (her last name is Tsou). Most of the people will be female students from West China University plus some of the professors' wives.</p><p>Peace<br />March 10</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>The gospel meetings in the Tsou home ended on the evening of the eighteenth. The audience was very good, but I do not know how they received it inwardly. Tonight we will begin some meetings in Mrs. Shen's house in order to read something such as Bible Studies for Beginners with the new believers. We will probably finish on the twenty-sixth. The China Inland Mission has asked me to testify next week. I have heard that their Western pastor, X, is a good brother. Brother Yu-zhi went and preached there once. Many of their sisters come here to hear the messages. Sister Liao En-rong, Pi Yung-chin, and Liu Shu-chin are all in Ch'eng-tu. They came last night to the table meeting. Several parochial girls' high schools and the Hsieh-Ho Women's Teachers' School have all given me some time to preach. Today I am going to Hwa-Mei Girls' School (under the Methodist Church). I have been to the Hwa-Ying Girls' School (under the Episcopalian Church) five times. Thank the Lord for opening the door! May what comes out of my mouth not cause His gospel to suffer! I need new grace and strength! I need His overshadowing as well as His restriction! I need Him to constantly save me from myself in the work!</p><p>Peace<br />March 21</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>If I delay going to Kuei-yang, perhaps I should still go to Tsi-Liu-Jing and stay for awhile. I will have to delay going to Ji-Jung and Nei-Jiang. Brother Yu-zhi will preach the gospel at Hsia-Dong-Da Street in Ch'eng-tu every evening at seven o'clock from March 30 to April 2. This week we must also go to the First Prison in Szechuan to preach the gospel to the men and women convicts. The Methodist Church has invited me to testify on April 3. May the Lord give grace.</p><p>Peace<br />March 28</p>
