   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How can we know if what we are doing to please God is from ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First of all we must see that God wants only Christ, not our good works nor our good behavior nor even our spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the veils of our concepts must be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then we must pray unceasingly, breathing Christ in as the air, the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However well we eat, if we do not breathe the proper air into every part of our being, we shall not have good health.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is likened to the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we receive Him into us in all these ways, we are living by Him and He is constituted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we do then pleases God, because it comes from His life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In our daily living some of us have jobs which keep our minds occupied the whole day; others have work which doesn't require concentration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If our minds are free, should we exercise to memorize verses and pray?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By exercise and by practice we must learn to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we think in terms of turning back to the Lord, we are indicating that we do not abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However busy we are in our work, however concentrated we must be, we should still be abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not easy, for we were not born this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we have been reborn as branches of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The vine today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even while we keep using our mentality to do our work, we still can remain in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Don't think that after you do your work you will come back to abide.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There should be no need to return.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Practice abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Begin in the morning by opening the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Memorizing Bible verses is good, but it is better to have that happen in a spontaneous way, while you are praying over them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As you pray-read, some sentences or verses will be impressed upon your mind, and these will be your daily nourishment, helping you to keep abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Coming to the Word throughout the day is like recharging your battery so it doesn't run out of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do this at specific times during the day, besides constantly opening to the Lord in unceasing prayer, whether you are away at work or home tending to household duties.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not easy to explain how to enjoy Christ and how to take Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mankind has been on the earth for thousands of years, yet the matter of diet is still being investigated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some of the substances in our food are still unknown or not understood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I often consider how I can best help the saints in the matter of enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is only since 1958 that we have been using this term.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now, "enjoying Christ" and "practicing the church life" another term we introduced have come into common usage.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe other Christians have also begun using these terms.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How can we know what kind of testimonies are suitable for the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the denominations the terms worship or service are used instead of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have a Sunday morning worship service and an evening service.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is in the recovery that the word meeting is used.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The whole concept of Christian meetings, in denominational thinking, is off.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we want to know what the proper meetings should be, we can consider the Old Testament type.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Israelites gathered together seasonally, seven times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The main gatherings were three times a year: for the Passover, for the feast of weeks, and for the feast of tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Three times a year all the males had to appear before the Lord in the place of His choosing Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That place was Mount Zion, where the city of Jerusalem was built.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How did they gather?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They first labored on the land until the harvest time arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then they came together with the rich produce, not to kneel down, nor prostrate themselves, nor sing a hymn, nor offer a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, they offered the top ten percent of their increase to God and then ate together what they had offered to God in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What then was the nature of their coming together?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They met to feast on the produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their eating together in the presence of God was their worship and their service.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For us today it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We come together at certain times appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before that we must labor on Christ, our good land, so that we have a harvest of experiences of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Daily we experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These experiences become the surplus of His riches, which we bring to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No one is to appear before the Lord empty-handed Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must be full of the rich experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This Christ we then offer to God and enjoy Him together.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The testimonies are part of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We offer these experiences to God as food to satisfy Him and one another as well.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The testimonies must come out of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our living is what determines how rich a meeting we shall have.</S>
