   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORKS WHICH THE LORD ACCOMPLISHED IN HIS PROCESSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to see that our Lord is not the founder of a religion but One who died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From the time of His incarnation to the time of His ascension, He did a number of great works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have already pointed out in the second chapter that the Lord's all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness are manifested in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Due to limitations, I was not detailed enough, so I would like to add a further word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our Lord was incarnated, passed through human living, passed through death, entered into resurrection, and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What commission did His work fulfill?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first step He took was to bring God from heaven into man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before Him, in the four thousand years of human history, no one had ever had God in him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whether sages or sinners, whether good or evil, they were all alike in that they did not have God in them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then one day, in the city of David, a child was born who was laid in a manger, and within this child was God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus' incarnation brought the complete Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit into man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That day, on the earth there was a descendent of Adam, who was Jesus the Nazarene, who had God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The complete God was brought into man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, while Jesus was on the earth in those thirty-three and a half years, He became an exceedingly mysterious person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was a genuine man, yet it was God who lived in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then when He went to the cross, He brought the created man, whom He had become, with all the creation, the devil, and sin to be crucified there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Like a huge broom, the cross gave the whole universe an extensive sweeping and thus ended the entire old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan was terminated, the demons were annihilated, sin was cleared up, and you and I were also ended there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hallelujah, this is the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As I have said before, when the Lord Jesus died, He passed through death, and while He was passing through death, He did a great work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He died in seven statuses as the Lamb of God, the bronze serpent, the last Adam, the Firstborn of all creation, a man in the flesh, the Peacemaker, and the divine grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He passed through death in many statuses, and in the process, He accomplished a particular work in each status.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the Lamb of God, He took away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the bronze serpent, He dealt with our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the last Adam, He terminated our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the Firstborn of all creation, He ended all the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a man in the likeness of the flesh, He condemned sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the Peacemaker, He abolished the law of the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, as the grain of wheat, He released the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If He had not died, the divine life could not have been released.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once He died, the divine life was released from the shell of the grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His death was truly a great step in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He accomplished a great work in His passing through death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the accomplishment of His great work, He also rested.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While He was resting, He went in His living Spirit to the place where the fallen angelic spirits are imprisoned temporarily to proclaim to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, 1 Peter 3:18 says that Christ, on the one hand, was put to death in the flesh, but on the other hand, was made alive in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is just like a grain of wheat that is sown into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the outward shell, it decays and dies, but according to the life within, its organic function is activated and made alive so that it grows.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, when the Lord Jesus passed through death and accomplished His work, He was strengthened, made alive, in His living Spirit, and then He walked out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That was His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In such a resurrection He brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In His incarnation God was brought into man, while in His resurrection man was brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must thank and praise the Lord and shout with joy!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today there is a man sitting on the throne in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Stephen was stoned to death, he saw the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today some theologians do not believe that the Lord Jesus is still a man after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They say that the Lord Jesus was a man only from His birth to His crucifixion, and that after His resurrection from the dead, He ceased to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When He was born, He put on humanity, but once He resurrected, He put off everything of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They say, therefore, that today He is not man but only God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Bible tells us clearly that today in the heavens He still has His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before His incarnation, our Lord was God, not man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From the time He put on flesh and was born on the earth, He was not only God but also man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After His resurrection and ascension, He was still not only God but also man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nevertheless, before His resurrection, His humanity was of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After His resurrection, His humanity of the old creation was uplifted into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This may be likened to a grain of wheat, which is small and brownish in its outward form.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When it is sown into the earth, its shell decays, and the germ within breaks forth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way the grain changes in its outward form and becomes a green sprout.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The sprout grows into a stalk, and after more growth, green leaves come out.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After still more growth, ears of wheat appear.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, after the ears are produced, its form and shape have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First Corinthians 15 shows us that after the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead, He was still a man, yet His body was a resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came to the place where His disciples were and stood in their midst, although the doors were shut.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The disciples thought that they saw a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord showed them the marks of the nails on His hands and the mark on His side to prove that He had a body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How can we explain that the resurrected Christ still has a body?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I do not know how to explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are many great things in this universe that we cannot explain.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our Lord resurrected, and as the Spirit He still has a resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To this day He is still a man on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Praise Him!</S>
