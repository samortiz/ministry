<h2 class="head2">The Co-workers' Meeting in Lan-Si</h2><p>Peace to my brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee:</p><p>I received both the money which you wired to me through the Bank of China on the twenty-fourth and your letter of the twenty-fifth. I passed on X dollars to Brother Chen Meng-jao and distributed the rest. Thank the Lord, and thank you. We still meet and work as usual. The children of God are all at peace. All the brothers and sisters who fled to Lan-Si have moved into the countryside. I am still in the city for the meetings and for attending to practical matters. We had a meeting from January 31 to February 4. Ten people attended (elders and co-workers) to consider the kind of work and way God would have us take. Praise God, He has already given us new light, new work, and a new way. From now on, the assembly and the workers, the work and the church, will be separate but will cooperate. In the past the assemblies rallied around the workers. In other words, the workers became the leaders in the church, and the church and the work were mixed up. Now we know that this is not the pattern left by the early apostles. Therefore, we hope to have a conference with the entire congregation to explain these matters to them more fully. There are eight local churches in this area (Lan-Si), one city, two northern townships, and five southern townships. Although there are responsible brothers in each locality who take care of the practical matters in the house of God, very few of the gifts spoken of in Ephesians 4:11 visit to edify the churches. May the Lord raise up some for His name's sake. Please pray for us. I have lived in Lan-Si for twenty years. Throughout these years I have been working for the Lord on the one hand, and practicing medicine on the other hand. However, in the past two or three years, I have gone out to work more and more, and my medical practice has dwindled. I have a feeling in my heart to serve God full-time. I have prayed about this for almost two years. Recently, the environment seems to indicate that God is moving in this direction. I have been more desperate during the past two months as I waited. Do you have any opinion that you can give me? (I know you are busy.) I am asking because I want to walk according to God's will. I hope to speak to you about the rest face to face. May the Lord give you more of His word and commission that you may help and serve us and, by doing so, help and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. May power, honor, and glory be to the Father.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Ma Chuan-foo<br />February 8<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Women's Work<br />in the Refugee Camps in Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>I go to the refugee camps every morning and return at noon. Every week I speak three times in the first camp to about two hundred people. I am also responsible for the preaching every day in the second camp. Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Lu also go along to help. Sometimes there are more than four hundred people listening, sometimes a little less. Although we have come short in the Lord's work because of our foolishness and unfaithfulness, the Lord still works beyond what we can do. He manifests His glory through the sisters' prayer behind us. One sister bears the responsibility of prayer in the background. Thank the Lord for raising up a supplicating one. He really heard her prayers. Although she never leaves her house, her work is more precious than that of many who run around. Praise the Lord!</p><p>Tso Fu-ru<br />January 27</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>The work at Jiao-Tung University refugee camp has been completed. Sister Tso has been gone for about two weeks, along with Mrs. Lee Han-shen and Mrs. Lu Tze-ming. We cannot say that God did not bless the work, but we fear that we were not faithful enough. Thank God, we saw His hand in the beginning and end of this work. May we fully trust in Jehovah day by day, and may we rely on His grace rather than on our own wisdom. We thank and praise God all the more for His glory, His faithfulness, and His acts!</p><p>Liu Hwei-fen<br />January 31</p><p>(The preceding two letters were sent from Shanghai to Chungking&mdash;Editor.)</p>
