   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Thorny Ground</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third category is the thorny ground v. 7 . The thorns choke the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus told us that the thorns signify three things: the anxieties of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things v. 19 . People today are caught up with this age.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are never satisfied with what they have.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they have an older car, they want a newer one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If they live in a house, they want a better house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are the cares of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To a seeker of Christ, a seeking one in the church life, it makes no difference what kind of car or dwelling he has.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the cares of the age choke the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many of the young Chinese who come to this country are so ambitious to get a doctor's degree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The young people surely have to study, but they should not study so ambitiously to the extent that they make education their goal and not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even with those of us who have a job, we should try to work eight hours a day and five days a week, leaving the rest of our time for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should do a good job, but we should not care for overtime or for promotions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We would never be cheated by the deceitfulness of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you sell yourself to your job to get a promotion, your job becomes Pharaoh to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, makes the people of God very busy so that they do not have time for God's interests.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A brother may get a doctor's degree or receive a good promotion, but this may cause him to be too busy to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He may have to work day and night to sell himself for his job, for his promotion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then how can he grow in life?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the deceitfulness of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do we really need that much money?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to simplify our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not be a slave to make money or a slave to spend money.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have to spend much of your energy to make money and then more time to spend the money.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you make less money, you will save your time in spending money.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The ones who spend much time to make money are enslaved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They spend more energy in spending money, and then they spend more time in using the things they buy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They have time for everything but no time for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the deceitfulness of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to be simple in making money, in using money, and in using things that are bought by money.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not make that much money, we do not need to spend that much money, and we do not need more time to use the things we buy with the money.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So we are so simple in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are so free, liberated, and simplified for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have plenty of time for the Lord and for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should just spend enough time on our job to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the rest of our hours should be for the Lord and for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this way, it is so easy for the life within us to grow because nothing is choking it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also have to beware of the lusts, or the desires, for other things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Maybe your goal and desire are to have a doctor's degree.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That could be a lust which can choke the life within you.</S>
