   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The work they did was the work of overseeing.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since heresies and evil teachings were prevalent at that time, being "apt to teach" must have been one of their qualifications 1 Tim 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we must not make the mistake in thinking that since elders should be apt to teach, all therefore who teach are the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must not think that since the elders are ordained, or appointed, that therefore everyone who teaches should be ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we have this thought, we are most definitely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, an elder does not teach because he has become an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, he is one who is apt to teach first, then afterwards is ordained an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As such, is it not clear that before his ordination, he was teaching others already?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, in the books to Timothy, the apostle clearly separated the elders from those who teach: "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching" 1 Tim 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, an elder is one who manages a church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He can manage a church well without being a teaching one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From the above we can see that the Bible does not warrant such things as a church ordaining someone to do the work of preaching and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This latter practice is but a different form of the Roman Catholic priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Such a human invention and tradition is not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, some zealous religionists think that believers should honor all the systems of the church and that although the Scripture contains no such teaching, we should abide by such decisions of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What kind of doctrine is this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Does this not carry the tone of Roman Catholicism with it?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The overriding principle in Roman Catholicism is that authority rests with the church and that even the Bible has to be interpreted according to the mandate of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It does not allow believers to read the Bible and requires that man obey the church more than he obeys the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As Protestants, are we not opposed to this principle?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Does not the principle of Protestantism state that apart from the Bible the church has no authority?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is not our principle that of complete obedience to the Bible and not to the church?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we recognize the existence of the authority of the church, are we not going back to Roman Catholicism?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Son of God told us Himself that we need not keep man's tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said of those who were keen to abide by the tradition of their ancestors that "this people honors Me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from Me; but in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men" Matt 15:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we want to abide by man's tradition, we are transgressing the commandment of God v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since we cannot find in the Bible the teaching of ordination for the evangelists and the shepherds and teachers, we know that the system of the denominations is a tradition of man and is of no effect to those Christians who faithfully love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, many have often argued that elders and deacons were still ordained in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This being the case, can we not ordain pastors according to the principle that the elders were ordained in the old days?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Concerning this matter, allow me to speak a frank word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do those who speak these words know what kind of qualifications there are for an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here is a person who is not yet married and who is still young in age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has recently received a diploma from a Bible school and has worked for only a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now he is ordained as a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One says that this is according to the biblical principle of the ordination of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Does this not surprise one who knows the Bible well?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Can such a person be an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have said that elders are for managing a church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Shepherding, however, is a gift Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have also mentioned that the exercise of a gift does not require man's acknowledgement and ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the above reason cannot be considered as a proper reason.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Bible scholars have long ago pointed out that in the Bible no individual church has only one elder.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every time the Bible mentions the elders of individual churches or what we call now the congregation, it is always plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we consider the present pastors as the elders, in addition to confusing officers with gifts, we are changing the number of elders in a church from plural to singular!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The churches in the Bible had many elders, yet the present churches have only one pastor for a church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we recognize the ordination invented by the Nicolaitans, we will have to do what practically cannot be done.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Bible scholars have already told us that the elders and deacons in the Bible were ordained, or more correctly put, commissioned, by either the apostles themselves or those charged by the apostles or who came in the authority of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are to ordain the elders and the deacons today, we must first ask, where are the present-day apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where are those who have a direct charge from the apostles or who have received the authority of the apostles, like Titus and Timothy did?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, those who want to ordain others must first prove their own qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you are not an apostle and you do not have the charge or the authority from the apostles, you have no right to ordain others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who are ordained should ask if the one who ordains them is an apostle or not.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If he is not, such ordination is a vain ordination!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All those who believe in the Bible recognize the fact that there are no longer any apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As such, does it not mean that there is now no more ordination?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We admit that in the present churches not the denominations there are those who are doing the work which the elders and deacons in the ancient time used to do, but we do not recognize anyone as being officially ordained as an elder or a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have mentioned this matter before.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here we do not need to repeat it again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, we have to know that the teaching of the Nicolaitans does not involve only a group of people uplifting themselves to a special position.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to realize that this is something that the common believers prefer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the ordinary believers object to this and consider this a loss of their right and a demotion of their qualification, such unscriptural and damaging hierarchical distinction between the clergy and the laity would not have prevailed as it has.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is because the ordinary believers love this that the teaching of the Nicolaitans was allowed to prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The laity is grateful to the clergy because these professional ones are willing to replace the nonprofessional ones to bear the responsibility of all spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since believers have lost their first love, they have long ago lost their taste for spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As such they are more than willing for someone to come and take over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By calling themselves the laity, they consider themselves just the ordinary believers, which means that they cannot be blamed for being worldly!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The world should not expect them to be too spiritual!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's foreordained words were not only fulfilled in the Israelites but are also realized in the church today: "The prophets prophesy falsely, / And the priests rule by their own authority; / And My people love it this way" Jer 5:31 .</S>
