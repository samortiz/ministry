What we will consider here will be helpful not only to those who teach in our summer school but to all those who speak for the Lord.<p>We need to have the proper understanding of the words teacher, teaching, and school. Regarding these words we all may have our own &#8220;lexicons.&#8221; Let us drop the different lexicons and come to the Scriptures as the unique lexicon. The word teaching is found in 2 Timothy 3:16, where we are told that &#8220;all Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching.&#8221; The only time the word school is used in the New Testament is in Acts 19:9. This verse tells us that when &#8220;some were hardened and would not be persuaded, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude,&#8221; Paul &#8220;withdrew from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.&#8221; Tyrannus might have been a teacher, and Paul might have rented his school and used it as a meeting hall to preach and teach the word of the Lord to both Jews and Gentiles for two years (v. 10). Paul alluded to some kind of school when he told us that he was &#8220;trained at the feet of Gamaliel&#8221; (22:3), a teacher of the law (5:34).<h2 class=head1>THE SCRIPTURES TEACHING US GOD HIMSELF</h2><p>The reason we need to set aside our personal lexicons and study the words of the Scriptures is that the Scriptures teach us the things of God and the things concerning God. We may even say that the Scriptures teach us God Himself. When some hear this they may ask, &#8220;Can we teach God? How can God be taught?&#8221; Today&#8217;s seminaries do not teach God; they merely teach about God. The Scriptures, on the contrary, teach us God and also teach us the things of God. There is a great difference between teaching about God and teaching God.<h2 class=head1>THE SCRIPTURES BEING GOD-BREATHED</h2><p>However, many Christians do not realize the significance of this difference. When they read the Bible, they read it in the same way as they read a secular book. This is absolutely wrong. The Bible, especially the New Testament, does not teach us to read the Scriptures in a common, secular way. Rather, Ephesians 6:17 and 18 tell us to receive the word of God by means of all prayer and petition. The reason we need to receive the word of God by prayer is that, according to 2 Timothy 3:16, the Scriptures are God-breathed. This indicates that the Scriptures are the breathing out of God. God has breathed Himself out in the Scriptures, and thus our reading of the Scriptures should be our receiving of God&#8217;s breath. When God breathes Himself out, He exhales Himself. When we read the Scriptures, or when we receive the Scriptures, we inhale God. Reading the Bible therefore involves both God&#8217;s exhaling and our inhaling. This is altogether different from reading a book in a secular way. Unfortunately, many believers read the Bible in the same way as they read a textbook or a newspaper. This is a serious mistake, and we must avoid it as we are taking care of the young people in the Summer School of Truth.<p>We should not conduct the Summer School of Truth in a secular way. Actually, I do not like the word school. Using this word may cause others to think that we intend to teach in a common, secular manner. Some may even have the concept that the ones who take care of the Summer School of Truth should be school teachers by profession. This concept is mistaken. Being a school teacher does not qualify one for serving in our summer school. Do not think that having been a school teacher for many years qualifies someone to teach in our summer school. Those who serve in the Summer School of Truth should not serve according to their natural ability or professional training. Our summer school does not deal with any secular matters, such as mathematics, history, geography, and science. Instead, our summer school is for the handling of the divine truth, that is, the reality of the Triune God. What we intend to teach our young people is the reality of the Triune God. Concerning this, our natural teaching ability does not avail.<h2 class=head1>THE NATURE OF THE SUMMER SCHOOL OF TRUTH</h2><p>My burden in this message is to point out what the nature of the Summer School of Truth is. Once we have a clear understanding of the nature of our summer school, we will know what to do and how to do it.<h2 class=head2>Not Teaching Theology but Ministering the Triune God as Spiritual Food</h2><p>The nature of the Summer School of Truth actually is not a matter of teaching but of ministering or serving. The purpose of our summer school is to minister something to the young people. We may use a restaurant as an illustration. A restaurant is not for teaching about food but for serving food. Those who serve in a restaurant do not merely give people a menu and then teach them about food. Instead, the serving ones supply others with different courses of food for eating. The principle should be the same with what we call the Summer School of Truth. In a sense, our summer school is a kind of school, but actually it should be a &#8220;restaurant.&#8221; Our intention is not to give the young people a &#8220;menu&#8221; and then teach them about God. Our intention is to serve, to minister, God as different &#8220;dishes&#8221; for eating. Thus, the nature of the Summer School of Truth is a matter of ministering, of serving, the Triune God to the young people.<p>The situation of today&#8217;s seminaries is very different from this. Seminary instructors pay very little attention, if any, to ministering spiritual food to the students. Instead of ministering God, these instructors mainly teach theology, the mere knowledge about God. They do not minister God Himself to the students. We do not want our summer school to resemble a theological school or seminary. Our school should actually be a &#8220;restaurant&#8221; serving the Triune God to the young saints.<h2 class=head2>Bringing the Young People to the Triune God through the Lesson Books, Which Are Based on the Bible</h2><p>In the Summer School of Truth our textbook is the Bible, and all our lesson books are based on the Bible. Our goal is to bring the young people not to the lesson books but to bring them to the Triune God through the lesson books. Our lesson books should be a channel through which the young people are brought to the Triune God. If you realize this, then you will also realize that it is not sufficient merely to teach your class with the lesson book as if you were teaching in a secular school. Everyone in your class should gain the Triune God. Do not bring the young people to the lesson book-bring them to the Triune God through the lesson book. The lesson book is a channel for those whom you are serving to be brought to God and to gain God. This means that your aim is not to teach the lesson book but to bring the young people to God through the channel of the lesson book. This is the nature of the Summer School of Truth.<p>Through your teaching, your serving, in the Summer School of Truth, everyone in your class should be brought to God. You need to pray and endeavor concerning this. You need to labor to bring every young person in your class to the Triune God, so that by the time you have finished all the lessons, the students in your class will have gained the Triune God and will have been filled with God, not with mere knowledge about God in letters.<h2 class=head1>THE UNIQUENESS OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>We have seen that our textbook is the Bible. Now we need to consider further what the Bible is. Apparently the Bible is the same as any other book-a composition of words. Whereas all secular books are the same in nature, the Bible is different from other books. The Bible is unique.<h2 class=head2>The Holy Breath</h2><p>I would like to point out again that 2 Timothy 3:16 says, &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed.&#8221; The Scriptures are the breath of God, or the breathing out of God, God&#8217;s breathing out of Himself. The Bible, therefore, is God&#8217;s breath, and God&#8217;s breath is the Spirit of God, for God is Spirit (John 4:24). The Greek word for Spirit is pneuma, which is also the word for breath. Thus, we may say that the Holy Spirit is the holy breath (cf. John 20:22). God is Spirit, and the Spirit is the holy breath. To say that all Scripture is God-breathed is to say that the Bible is the breath, the breathing out, of the very God who is Spirit. God has breathed Himself out, and this breathing out of God is the Bible. This is what 2 Timothy 3:16 is saying when it tells us that the Scriptures are God-breathed.<h2 class=head2>Spirit and Life</h2><p>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&#8221; The word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus is spirit, pneuma. His words are the embodiment of the Spirit, who gives life. This indicates that the word which comes out of the Lord&#8217;s mouth is His breath, the breathing out of Himself. This is a further indication that the words of the Scriptures are God-breathed.<h2 class=head2>The Sword of the Spirit</h2><p>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul charges us to receive &#8220;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&#8221; The antecedent of which is Spirit, not sword, indicating that the Spirit is the word of God. When we read the Bible, we must touch the word of God as the Spirit. Along with 2 Timothy 3:16 and John 6:63, this verse reveals that the Bible is God&#8217;s breathing out. Since God is Spirit, what He breathes out must also be Spirit. The words of the Bible, therefore, are the breathing out of God Himself as the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>PROFITABLE FOR TEACHING, CONVICTION, CORRECTION, AND INSTRUCTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>Second Timothy 3:16 says not only that the Scriptures are God-breathed but also that the Scriptures are &#8220;profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&#8221; On God&#8217;s side the Bible is God&#8217;s breathing. On our side the Bible is for us to receive profit in four matters-teaching, conviction or reproof, correction, and instruction. The order here is significant. Why does teaching and not instruction come first? Why does correction come before instruction and reproof before correction? And why does teaching come first? The order is first teaching and then reproof, correction, and instruction.<h2 class=head2>Teaching-the Rolling Away of the Veil</h2><p>What is teaching? How do you understand the word teaching? We need to know the denotation of this word as it is used by Paul.<p>If we have the proper and adequate spiritual experience, we will realize that in verse 16 teaching equals revelation. Teaching is actually nothing less than a divine revelation. Since teaching equals revelation, as you are teaching the young people in your class in the Summer School of Truth, you must present a revelation to them.<p>A revelation is the opening of a veil. As you are teaching the young people, you should be taking away a veil so that they may see something of the Triune God. A certain matter may be hidden from view, but by your teaching you should gradually open the veil. This is teaching.<p>When you are serving in the Summer School of Truth, you should not allow the veil to remain over the eyes of the young people. Rather, as they are listening to you, the veil should be rolled away little by little. To teach is to roll away the veil. Go to the summer school for the purpose of rolling away the veil.<p>Now we can see that for the Bible to be profitable for teaching means that it is profitable for unveiling, for rolling away the veil. A veil cannot be taken away suddenly; it cannot be rolled away all at once. On the contrary, the veil is rolled away a little at a time. Time after time and in session after session, you need gradually to roll away the veil. If you do this, your way of teaching will be an unveiling. This kind of teaching always presents a revelation to others. Those who are under such teaching will be able to see something concerning the Triune God.<p>This understanding of teaching applies not only to those who teach in the Summer School of Truth but to all those who speak for the Lord. When you speak something in the church meeting, your speaking should be the rolling away of the veil. This means that your speaking should present a revelation.<h2 class=head2>Reproof Coming from the Revelation We Receive</h2><p>It is significant that in verse 16 teaching is followed by conviction, or reproof. The reason for this is that no one can see something of God without being reproved by what he sees. Those who are under your teaching will see something, and what they see will convict, reprove, them.<p>Whenever we see something of God, we realize our mistakes, wrongdoings, shortcomings, and our sins. The result is that we are reproved; we are rebuked. This reproof comes from the revelation we receive. However, often in our reading of the Scriptures, we read without receiving any revelation, and thus there is no reproof. But when in our reading of the Scriptures we receive a revelation, the revelation will reprove us and rebuke us.<h2 class=head2>Correction</h2><p>Reproof is followed by correction. Teaching, or revelation, brings us reproof, and reproof produces correction. Correction is a matter of setting right what is wrong, turning someone to the right way, and restoring to an upright state.<h2 class=head2>Instruction in Righteousness</h2><p>After we have been corrected, we will receive the proper instruction-the instruction in righteousness. Whereas Paul here does not use any modifiers for teaching, reproof, and correction, he does use a modifier for instruction and speaks of the instruction in righteousness. Righteousness is a matter of being right. Hence, the instruction here is for us to be right.<p>The reason we are reproved and rebuked is that we are wrong in many different ways and aspects. We may be wrong with God, with Christ, and with the Spirit. We may be wrong with the church, with the brothers and sisters, with our husband or wife, with our parents, with our children, with our neighbors, and even with ourselves. We may be wrong in the way we spend our money, in the way we spend our time, in the way we dress, or in the way we style our hair. Because we may be wrong in so many different things, we are rebuked by the revelation we receive when we read the Scriptures.<p>From our experience we know that often we are rebuked immediately after receiving a revelation. I can testify that time after time I have been rebuked by a revelation that came from reading the Bible or from a teaching. Have you not had such an experience? Because we are sinful and unrighteous, we need the rebuking that comes through teaching.<p>We may memorize Bible verses and recite them without experiencing any rebuking. But when we receive a revelation from the Word, that revelation exposes our sinfulness and rebukes us. We are not rebuked by man nor are we rebuked directly by God-we are rebuked by the teaching of the Word. When we are rebuked in this way, we are spontaneously corrected, and when we are corrected we have the instruction in righteousness. The result is that we are adjusted.<p>We may be adjusted in a particular matter and become right in this matter. However, we may not be right in this matter once for all. For example, suppose a brother is wrong with his wife. Under the revelation from the Word, he is rebuked and adjusted. He repents and then apologizes to his wife, and as a result he is now right with her. But a few days later he may be wrong with her again, and once again he will need to be rebuked, corrected, and adjusted.<h2 class=head1>THE MAN OF GOD BECOMING COMPLETE</h2><p>In verse 17 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;That the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.&#8221; A man of God is a God-man, one who partakes of God&#8217;s life and nature (John 1:13; 2 Pet. 1:4), thus being one with God in His life and nature (1 Cor. 6:17) and thereby expressing Him. Such a God-man, such a man of God, is produced by God&#8217;s breathing out of Himself. God&#8217;s breathing produces God-men.<h2 class=head2>Not a Good Man but a God-man</h2><p>You may be a good man but not a God-man. This means that with you there is an extra o. You should have only one o, but instead of one you have two. The more you receive teaching, revelation, the more this extra o will be cut off. However, it is hard to get rid of the second o once for all, for it is like a man&#8217;s beard that appears again after it has been shaved or like the grass that grows again after the lawn has been mowed. From experience we know that the second o always comes back. Perhaps with you this extra o has only partially been cut off, and the part that has been shaved keeps coming back again. If this is our situation, then we are a man of God-a God-man-with an extra o. We need the teaching from the Scriptures to shave away this o again and again.<h2 class=head2>The Issue of Teaching, Reproof, Correction, and Instruction in Righteousness</h2><p>The word that at the beginning of 2 Timothy 3:17 indicates that this verse is an issue of the preceding verse. The issue of teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness is that the man of God becomes complete.<p>In the Summer School of Truth you should present a teaching that is an unveiling, the rolling away of the veil. Then the young people in your class will see something of God, and what they see will rebuke them, correct them, and afford them the proper instruction in righteousness to make them right both with God and with man. The issue, the outcome, will be that the man of God becomes complete and equipped for every good work.<p>The purpose of the Summer School of Truth is not to give mental knowledge to the young people. The goal of our summer school is to present teaching after teaching, revelation after revelation, so that the young ones may see God, see themselves, and be reproved, corrected, and instructed to be right with God and man that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work. Such a person will be a true man of God, a real God-man, continually inhaling the Triune God and thereby receiving revelation, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>RECEIVING THE WORD AS THE LIVING SPIRIT AND COMING TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:16-17; John 6:63; Matt. 4:4; Eph. 6:17-18; 1 Tim. 2:4</h1><p>We have seen that in nature the Scripture, the holy Word, is God&#8217;s breath. The function of the Scripture is to unveil, to roll away the veil. Proper teaching is always a kind of unveiling. After the unveiling, we have reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness &#8220;that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work&#8221; (2 Tim. 3:17).<h2 class=head1>THE LORD&#8217;S WORDS BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2><p>Let us now go on to consider further another important verse related to the nature of the Bible-John 6:63. Here the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&#8221; This indicates that the Lord&#8217;s words are the embodiment of the Spirit of life. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we get the Spirit, who gives life.<p>When we read the Bible, we should receive life; and when we teach others concerning the Bible, they should receive life. If we do not receive life when we read the Bible, something is wrong. In our reading of the Bible, there may be no spirit; and in our teaching of the Bible to others, there also may be no spirit. For there to be no spirit means that there is no life. We may read a portion of the Bible, several verses or a few chapters, without receiving the life supply. The reason for this lack of supply is that in our reading of the Word there is no spirit. If we do not sense the Spirit as we are reading the Bible, we should realize that something is wrong, and then we should adjust ourselves.<p>In the same principle, as we are teaching the young people in the Summer School of Truth, we need to check whether there is any spirit in our teaching. If there is no spirit, we should change our way of teaching. Teaching a class in the Summer School of Truth should not be the same as teaching a class in a secular school. In a secular school there is no need of spirit, but in our summer school there is the need of much spirit.<h2 class=head1>INHALING AND EXHALING GOD</h2><p>From experience we know that in order for there to be much spirit in our reading and teaching of the Bible, we need much prayer. We must be a person of prayer. In other words, we must be a person who is continually breathing the Lord, a person who is always inhaling God. Our reading of the Bible should be a kind of inhaling, and our teaching of the Bible should be a kind of exhaling. As you are teaching a class in the Summer School of Truth, you should be exhaling God into your students.<p>The Bible is God&#8217;s breath; this breath is the Spirit; and the Spirit gives life. When you breathe the Spirit you receive not only unveiling, rebuking, correcting, and instructing-you receive life. Whenever you touch the Spirit as you are reading the Bible, you receive life. Likewise, as you are teaching in the Summer School of Truth, you need to touch the Spirit. You should have the sense that you are touching not only the Spirit but also the spirits of your students. You should have the sense that you are exhaling God and that they are inhaling God. This means that there is a communication between your exhaling and their inhaling. This indicates that your way of teaching is right, for you are exercising to minister life to the young people.<p>In teaching the Bible to others, you must be very strict with yourself, adjusting yourself again and again. During one class session you may need to adjust yourself a number of times. If you experience failure the first few times you teach, you should go back to the Lord with much prayer. Pray yourself into the Lord, breathing God into you. Then, having become a praying person, a person who inhales God, go back to your class and exhale what you have received of God.<h2 class=head1>NOURISHING OTHERS WITH THE WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT THROUGH THE MOUTH OF GOD</h2><p>In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&#8221; Here we see that the word that proceeds out of the mouth of God is our real food. This indicates that the Bible is not only for life-imparting but also for nourishing. When you teach the Bible to others, you should nourish them. I hope that all the young ones in your class will have the sense that they are not only being taught but also being nourished. Whether or not they are nourished through your teaching depends on you.<p>The instructors in today&#8217;s seminaries may claim that they are teaching the Bible to their students. Yet most seminary students are being starved to death. They receive no nourishment, because their instructors teach the Bible in a wrong way. They teach the Bible in the same way as instructors in secular schools teach subjects such as geography, history, science, and mathematics. Thus, there is no nourishment. Our way of teaching must be different. When we teach the Scriptures to the young people in the Summer School of Truth, we must nourish the students with the life-supply, with words that proceed out of God&#8217;s mouth.<p>We all need to be living persons, those who are living channels with the words of God proceeding out through us. God&#8217;s word proceeds out through God&#8217;s mouth, and we should let it proceed also out through us as a channel. When in the meetings a certain brother reads the Bible or teaches from the Bible, we do not receive any nourishment, but when another brother does the same thing, we are nourished. The reason for the difference is that the first brother read or spoke without any spirit, but the second brother read or spoke with much spirit. The principle is the same in your teaching a class in the Summer School of Truth. Your teaching must be in spirit and must be with spirit. As you are teaching, you need to be a living channel out through which the word of God is proceeding. If you are such a living channel, then the students in your class will receive spiritual food for their nourishment.<h2 class=head1>THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT KILLING THE ENEMY</h2><p>Let us now turn to Ephesians 6:17. Here Paul charges us to receive &#8220;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&#8221; When I was a young Christian, I did not understand how the word of God could be a sword. I understood what it means to be enlightened by the Bible, for by reading the Bible I was enlightened. To some extent, by the Bible I was also rebuked, corrected, and instructed to be right with God and man. But I did not know how the Bible could become a sword, an offensive weapon to deal with the enemy. To understand this requires spiritual experience.<p>It is common for Christians to be enlightened, rebuked, corrected, and instructed by the Bible, but not many experience the word of the Bible as a sword that kills the enemy. The reason for this lack of experience is that we may receive the word of the Bible for teaching, rebuke, correction, and instruction without touching the Spirit. Even unbelievers may be enlightened by what they read in the Scriptures. Also, they may be rebuked, corrected, and instructed by what the Bible says concerning honor, love, humility, and honesty. However, in their reading of the Scriptures there is nothing of the Spirit. However, if we would take the word of the Bible as a sword for fighting the enemy, we must touch the Bible in a way that is full of the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Word of God Being the Sword Indirectly</h2><p>According to Paul&#8217;s word in Ephesians 6:17, the word of God is the sword not directly but indirectly. Paul speaks of &#8220;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&#8221; Here we have indirectness. The sword is not the word directly. Rather, the sword is the Spirit directly, and then the Spirit is the word. This indicates that if we would deal with the enemy Satan, the Bible must become the Spirit. Without the Spirit it may be possible for us to teach from the Bible that the young people should honor their parents and ask for forgiveness for what they have done wrong. But if we would use the word of the Bible as a sword to kill the enemy, in our experience the word must be the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>Understanding Ephesians 6:17 Experientially</h2><p>At this juncture I would ask you to consider how, in a practical way, the word of the Bible can become the sword of the Spirit for fighting against the enemy. Can you give an illustration of this or a testimony concerning it? Ephesians 6:12 reveals that our enemies are the evil spirits, &#8220;the world-rulers of this darkness,&#8221; &#8220;the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.&#8221; Can you testify from your experience how you have slain these enemies by taking the word as the sword? In order to give such a testimony, we need to understand Ephesians 6:17 experientially by handling the Bible in the way of the Spirit and not merely in a mental way. I am concerned that in the Summer School of Truth you will teach the young people merely in a mental way, as if you were teaching in a secular school. We all have to learn to teach the Bible in the way of the Spirit.<p>Ephesians, a book on the church as the Body of Christ, talks about the Body life, the oneness of the Body (4:4), and the Body being the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:23). We need to realize that things such as our opinion, thought, temper, emotion, natural life, and point of view are often used by the powers of darkness in the air to damage the Body life. As brothers and sisters in the church, we all have our emotion, thought, opinion, and natural life, and we all have our own point of view. Quite often we are offended, not due to the wrongdoings of others but simply due to our emotion or opinion. A chair cannot be offended, because it does not have feelings. No matter how you treat a chair, it will not be offended. However, it is easy for brothers and sisters in the church to be offended.<p>Due to their emotion, sisters are easily offended. Suppose an older brother speaks a word to a particular sister and she is offended because of her emotion. Then the evil power in the air comes in to take advantage of her emotion, and she determines not to forget that she has been offended. Apparently the problem is her emotion. Actually the problem is that her emotion has been taken over by the evil force in the air. This means that the real enemy is not this sister&#8217;s emotion but the evil spirit in the air that takes advantage of her emotion in order to damage the church life. Because of the enemy&#8217;s use of her emotion, this sister first has a negative effect on her husband, and then she goes on to have a negative effect on several others. As a result, part of the Body is poisoned. If the enemy is to be defeated in this situation, the sister must learn to receive the word as the Spirit, which becomes the sword to deal with the enemy.<h2 class=head2>Being Preserved in the Church Life and in the Ministry by Receiving the Word as the Spirit</h2><p>This is something I have learned through many years of experience. I am not a &#8220;marble&#8221; person who cannot be offended. I have often been offended by others in the church life or in my family life. How have I been able to get through all the offenses? I get through by receiving the word as the Spirit. The word I receive as the Spirit then becomes the sword to slay the enemy. Apparently the sword of the Spirit kills my emotion; actually it kills the evil spirit in the air who takes advantage of my emotion. Whereas my emotion is killed directly, the evil spirit is killed indirectly. In this way I have been able to get through the offenses.<p>When some hear this they might say, &#8220;Brother Lee, show me a verse that can kill your emotion directly and kill the evil power in the air indirectly.&#8221; This is not a matter of a particular verse that touches our emotion but a matter of applying Ephesians 6:17 in an experiential way. Suppose in the evening I am offended by one of the elders. Because I fear the Lord, I do not dare to talk about this with others. The next morning I rise up to contact the Lord in the Word. I do not read any verses that touch the matter of my emotion. Instead, I simply begin to read the Bible with the exercise of the spirit. I may read Genesis 1:1: &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&#8221; As I read this verse, I receive the word in a living way as the Spirit, and the Spirit, which is the word, becomes the sword that kills my emotion directly and kills the evil force indirectly. Spontaneously, the offense is gone, and no damage is done to the church. However, if the offense were allowed to remain, it would cause serious damage to the church life. I believe that many of us have experienced receiving the word of God in this way.<p>Without the word as the Spirit to be the killing sword, there would be no way for us to be kept in the church life over the years. For more than half a century, I have been traveling, visiting the churches, and contacting thousands of saints. Without the word as the Spirit to kill all the enemies, I would not still be here ministering. If I had allowed myself to remain offended with a certain church or saint, I would have been finished with the ministry. I have been kept in the church life and in the ministry through the killing of the word as the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>A Spiritual Antibiotic</h2><p>Suppose a particular brother is not happy with the church in his locality. He moves to another city, supposing that he will like the church there. However, after a short period of time, he becomes unhappy with this local church, so he moves to another place. But soon he is offended by something or someone in this church and he moves to yet another locality. Such a person cannot participate in the building up of the church. On the contrary, because there is no killing of the enemy within him, he causes the church to suffer damage.<p>According to Paul&#8217;s word toward the end of Ephesians, a book concerning the church, we need to receive the word of God in a living way, that is, receive the word as the Spirit. The Spirit will then become the killing sword. This sword first kills us directly and then kills the power of darkness in the air indirectly. We may compare this kind of killing to the effect of an antibiotic on the germs that cause illness in our body. In order for our body to be saved, the germs need to be killed by an antibiotic. The word that we receive in a living way as the Spirit is a spiritual antibiotic that kills the &#8220;germs&#8221; within us. When the germs are killed, the evil forces in the air have no way to take advantage of us. Then we can live a healthy Body life, a healthy church life.<p>This is the way I have been preserved in the church life and in my ministry for so many years. Apart from the killing through the word as the Spirit, my ministry would have been terminated. Once again I would emphasize that we need to receive the word of God in a living way, so that in our experience the Spirit becomes the killing sword. When the word becomes the Spirit, the Spirit becomes the sword-the sword of the Spirit that kills the germs in us and the evil spirits in the air. In this way the Body, the church life, and our ministry are saved. This will enable our ministry to have a long life. However, the ministry of certain brothers has not lasted long. In their situation it was their ministry and not the enemy that was killed.<p>Let us all receive the word of God in a living way! As long as in our experience the word becomes the Spirit, the word will not only heal us but also kill the enemy.<p>All those who teach in the Summer School of Truth should help the young ones not merely to receive the word for the learning of certain biblical truths but to receive the word as the living Spirit. When they receive the word as the living Spirit, in their experience the Spirit will become the sword. Receiving the word in this way requires much prayer. This is why we need to have the proper pray-reading. Through pray-reading the Bible, we receive the word in a living way as the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 2:4 Paul tells us that God &#8220;desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.&#8221; Today it seems that most Christians bring others only into God&#8217;s salvation; they do not go further to bring them into the full knowledge of the truth. The purpose of the Summer School of Truth is to bring our young people not only into God&#8217;s salvation but also into the full knowledge of the truth. In this verse truth does not mean doctrine; it means reality and denotes all the real things revealed in God&#8217;s Word, which are mainly Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the Body of Christ. Every saved person should have a full knowledge, a complete realization, of these things. In our summer school, we should endeavor to bring the young people into the experiential knowledge of the reality of the Triune God. In order to do this, we ourselves need to be persons who are in this reality.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>LEARNING TO TEACH GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY IN AN EXPERIENTIAL WAY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 2 Tim. 1:6-7; 2:2, 22</h1><p>In the books of 1 and 2 Timothy we can see the way we should teach others. Regarding teaching, Paul charged Timothy, saying, &#8220;The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also&#8221; (2 Tim. 2:2). Let us consider what these two books tell us about teaching in an experiential way.<h2 class=head1>NOT TEACHING DIFFERENTLY FROM GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul spoke to Timothy, one of his closest co-workers, saying, &#8220;Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God&#8217;s economy, which is in faith.&#8221; This indicates that some were teaching differently from God&#8217;s economy, God&#8217;s dispensation.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Household Administration</h2><p>The Greek word for economy means &#8220;household law&#8221; and implies distribution. This word denotes a household management, a household administration, a household government, and, derivatively, a dispensation, a plan, or an economy for administration (distribution); hence, it is also a household economy. God&#8217;s economy in faith is His household economy, His household administration, which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church (3:15), the Body of Christ. Paul&#8217;s ministry was centered on this economy of God (Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 9:17), whereas the different teachings of the dissenting ones were used by God&#8217;s enemy to distract His people from this economy.<h2 class=head2>Not Distracted by Other Biblical Things</h2><p>The teaching in the New Testament is focused on God&#8217;s economy, His dispensation. However, during the centuries following the completion of the Bible, there have been many teachings which have not been on God&#8217;s economy. This should be a warning to us. We need to learn from history not to teach anything other than God&#8217;s dispensation.<p>In 1 Timothy 1 Paul presents God&#8217;s economy in opposition to different teachings. According to Paul&#8217;s word here some were teaching the law and genealogies rather than God&#8217;s economy. In the Bible the law is a major subject. Judaism was built upon the law, and the Judaizers were zealous for the law and were wholly given to it. The Bible also contains many genealogies, such as the genealogy of Abraham and the genealogy of David. In verse 4 the word genealogies probably refers to Old Testament genealogies adorned with fables (Titus 3:9).<p>There are many other matters in the Bible, such as the history and the prophecies, which can become distractions to us. Some are distracted from God&#8217;s economy through their readings of the Psalms or Proverbs. If as we read the Bible we are not under the control of a clear vision of God&#8217;s economy, we may be distracted not by heresies but by various things found in the Bible. When you hear this you may question whether biblical things can become distractions. It is a fact of history that throughout the centuries nearly all Christians have been distracted from God&#8217;s economy by different biblical things.<p>We must take heed to Paul&#8217;s charge not to teach differently from God&#8217;s economy. We believe that since the time of the apostles God&#8217;s economy has not been stressed as much as it has been stressed in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, especially in the past twenty years. God has a great plan-to dispense Himself in His Trinity into His chosen people. This is God&#8217;s economy. Our teaching must be governed by a clear view of God&#8217;s economy. Whatever we teach should be related to God&#8217;s economy.<h2 class=head2>God&#8217;s Economy Being Our Unique Burden, View, and Vision</h2><p>As you teach in the Summer School of Truth, you should not have any burden, any view, or any vision other than God&#8217;s economy. You need to be not only burdened with God&#8217;s economy but also soaked and saturated with God&#8217;s economy. In your teaching you should know only one thing-God&#8217;s economy. You should be able to declare, &#8220;God&#8217;s economy is my burden, my view, and my vision. My entire being has been soaked in God&#8217;s economy, and I know nothing else.&#8221; To be sure, you will teach many different lessons, but every lesson will be structured with God&#8217;s economy. Only when you are clear concerning this basic matter will you know what we intend to do in the Summer School of Truth.<h2 class=head1>FANNING INTO FLAME THE GIFT OF GOD</h2><p>We have pointed out that in 2 Timothy 2:2 Paul charged Timothy to commit to faithful men the things which he had heard from Paul. These faithful men should be those who are competent to teach others. In order to fulfill this commission, Timothy himself had to be on fire. This is the reason Paul reminded him to &#8220;fan into flame the gift of God&#8221; which was in him (1:6).<h2 class=head2>The Divine Life and the Divine Spirit</h2><p>At this juncture we need to ask a question: What was the gift of God that Timothy was charged to fan into flame? The Pentecostal people might say that this was the gift of speaking in tongues, but this is doubtful, especially in view of the fact that in Paul&#8217;s latest writings the miraculous things are rarely mentioned. I believe that, first, the gift in verse 6 is the gift of eternal life. A gift, of course, must be given by someone. God surely has given us something, and the first thing that He has given us is the divine life. We all have received eternal life, the divine life. I also believe that, second, the gift here is the gift of the divine Spirit. The eternal life and the divine Spirit, or the eternal Spirit, are both God Himself.<h2 class=head2>Bringing in the Draft by Opening Our Entire Being</h2><p>This understanding of the gift in verse 6 raises another question: How is it possible for us to fan the Holy Spirit? Christians usually think that the Holy Spirit fans us, that the Holy Spirit fans our spirit. Do we fan the Spirit or does the Spirit fan us? Concerning this matter of fanning into flame the gift of God, we may still be under the influence of traditional Christian teaching. According to traditional teaching, the believers are told to ask for the Spirit, not to fan the Spirit. To ask for something implies that we do not have that thing. Hence, to ask for the Spirit implies that we do not have the Spirit. To fan the Spirit, on the contrary, implies that we have the Spirit already. The &#8220;fire&#8221; of the Spirit is in us as the &#8220;stove,&#8221; but in order for the fire to burn, there is the need of a &#8220;draft.&#8221; To fan the flame is to bring in the needed draft. This illustration may give you an idea about what it means to fan the Spirit as the gift of God within us.<p>God has given us two precious things-His divine life and His divine Spirit. Now we need to fan the gift of God into flame. The first step in fanning the gift is not to exercise; the first step is to open all the &#8220;doors&#8221; and &#8220;windows.&#8221; We need to open our entire being. Open your mind, emotion, and will. Open your entire soul, open your heart, and open your spirit. Every morning we need to go to the Lord and open ourselves to Him. However, often we may spend time with the Lord without opening our being to Him. In such a situation the fire does not burn.<p>Those who teach in the Summer School of Truth must open their entire being-spirit, heart, soul, mind, emotion and will-so that the &#8220;draft&#8221; may come in. The Spirit is in you already, but you need to fan the fire, the Spirit, into flame. I am somewhat concerned that when you go to teach a class in our summer school, you will be a shut-up person, a person whose being is closed to the draft. You have the Spirit and eternal life within you, but because you are closed the draft cannot come in. If you are this kind of person, you will teach the young people merely according to your knowledge or according to what is printed in the lesson book. That kind of teaching is deadening. Before you go to teach, you must first fan the gift into flame. The more you open, the more the fire will burn. The draft from your fanning may cause the fire to burn for hours or even for the whole day.<h2 class=head2>Calling on the Name of the Lord Jesus and Exercising Our Spirit</h2><p>In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul told Timothy to &#8220;pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&#8221; If your being is closed, you need to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. As you call on the Lord, open not only your mouth but also your spirit and your heart. Then the draft will come in, and that will fan into flame the eternal life and the eternal Spirit within you. Fan into flame the gift which you have received from God. Let the gift become a flame. Then go to teach the young people not with an &#8220;ice-cold&#8221; mind but with a flame. If you are too sober in your mind, you will be cold ice when you go to teach. Do not be cold! Be &#8220;boiling hot&#8221; with the gift that has been fanned into flame!<p>Thus far, we have seen that we should teach God&#8217;s economy and that we should fan into flame the gift of God, opening our whole being and calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. In addition, we surely need to exercise our spirit. After charging Timothy to fan into flame the gift of God, Paul went on to say, &#8220;For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness&#8221; (1:7). The spirit here denotes our spirit, regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit (John 3:6; Rom. 8:16). To fan into flame the gift of God is thus related to our regenerated spirit. Of power refers to our will; of love, to our emotion; and of sobermindedness, to our mind. This indicates that having a strong will, a loving emotion, and a sober mind has very much to do with having a strong spirit for the exercise of the gift of God that is in us.<h2 class=head1>BRINGING IN A SPIRIT OF PRAYER</h2><p>We all should be those who teach God&#8217;s economy, who fan the gift of God into flame, who call on the name of the Lord Jesus, and who exercise our spirit. At this point we need to consider another crucial matter-being persons of prayer.<p>I have no doubt that, as believers in Christ, you have received the eternal life and the divine Spirit, but I am concerned that you will go to your class with &#8220;ice water&#8221; instead of a flame. We have emphasized the fact that to have a flame you need to let the draft come in through opening up to the Lord. Every morning you need to bring in the draft by fanning the gift of God into flame. However, suppose that you have just had a most unpleasant situation with your spouse, and now it seems impossible for you to fan the flame. It may take several days for you to be able once again to fan the flame by yourself, but this will be much easier to do if you pray with a small group of saints. If you pray by yourself, you may keep thinking about the situation with your spouse and thus have no way to fan the flame. However, if you pray with others, they will fan the flame within you. Eventually you also will be able to pray and you will fan them. Then the draft will come in, and you will have a flame.<p>If you would go to your class in the Summer School of Truth with a flame, you must be a person of prayer. If you are such a person, you will bring a spirit of prayer to your class. You will then be able to stir up the praying spirit of the young people in your class. Everyone must be stirred up to pray. This means that you need to create an atmosphere of prayer. Do not teach unless there is such an atmosphere in your class. To have an atmosphere of prayer, you should allow an adequate time in every class session for prayer.<p>Do you know what a living meeting is? A living meeting is a meeting that has an atmosphere of prayer. All those who speak for the Lord know that it is easy to speak in a meeting where there is an atmosphere of prayer. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to speak, for you may feel as if you are speaking in a cemetery.<p>I would remind you that teaching in the Summer School of Truth is absolutely different from teaching in a secular school. There is no need to fan the gift of God into flame in order to teach a class in a secular school. But to teach in our summer school, you must be a person of prayer, a person with a flame who brings in an atmosphere of prayer.<h2 class=head1>TEACHING NOT IN A DOCTRINAL WAY BUT IN AN EXPERIENTIAL WAY</h2><p>Once you have fanned the gift of God into flame, stirred up the praying spirit, and created an atmosphere of prayer, you are now ready to teach. You should teach not in a doctrinal way but in an experiential way.<h2 class=head2>Applying All the Points of the Teaching to Practical, Personal Experience</h2><p>Suppose you are teaching a lesson on man&#8217;s fallen condition and man&#8217;s need of salvation. You should not ask your students merely to remember and recite all the points related to man&#8217;s fallen condition. That would be to teach in a doctrinal way. If you would teach in an experiential way, you should help the young people to realize that they themselves are fallen. You may ask them to paint a picture of their own fallen condition, not just to remember a number of doctrinal points. Take, for example, the matter of lying. Concerning this, those in your class should come to realize that, because they were born in sin, there is no need for them to learn how to lie; they lie spontaneously. To teach in this way is to teach not according to doctrine but according to experience.<p>One of the points in the lesson on man&#8217;s need of salvation is that man is under God&#8217;s condemnation. Man has sinned by disobeying God&#8217;s commandment and thus has come under God&#8217;s condemnation. If you teach in a doctrinal way, you will ask questions such as the following: What is God&#8217;s commandment? What does it mean to be condemned? What is the significance of being under God&#8217;s condemnation? If you would teach in an experiential way, you must help your students to realize that they have sinned by disobeying particular commandments. Furthermore, you should point out to them that often they have disobeyed the demands of their conscience. You may ask them, &#8220;Can you say that you have never disobeyed your conscience? If you have disobeyed your conscience, then surely you have sinned.&#8221; By speaking to them in this way, you will help them to realize experientially what it means to be under God&#8217;s judgment.<p>Learn in your teaching to touch others experientially. Apply every point of your teaching to their personal, practical situation.<h2 class=head2>Not Giving Lectures but Talking in a Personal Way</h2><p>As you are teaching the young people in your class, you should frequently talk to them in a personal and practical way. For instance, you might say, &#8220;Are you not unhappy when your brother or sister has something that you do not have? Do you not hate that? Also, have you not offended your parents many times? Do you not have a sense deep within that it is wrong to offend your parents? Do you not realize that you should honor, respect, regard, and love your parents?&#8221; Instead of only covering the points in the lesson book, talk to the young people in a very personal way. Every point of the lesson should be presented in a way that will create an experiential impression. Apply every point to their actual situation.<p>When you teach a class in the Summer School of Truth, do not take the way of giving messages or lectures. Instead, you need to have personal talks with the young people, teaching every point experientially. As you are talking with them, you should be watchful over each one, paying particular attention to their expressions. This will help you to know the needs of your students. Then in the next class session you should endeavor to meet these needs. As the Lord leads you, you may speak to certain ones in particular and then ask them to pray with you. In this way you will help them to open up, you will strengthen their praying spirit, and you will bring them into the experience of the truths which you are presenting.<p>The principle is the same with preaching the gospel. When we preach the gospel, we should not just gather people together and give them a message. We should have direct, personal contact with people. We may give a message, but afterward, according to the condition of the attendants, we need to talk with them in a personal way about their need. Then we should pray with them. We all need to learn to do this.<h2 class=head2>Stirring Up a Praying Spirit</h2><p>The hardest thing for us to do in teaching in an experiential way is to get people to pray with us. You may be able to give a message and talk with others, but when you come to the point where it is necessary to pray, you may be void of the praying spirit. If you are void of the praying spirit, you cannot stir up a praying spirit in someone else. If you want to stir up a praying spirit in the person with whom you are speaking, you yourself must be a person who is full of the praying spirit.<p>I hope that there will be much prayer in your class in the Summer School of Truth. Adequate prayer will accomplish at least three things. It will impress the young people in an experiential way with the points of the lesson; it will stir up the praying spirit within them; and it will cause them to become living. Those who attend such a summer school will surely become very living.<p>Let us not merely train the young people in our summer school with the knowledge of truth. Mere doctrinal knowledge is vain, and I have no confidence in it. Rather, let us impress the young ones with truth as the reality of God&#8217;s economy. This is the truth which we are burdened to impart to our young people. In order to carry out this burden, you need to put into practice all the points we have covered in this message. Be governed by a clear view of God&#8217;s economy; fan into flame the gift of God which is within you; and be a person of prayer with an atmosphere of prayer who can stir up a praying spirit in others. As a teacher in the Summer School of Truth, you should be ready to pray at any time. Then you will be able to teach.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>KNOWING THE STRUCTURE OF THE TRUTH, BEING SATURATED WITH THE TRUTH, AND CONVERTING DOCTRINE INTO EXPERIENCE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 2:4; 3:15; 2 Tim. 2:15, 25</h1><p>The books of 1 and 2 Timothy were written to deal with the church&#8217;s decline and to inoculate the believers against this decline. This is true especially of 2 Timothy, which was written at a time when the churches established through Paul&#8217;s ministry in the Gentile world were in a trend of degradation. That situation was a prefigure of the situation of decline in today&#8217;s Christianity. Because of the influence of this decline, we need to train our young people with everything that Paul taught Timothy. This kind of teaching will be a strong inoculation against the decline and degradation of the church. The fact that Paul wrote concerning &#8220;the last days&#8221; (2 Tim. 3:1) indicates his writing applied not only to his time but applies also to the times in which we live. We all need to be inoculated against the decline by knowing the truth revealed in these two books.<h2 class=head1>THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH</h2><p>The matter of truth is emphasized strongly in 1 and 2 Timothy. Paul tells us that God &#8220;desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth&#8221; (1 Tim. 2:4). The church&#8217;s decline was due to the lack of the adequate knowledge of the truth. In 1 Timothy the decline crept in subtly through different teachings (1:3), and in 2 Timothy it developed openly and even worsened through heresies (2:16-18). To deal with such a decline, the truth must be maintained. First Timothy emphasizes that God desires all His saved ones to have the full knowledge of the truth and that the church is the pillar and base of the truth (3:15). Second Timothy stresses that the word of the truth should be unfolded rightly and straightly without distortion (2:15) and that the ones who have deviated should return to the truth (v. 25).<p>Unfortunately, the word truth has been wrongly understood. Many readers of the Bible regard truth as a matter of doctrine. In the New Testament, especially in 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy, truth refers not to doctrine but to the real things revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God&#8217;s New Testament economy. If we would have the proper understanding of the word truth in the New Testament, we need to realize that it denotes all the realities of the divine economy as the content of the divine revelation, conveyed and disclosed by the holy Word (see note 6 on 1 John 1:6).<h2 class=head1>THE STRUCTURE OF THE TRUTH BEING THE TRIUNE GOD WITH HIS ALL-INCLUSIVE REDEMPTION</h2><p>Before you begin to teach the young people in the Summer School of Truth, you yourself need to receive Paul&#8217;s inoculation and be filled, soaked, and saturated with the truth. If you study 1 and 2 Timothy carefully, you will see that the structure of these two books is actually the structure of the truth and that the structure of the truth is the element of Paul&#8217;s inoculation.<p>What is the element of this inoculation? What is the structure of the truth? Through a careful reading of 1 and 2 Timothy we can realize that the structure of the truth is the Triune God with His all-inclusive redemption. God&#8217;s redemption implies, or includes, salvation. Redemption has been accomplished by God. When God&#8217;s accomplished redemption is applied to us, it becomes salvation. Thus, salvation is our experience of God&#8217;s redemption. The structure of the divine truth is nothing less than the Triune God plus His redemption, which becomes our salvation.<p>In order to teach the young people in a living way, you need to learn all the aspects of the truth in the Scriptures concerning the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This means that you need to become saturated with the truth, the reality, of the Divine Trinity. Furthermore, you need to dive into the truth regarding the divine redemption-how it was planned by the Father, how it was accomplished by the Son, and how it is applied by the Spirit. Then you need to have a clear view of how the redemption accomplished by the Triune God becomes our full salvation.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S FULL SALVATION</h2><p>The general subject of the first series of lessons in the Summer School of Truth is God&#8217;s full salvation. The full salvation of God is actually equal to the truth, because the Triune God with His all-inclusive redemption is the structure of the truth. Through Paul&#8217;s writings this truth has become an inoculation against the decline of Christianity. On the one hand, we may speak of the structure of the truth; on the other hand, we may speak of the element of the inoculation. This inoculation is like a dose of medicine containing various elements. The elements in the &#8220;dose&#8221; ministered by Paul as an inoculation are the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-and His all-inclusive redemption.<p>In helping the young people to experience God&#8217;s full salvation, you have to unveil to them their fallen condition, which involves sin, Satan, and the world, the satanic system. These negative things are related to the actual condition of the saved ones. If we would experience and enjoy God&#8217;s full salvation, we should consider our condition and its involvement, with sin, Satan, the world, and many other negative things.<h2 class=head1>PREPARING YOURSELF TO TEACH BY BEING SATURATED WITH THE TRUTH OF GOD&#8217;S ECONOMY</h2><p>As you prepare yourself to teach, you should not merely put your trust in the lesson book nor in the compendium. You need to immerse yourself in the truth concerning God&#8217;s full salvation. This means that you need to be saturated with a thorough knowledge, realization, and experience of the Triune God with His all-inclusive redemption in relation to all the aspects of man&#8217;s fallen condition. To prepare yourself to teach, it is not adequate simply to read the lesson book. As a teacher in the Summer School of Truth, you need to be soaked and saturated with the truth. I hope that you will be impressed with your need to dive into the divine truth, which is the reality of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit and of His all-inclusive redemption understood in relation to the condition of fallen man.<p>When you hear this, you may be troubled and feel that you are not qualified to teach the young people. I would urge you not to feel this way. Your experience may be limited, but the amount of experience you have qualifies you.<p>In your teaching do not speak peculiar things to arouse people&#8217;s curiosity. Also, do not make a display of your knowledge about other subjects, such as history or science. It is shameful to make a display. You must be focused on God&#8217;s economy and be restricted by God&#8217;s economy. All of the class time, which is actually quite limited, should be used for presenting the truth of God&#8217;s economy.<p>Once again I wish to point out that you need to be fully soaked and saturated with the divine truth. The summer school should be a school not only to the students but also to all the teachers. I hope that you yourself will be the first one to learn the truth. You cannot teach others without first being taught yourself. Likewise, you cannot minister a certain thing to others without first experiencing and enjoying that matter yourself. You can minister to others only what you yourself have enjoyed. Otherwise, your teaching will be merely doctrinal and thus will be in vain.<h2 class=head1>TEACHING IN AN EXPERIENTIAL WAY RATHER THAN IN A DOCTRINAL WAY</h2><p>Let us now go on to consider the practical matter of teaching in an experiential way rather than in a doctrinal way. Suppose you are teaching lesson seventeen on transformation. The lesson book says, &#8220;Transformation is the result of sanctification and is related to man&#8217;s soul.&#8221; To ask the students merely to understand and remember the facts is to teach in a doctrinal way. If you would teach in an experiential way, you should fellowship with the young people regarding why transformation is the result of sanctification. By doing this you will turn your teaching from doctrine to experience. This experiential fellowship will deeply impress them.<p>As you speak in this way about why transformation is the result of sanctification, one of the students might offer an explanation. He might say that sanctification separates us, changes us, and causes us to become holy with God&#8217;s holy nature and that the result is a metabolic change, which is transformation. If someone speaks in this way, you should immediately ask him certain questions: &#8220;How about you? Have you been changed with God&#8217;s holy nature? Has your being been made holy by the divine nature?&#8221; This way of teaching is experiential.<p>However, if you have not been soaked in the truth concerning sanctification and if you have not had any experience of sanctification, you have no choice other than to teach people doctrinally. You will be able to do nothing more than simply repeat what you have read in the lesson book. Having been &#8220;educated&#8221; with doctrine in letters, you will then teach the doctrine that transformation is the result of sanctification and is related to man&#8217;s soul. But neither you nor the students will know the truth, the reality, of sanctification and transformation. Since you do not have any experience, you cannot minister life to the young people in your class. Rather, you will pass on mere knowledge, as if you were teaching in a theological school. If you teach in this way, you will ruin the summer school and even damage your students.<h2 class=head1>CONVERTING DOCTRINE INTO EXPERIENCE</h2><p>In order to teach in an experiential way, you must convert every point in the lesson from doctrine into experience. Suppose a particular lesson has five points. In your preparation, you should try to convert every point of doctrine into experience. This requires practice. After making such a conversion during your time of preparation, you should then speak to the young people about each point in the way of experience. The more you speak in this way, the more they will be unveiled. They will see a vision that will expose them, and spontaneously they will be ushered into the experience of the very matter you have been presenting.<p>However, if you teach in the way of merely imparting doctrines from the printed materials, you will do nothing more than impart some knowledge to the minds of your students. As a result, they will gain nothing in an experiential way. Moreover, the knowledge they gain may damage them. Later, on another occasion, when they hear a word about transformation, they might say, &#8220;I know this already. I heard all about it in the Summer School of Truth. I know that transformation is the result of sanctification and is related to man&#8217;s soul. I also know that transformation means that a certain substance changes in nature and in form.&#8221; We must not damage the young people by giving them mere knowledge. In order to profit them with the truth, we must always teach them in an experiential way. This is a very basic matter.<p>We should also speak in an experiential way in the church life. In the meetings, in fellowship, in shepherding the saints, and in visiting others for gospel preaching, we need to learn to speak not in a doctrinal way but in an experiential way. By speaking in this way, we will &#8220;hit two birds with one stone&#8221;-the &#8220;bird&#8221; of experience and the &#8220;bird&#8221; of doctrine. Then the one to whom you are speaking will get the doctrine along with the experience. I hope that you all will endeavor to practice this from now on.<p>In the ministry in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we present our teachings not in the way of doctrine but in the way of life. For this reason our study of the Bible is called a life-study. However, although we do not stress doctrine, our way of teaching conveys a great deal of doctrine. Every message of our life-study of the Scriptures conveys a certain amount of doctrine, yet the impression made upon the reader is not the impression of doctrine but the impression of the experience and enjoyment of God, Christ, and the Spirit. Eventually one does learn some doctrine, but it is experiential doctrine, doctrine that is learned through experience.<p>I believe that teaching in the Summer School of Truth will be a good opportunity for you to learn something. If you try to convert every point in the lessons into experience, you yourself will be helped. You may realize that you do not know how to convert doctrine into experience, because you are lacking in experience. This will expose you, and then you will know where you are. You will see that you may know many things as doctrines, but you do not know them in experience. Then as you are preparing a lesson, you may begin to check yourself regarding your experience. Point by point you may ask yourself, &#8220;Do I have the experience of this matter? Is my experience of this point adequate? Am I able to teach others about this point in an experiential way?&#8221; You may conclude that your experience is not even adequate for a testimony, much less for teaching a class of young people. This may cause you to pray, &#8220;Lord, have mercy upon me. I need some experience of this matter.&#8221; This is the way to prepare yourself to teach every lesson.<p>I would encourage you to prepare not only by yourself but with others who will be teaching the young people. Come together with several others and check every point of every lesson according to experience. In addition, practice converting the doctrinal points into experience. This will be a good preparation for teaching in an experiential way. If you do this, the summer school will be a great benefit not only to the young people but to the entire church. Let us take this way to teach the young people in the Summer School of Truth.</body></html>
