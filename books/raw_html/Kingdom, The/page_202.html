<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Harvest of Grapes</H2><P>In the Old Testament the kingdom was a matter of prophecy. But in the New Testament it is a matter of fulfillment. Revelation 14 reveals both the firstfruit and the harvest. In addition to this harvest of wheat, there is also a harvest of grapes. In God's eyes there are two fields or farms on the earth. One is the wheat farm representing His people. The other is the vine farm growing grapes representing the worldly people. The Christians are likened to wheat, and the unbelievers are likened to grapes. According to Revelation 14:17-20, the clusters of the vine of the earth were gathered and cast into the great winepress of the fury of God. The winepress was trodden outside the city, and the blood came out of the winepress up to the bridles of the horses. It does not say that the juice of the grape came out, but that the blood came out. Furthermore, it says that the blood came out up to the horses' bridles. This indicates many horses will be there. The blood became a deep current for about two hundred miles. Millions of people of the armies of the earth will be put into this winepress and trodden like grapes.</P><P>Who will tread this great winepress? By reading Isaiah 63:1-6 we can see that it is the Lord Himself who will tread the winepress. That will be the day of the vengeance of the Lord; He will tread down the people in His anger, make them drunk in His fury, and bring down their strength to the earth. This will be the reaping of the grapes, the unbelievers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Armageddon</H2><P>Now we need to read Revelation 16:12-16: "And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared. And I saw, out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs; for they are spirits of demons, doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty. (Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments, that he may not walk naked and they see his shame.) And they gathered them to the place which in Hebrew is called, Armageddon." The beast mentioned here is the Antichrist. While the Gentiles are preparing and collecting an army, the Lord Jesus will sound out a warning to the believers. This portion indicates that there will be believers still left on the earth at that time.</P><P>Armageddon, meaning the Mount of Mageddon, is very close to Bozrah and Jahazah. The mount and the valley are quite close to one another. This indicates that at the very time the Lord Jesus will be coming back, the three evil spirits will go out to stir up the people from the Far East. Verse 12 says, "That the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared." The kings from the rising of the sun will not be Europeans or people from the Middle East, but they will be from the east of the Euphrates.</P><P>Now we need to read Revelation 9:13-18: "And the sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates. And the four angels were loosed who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they might kill the third part of men. And the number of cavalry troops was two hundred million. I heard their number. And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting on them, having breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of sulphur; and the heads of the horses were as heads of lions; and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and sulphur. The third part of men was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur proceeding out of their mouths." The river Euphrates is mentioned also in this portion. It says that one-third of the part of men will be killed and that the number of cavalry troops will be two hundred million.</P>
