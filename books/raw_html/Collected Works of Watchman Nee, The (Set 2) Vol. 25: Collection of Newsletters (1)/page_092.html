<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COLLECTION OF NEWS FROM WENCHOW,<br>P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</H2><P>Greetings to the editor of Collection of Newsletters:</P><P>I have received letters from a few brothers and sisters concerning the work in various places and prayer requests. I would not have sent them to you except for the request you made in your publication that any news of the work should be communicated as much as possible. For this reason, five letters for publication are enclosed. Please do not follow your emotions in deciding whether or not to publish them. If you accept them, please correct any mistakes before publication. I bless you with peace, health, and joy!</P><P>From,<br>Wu Sheng</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from<br>Ya Yang, Tai Shun, Chekiang</H2><P>Peace to my brother in the Lord, Brother Wu Sheng:</P><P>These five days of meetings in Ya Yang were especially blessed by the Lord. The messages preached were "The Kingdom of the Heavens." Brothers and sisters came from ten different localities. There were about two hundred people in the meetings, and they all were in one accord. Please pray for this time of the work. I am still in Ya Yang resting. If there are any books and letters for me, please give them to this brother from Tai Shun. Are there any matters in the meeting in Ch'iao Tun that need to be prayed for? If there are, please notify me so I can ask the brothers and sisters who love the Lord in Ya Yang to pray. Moreover, Brother Lai Kung Ho translated for me during our recent labor in Ya Ying. I was very released in my speaking. Mr. Ts'ai Ts'e Wu (also known as Mr. Chi Ch'ing) came to the meetings to hear the messages. He is in one accord with us. Please pray for him. I bless you with peace in the Lord!</P><P>From the Ya Yang Meeting Hall,<br>Wang Yu T'ing<br>March 27, 1934</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Letter from<br>Ko Ling, Tai Shun, Chekiang</H2><P>Greetings to Brother Chang Wu Sheng:</P><P>Although I have not seen you or greeted you since we parted, I met with you in prayer. May the Lord bless you with peace. Brother, in the midst of great trial last year, I still maintained my full joy. In a time of extreme poverty, I experienced the manifestation of abundant grace and love. Thank the Lord. (Parts omitted.)</P><P>At the conference in Shanghai, the year before last, Mr. Nee said to me that I should not be so anxious. I have not been anxious. I have only prayed with an earnest heart and tears. You have also prayed for me. Thank the Lord, I received a revelation from God in my prayer to read all of Ephesians 1, Hebrews 11:24-31; 12:1-2, and Joshua 3:4 and verse 14 to the end of the chapter. As a result, I received the teaching of the Scripture. I also asked the Lord to use the environment to restrict me, and He did. Now I have "come out from among them" and have left the realm of being a hired employee in the denominations. I really praise God. I have already ceased my own soulish work and have returned home to read the Bible, pray, and wait. I ask you and the brothers and sisters to thank God for what He has done for me. If the Lord is willing, I hope to come to you soon and meet with you to talk about the Lord's grace. May glory be to the Lord's name and blessings and peace be to us. Amen.</P><P>Your brother,<br>Wang Chu You<br>May 1</P>
