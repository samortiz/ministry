   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE NINETEEN THE MINISTRY OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HUMAN VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH HIS DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN GALILEE 9 Scripture Reading: Luke 8:22-56</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we come to 8:22-56.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This portion of the Gospel of Luke covers three matters: the quelling of the storm 8:22-25 , the casting out of a legion of demons vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>26-39 , and the healing of a woman with a flow of blood and the raising up of a dead girl vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>40-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE JOURNEY ORDAINED BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These three matters are put together not only in Luke but also in Mark and Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Mark they are put together in order to show the authority of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By the authority of the kingdom, the storm is calmed, the demons are defeated, the sick are healed, and the dead are raised.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Matthew the same three matters are put together in order to show a dispensational change.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in Luke these things are put together in order to show the journey we must make as those who believe in the Lord Jesus and follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have seen from 7:36 8:21 that the Christian life begins with the forgiveness of sins and continues with living in peace, following the Lord, ministering to His need, and growing in life so that we may shine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, we become the Lord s real relatives, His members.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then in 8:22-56 Luke goes on to show that those who believe in the Lord are on a journey with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This journey is not chosen by us; rather, it is ordained by the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Luke 8:22 indicates that the journey of which we are speaking is ordained by the Lord: And it came about on one of the days that He got into a boat, and His disciples; and He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake; and they launched out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we see that the Lord told the disciples to go over to the other side of the lake.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that the journey was not initiated by the disciples, but was ordained by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates further that after we become the Lord s relatives, the members of His Body, we do not have the right to choose our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead, we must take the way chosen by Him, the way ordained by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The disciples, therefore, launched out at the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said, Let us go over to the other side of the lake, and they took His word and launched out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Rebuking the Wind</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>and the Raging of the Water</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verses 23 and 24 tell us what happened on the journey: And as they sailed, He fell asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And a whirlwind came down upon the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And He, being awakened, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we see that while the Lord was asleep, a whirlwind came down upon the lake, and the boat was being filled with water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The disciples were frightened and called on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why did the Lord rebuke the wind and the raging of the water?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why would He rebuke something that is without life?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He rebuked the wind and the water because behind them were evil spirits and demons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The evil spirits are in the air, and the demons are in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both the evil spirits and the demons follow Satan and trouble us in our journey as we follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that the evil spirits and the demons will cause a storm to frustrate us in our journey.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 25 says, And He said to them, Where is your faith?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And they were afraid and marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we see that after quelling the storm, the Lord rebuked the disciples, asking them, Where is your faith?</S>
