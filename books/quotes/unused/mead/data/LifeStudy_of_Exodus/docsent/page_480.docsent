   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THE GOLDEN INCENSE ALTAR 4 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:6-10; 40:5, 26-27; Psa 84:3; 141:2; Rev 8:3-6; Exo 30:26-28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we emphasized three important matters related to the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, when we pray, we need to be in the tabernacle, which signifies the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, in order to pray at the incense altar, we must first be filled and satisfied by eating the holy food, our portion of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, when we pray, we should offer incense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have a clear view of these matters, our prayer life will be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead of being occupied in prayer with material needs or personal concerns, we shall pray for the executing of God s purpose, for the carrying out of the divine administration, and for the dispensing of God s supplying grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>PRAYER RELATED</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>TO CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matthew 6:33 is a verse often quoted by today s Christians: But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that if we seek God s kingdom and His righteousness, whatever we need food, clothing, housing will be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows that there is no need for us to be occupied in our prayer with things such as food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, we should pray for God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the kingdom of God today?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s kingdom is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But what is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, to seek God s kingdom is to seek Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to Matthew 6:33 we should also seek God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is God s righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s righteousness is Christ expressed through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, to seek God s kingdom and His righteousness is to seek Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our prayer should be related to God s kingdom and His righteousness, that is, to Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is sad is that many Christians know how to pray for a better job, a larger house, or their safety on a journey, but they do not know how to pray for Christ or the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When some pray for the church, they do not pray directly for the church, but instead pray for business matters related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should forget about praying in such a way and pray instead for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When some Christians hear this word regarding their prayer life, they may say, This word is troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems that you are robbing me of all my prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After hearing this word, I don t know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems that any way I try to pray is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A SERIOUS PROHIBITION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I encourage you to read again this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should burn incense upon the golden altar.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, there is a serious prohibition: we must not burn strange incense.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only the resurrected and ascended Christ is acceptable; everything else is prohibited.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not burn strange incense, and we should not even burn at the incense altar what is acceptable to God at the offering altar.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that we should not present the crucified and judged Christ at the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we must burn as incense the resurrected and ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must present such a living Christ to God as incense at the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If some saints were to ask me to tell them how to pray, I would not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I told you how to pray and you prayed accordingly, that kind of prayer would still not be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may use the right terminology, but you may still be praying outside of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You would not be praying in God, in the center of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, while you are praying, you may not have the inner satisfaction or the inner energizing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that you do not have God praying in you as you are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we pray, we need to pray in God, and we need to pray with God energizing us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we need to offer Christ to God and pray Him to God.</S>
