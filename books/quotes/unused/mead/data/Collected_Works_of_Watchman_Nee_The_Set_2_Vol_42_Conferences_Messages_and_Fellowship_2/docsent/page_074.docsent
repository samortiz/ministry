   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN-MADE VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians realize that they are not living the life that God has ordained for them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet they desire to live an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They aspire to overcome their temper, fleshly lusts, unclean thoughts, and pride.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They employ all kinds of means, hoping that they will reach God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, their methods do not bring them the victory that the Bible speaks of.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us consider the great difference between man's thought and God's thought, and the great difference between man's work and God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can use temper as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Temper is a common sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 13 is on love; both the first and last sentence relate to endurance or longsuffering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being patient is not losing one's temper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are a few common ways that man uses to deal with his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppression</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppressing one's temper is like trying to seal the lid of a bottle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When one's temper is about to burst, he tries to suppress it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He tries to swallow his anger.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But swallowing one's anger is not genuine endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In her book, The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life, Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith mentioned the example of a girl who stayed with her aunt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day someone rebuked her aunt for no reason, yet the aunt continued to smile.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The girl saw this and afterwards admired her aunt, saying, "All my life I have admired your patience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I had to talk to such an unreasonable person, my anger would flare up immediately."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The aunt replied, "Perhaps there is something you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not think that I was not angry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although anger did not come out of my mouth, my heart was burning with anger."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A brother was hit once by another Christian on the cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "I will overcome by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ has given me the power to overcome."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet in his heart he was cursing the one who hit him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not genuine victory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The victory that the Bible speaks of is a victory that does not become agitated in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Stephen's victory was a victory in which he prayed for his persecutors; he did not have any feelings of revenge whatsoever Acts 7:60 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Genuine victory is one that is not touched or moved by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Swallowing one's anger is a man-made victory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Victory is not a matter of mustering one's strength to suppress oneself in the hope of not sinning and of attaining to perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Victory is a matter of inward transcendency before God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It has no animosity whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Taming the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The most common way to tame the flesh is by trying to mellow the temper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Chinese have an idiomatic expression that describes this: "Taming the dragons and subduing the tigers."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the way many people suppress their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They try to turn a wild horse into a tame horse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people think that what they need is more time to tame their temper and cultivate their character.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They think that victory is the ability to tame themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I was in Peking, I met a brother who was over seventy years old.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He had a quick temper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I asked him, "How was your temper thirty-nine years ago?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He answered, "Thirty-nine years ago, my temper was much worse than it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am over seventy years old, and my temper is naturally more subdued."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not genuine victory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The victory that the Lord gives is always instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your salvation is instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Your victory is also instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Both your salvation and victory are works that the Lord has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You do not become subdued slowly, and you do not improve gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once I was in a restaurant, and I accidently spilled some soy sauce onto a waiter's clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In front of everyone he said, "It does not matter, sir."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But behind my back he cursed me, saying, "This man has his eyes in the wrong place!"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the victory most Christians talk about today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is man-made victory and is worthless in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Warring with Sin</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Another group of people deal with sin by wrestling with it and trying to withstand it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They struggle to oppose sin in the hope that they will overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yet their striving, struggling, and wrestling eventually end in nothing but failure.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These people often think that they have failed because they did not fight with sin long enough and were not resolute enough in rejecting sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They try to fight harder the next time, and they do their best to withstand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet how many people have we seen who have overcome their sin through wrestling with it?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Bible tells us to withstand the devil, but it never tells us to withstand temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It tells us to withstand evil, but it never tells us to withstand sin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>None of our temptations and trials can be overcome through withstanding them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A young brother was working for the Lord in a certain locality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once while he was conducting a meeting and was helping others to have the overcoming experience, a seventy-nine-year-old doctor came and listened to his preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This doctor had been smoking cigars for fifty-one years.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He told others, "Smoking is my habit; I have been smoking since my youth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Originally I smoked twelve cigars a day.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now I have increased to twenty a day.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have been smoking for fifty-one years, and there is no way that I can overcome it."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The young brother asked, "How do you deal with it?"</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The doctor said, "I have been wrestling with smoking for over twenty years but have never succeeded."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Another young brother who was there smiled and said, "I overcame without any wrestling on my part.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you want to overcome sin, you can never do it by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You have to trust in God's deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There is no need for you to struggle in yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The brother proceeded to explain to the doctor the way of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In the end they prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In his prayer the doctor said, "Lord, from now on, I will stop all my wrestling.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Lord, I trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Victory is Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I cannot overcome by wrestling with my own strength."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Three months later, he testified, saying, "I have been smoking for fifty-one years.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Yet in an instant I was delivered from it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Formerly, when I woke up in the morning, my hand would reach out for a cigar before I opened my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Yet on that day, I stopped suddenly; the thought for smoking was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Christ has indeed become my victory."</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Victory does not come by struggling through one's own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is Christ in us who becomes our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Victory over sin is just one small item of the work of Christ within us.</S>
