   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXAMPLE OF THE APOSTLE PAUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Surely we have been saved eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But whether or not we will be able to share in the manifestation of the kingdom is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a concluding word we need to consider the history of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, let us read 1 Corinthians 9:24-27: "Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So run, that ye may obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Surely Paul had the assurance that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet he emphatically told us that he was running the race.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the time Paul was living, there were the Greek Olympic games where people ran the races in order to receive a prize.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul used this as his example, saying that he too was running a race to receive a prize.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Philippians 3:13-15 says, "Brothers, I do not yet reckon myself to have laid hold, but one thing forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us therefore, as many as are full grown have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the time Paul wrote Philippians he was old and had been with the Lord many years; but he was not yet certain he had attained to the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only at the time of the writing of 2 Timothy, which was close to the time of his martyrdom, did he have the assurance that he had reached the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This did not mean he was not sure whether he was saved, but that he was not sure whether he had gained the reward of the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he wrote 2 Timothy he was sure that the crown of righteousness was waiting for him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is the crown to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means when the Lord comes back, Paul will be rewarded with the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must be very clear: to be saved is one thing, and to be exercised in the kingdom is another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we need to be exercised so that tomorrow we can be rewarded.</S>
