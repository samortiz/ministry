The Greek word rendered &ldquo;with&rdquo; is <i>pros</i> (used with the Greek accusative case). It is a preposition of motion, implying living, acting, in union and communion with. The eternal life which is the Son was not only with the Father, but was living and acting in union and communion with the Father in eternity. This word corresponds to John 1:1-2.</p><p>The Father is the source of the eternal life, from whom and with whom the Son was manifested as the expression of the eternal life for those the Father has chosen to partake of and enjoy this life.</p><p>Instead of trying to analyze these aspects of eternal life, we should enjoy them as &ldquo;courses&rdquo; of a spiritual meal. Eternal life is the life of God, it is the Son of God, and it was with the Father in eternity. Here we have at least four courses for our enjoyment: God, the Son of God, the Father, and eternity.</p><p>Some may wonder how to enjoy all these marvelous courses. According to my experience, the best way to enjoy them is to pray-read the Word. For example, pray-read the words &ldquo;the life of God&rdquo; found in Ephesians 4:18. As you pray-read, you may say, &ldquo;Oh, the life of God! Amen! Right now, I enjoy God, and I enjoy Him as my life. Hallelujah for God! Hallelujah for life! Hallelujah for the life of God! Hallelujah for the enjoyment of the life of God and for the enjoyment of God as life!&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">Manifested to the Apostles</h2><p>John says that the life which was with the Father was manifested to the apostles. The manifestation of eternal life includes revelation and impartation of life to men, with a view to bringing man into the eternal life, into its union and communion with the Father.</p><p>What was once hidden has been manifested to the apostles. John, one of the apostles, now opens to us the divine mysteries. If we eat the Word through pray-reading, we shall receive the benefit of the manifestation of eternal life.</p><h2 class="head2">Seen, Testified, and Reported to the Believers<br />by the Apostles</h2><p>The apostles saw eternal life, the life that was manifested, and then testified and reported this life to the believers. What they reported was not some theology or doctrine which they had heard and concerning which they had been taught, but the divine life, which they had seen and testified by their practical experiences. This divine life is a Person, the Son of God as the very embodiment of the Triune God to be our life.</p><h2 class="head2">Promised by God</h2><p>The eternal life was promised by God. First John 2:25 says, &ldquo;And this is the promise which He promised us, the eternal life.&rdquo; In the Gospel of John eternal life is promised in such verses as 3:15; 4:14; and 10:10. In Titus 1:2 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal.&rdquo; This promise of eternal life must be the promise made by the Father to the Son in eternity. It must have been that in eternity past the Father promised the Son that He would give His eternal life to His believers.</p><h2 class="head2">Released through Christ&rsquo;s Death</h2><p>Eternal life was not only promised and manifested; it was also released through Christ&rsquo;s death (John 3:14-15). The divine life was concealed, confined, in Christ. But through His death this divine life was released from within Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1, 2, & 3 John, Jude &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
