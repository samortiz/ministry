   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE RENEWING IS THE CONTINUATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE SPIRIT'S SANCTIFICATION A. Regeneration Is the Initial Step of the Spirit's Dispositional Sanctification in the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After our repentance, we believed and were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Regeneration is the initial step of the Spirit's dispositional sanctification in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sanctification follows regeneration and continues through our whole life until we reach the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This sanctifying Spirit is the sealing Spirit Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He seals us unto the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 4:30 says that we are "sealed unto the day of redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In my youth I thought the word unto meant "until."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This would mean that the Spirit seals us until our body will be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This, however is a wrong teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Unto does not mean "until."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Unto means "resulting in."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit's sealing us results in the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Until refers to the matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Unto, however, is a matter of result.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sealing of the Spirit results in the redemption of our body, which is the full sonship we will enter into with our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Following regeneration is sanctification, and sanctification implies renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Renewing is a very fine work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Titus 3:5 shows how sanctification continues regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse says that God saves us through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regeneration is a great washing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We were created as the old man, and the old man became fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even the best part of the old man is dirty and contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It has been contaminated with sin, Satan, the world, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So God came in to save us through regeneration, and this regeneration washes away the old creation with sin, Satan, the world, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>B. Renewing Is the Going On</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>of This Dispositional Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>within the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This washing needs some continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Each morning we spend some time to wash ourselves thoroughly, but throughout the day we wash again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We wash our hands and face outwardly, and we wash our inward being by drinking water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Washing needs a continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regeneration is a great washing, and our sanctification continues this washing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first step of this continuation of our being sanctified is the renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Renewing is the going on of the dispositional sanctification within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 6:19 and 22 prove that this sanctifying is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sanctifying is a kind of renewing, and this renewing is going on every day and every moment through our entire Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 19 says that we should present our members "as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means we should not let the members of our body do anything unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we present the members of our body to righteousness, this results in sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 22 says that this sanctification leads us to eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Righteousness, sanctification, and eternal life are covered in verses 19 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How can we reach eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to present our physical body in every way to righteousness, and this results in sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then sanctification leads us to eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Early in the morning we need to pray, "Lord, thank You for this day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I present myself as a burnt offering for Your satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, keep me right the whole day."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then this will be unto sanctification, and sanctification will lead you to eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Romans 6:19 and 22 show us a continual renewing, a continual sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sanctification is the general term, and renewing is a specific term.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the sanctifying we have the renewing every day.</S>
