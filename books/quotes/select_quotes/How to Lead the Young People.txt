Without a heart, a person will not want to do anything, and even if he does something, he will not be enthusiastic in doing it
If you want to do this work, you must like the young people, care for them, and be concerned about their affairs
We can say that virtually everyone used by God to begin a new thing or chosen by God to turn the age was a young man
Twenty years from now those who will be useful to the Lord are those who are in their twenties or younger today
If the Lord does not have a group of young people today to receive help, after some time, when we pass away, will there not be a gap?
If you see this, your heart will be burdened to love the young people regardless of whether they are good or bad
May the brothers and sisters as the Lord's lovers all love the young people for the future of the church and for the Lord's work
It is hard to say that those whom we feel are good now will be good in the future, and those whom we feel are bad today will be bad tomorrow
Regardless of whether the young people are good or bad we need to treat everyone the same and we need to like them and be concerned for them
If you cannot talk to them about the Lord Jesus because He is gone after you play ball, then your spirituality is false
Helping the young brothers and sisters depends not on your ability to give them messages but on your regular, frequent contacts with them
When you contact the young brothers and sisters, do not begin by asking, 'How many chapters of the Bible have you read today?
Because young people have many practical problems, you need to sense their feelings beginning with these problems
We cannot say that to be fallen is right, but please remember that all those who truly know God's salvation were once fallen people
If a person has been preserved since his birth and has never lived in a fallen way, he cannot have a deep experience of God's salvation
Today you may consider a certain young man very bad, but one day he may become very good, contrary to your view
In the same way, today you may think that a certain young man is very good, but some day he may become very bad
All those who have some experience in the young people's work will say, "We don't trust in the young people's condition"
Sometimes it is hard for those who are consistently good to have spiritual perception, and often their growth is slow
All those who have a desire to do the young people's work need to learn how to match and adapt to the young people
We who do the young people's work need to deal with our character to such an extent that we are just like glue
We should work not only to the extent of gaining him but also to gain some people through him in that foreign country
We need to correspond with the brothers and sisters who are studying abroad to continue communication with them
If we are doing a real work, then even if a young person flies to the sky, we will follow him there to adapt to him
If you really know the students' situation, you will know that with the young people, being busy is not a problem
When you gather them together, usually all you can do is give them a message and at most a little work of revival
You can see that even if there are no big meetings, many can still get saved and many can still be raised up to love the Lord
In the same way among so many young brothers and sisters you need to feel and see which ones once they are gained will have impact on others
If you hold big meetings from the outset, there will be only a twenty percent effect, and the other eighty percent will amount to zero
May the Lord be gracious to us that in His work and in the church we will treasure the souls of the young people
