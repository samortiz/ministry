   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS EVERYTHING TO US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians is a precious book which follows the book of Romans in God's sovereign arrangement of the books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans starts with the condemnation of sins and then goes on to justification, identification with Christ, the walk and life in the Spirit, and the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But how can we have the Body life?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the answer, we need 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you want to have the Body life, you have to realize that Christ is everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what 1 Corinthians reveals to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chapter one tells us that we have been called into the fellowship, the participation, the enjoyment, of this wonderful One v. 9 . God has put us into Him v. 30 , and He is the power and wisdom of God v. 24 . Now we are in Christ, enjoying Him as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapter two tells us that if we are going to enjoy Christ, we have to give up our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Otherwise, we will be a soulish person, who always considers the things of Christ to be foolishness v. 14 . We have to be a person in the spirit so that we can enjoy this wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For our past Christ is our righteousness; for our present He is our sanctification; and for our future destiny He is our redemption 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we are going to realize such a Christ, we have to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may use electricity as an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The electricity installed in a building can be applied only by turning on the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, Christ can be applied to us only by the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we will become spiritual persons 2:15; 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A spiritual person is a person living, moving, acting, and having his being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TRANSFORMED INTO PRECIOUS MATERIAL</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FOR GOD'S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians goes on to tell us that something of Christ has been planted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The real ministry of life is like the ministry of Apollos, who watered the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God goes along with this watering and gives the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ has been sown into us, and Christ is going to grow out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Christ grows out of us, this growth transforms us to produce the gold, silver, and precious stones v. 12 . According to our natural being, we are wood, grass, and stubble, but we are being transformed into precious material for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord will not use anything of our natural being for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some of the saints may be good in a natural way without any transformation in their nature or disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our natural goodness has nothing to do with God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We were born as wood, grass, and stubble worthless material for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But we were reborn with gold, and we are being transformed into silver and precious stones by being watered and by our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need the watering for the growth in life that we may be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, 1 Corinthians 3 shows us the planting, watering, growing, transforming, and the producing of precious material for God's building.</S>
