   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 In Their Localities Respectively</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The believers live in churches that are in their localities respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 8:1, for example, speaks of "the church in Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was the first church established in a locality within the jurisdiction of a city, in this case the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was a local church in its locality, as indicated by the Lord in Matthew 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was not the universal church, as revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18, but only a part of the universal church, which is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The record of the New Testament concerning the establishment of the church in its locality is consistent throughout Acts 13:1; 14:23; Rom 16:1; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 8:1; Gal 1:2; Rev 1:4, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second mention of a particular local church in the New Testament is in Acts 13:1a.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse says, "Now there were in Antioch, in the church that was there, prophets and teachers."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Antioch there was another local church, another expression of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, in Acts 8 and 13 we can see one church with two expressions: one is at Jerusalem, the other at Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All local churches are the expression of the one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul addresses "the church of God which is in Corinth."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This reveals that the church is not the church of any person, practice, or doctrine but of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is the church of God because it is constituted of the universal God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a church existed in Corinth, a definite locality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In nature the church is universal in God, but in practice the church is local in a definite place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the church has two aspects: the universal and the local.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the universal aspect, the church has no content; without the local aspect, it is impossible for the church to have any expression and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, the New Testament emphasizes the local aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The description of the church in 1 Corinthians 1:2 is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is of God, for it is constituted of the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the church which is of God is also local.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, in this one verse we see both the universal aspect and the local aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The universal aspect refers to the constitution, nature, and content of the church; the local aspect refers to the expression and practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have only the local aspect but not the aspect of the church being of God, we shall have only an outward formality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We shall be lacking the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we have only the universal aspect but not the local aspect of the church in a particular locality, we shall have the reality but not the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, the church is constituted of God; on the other hand, the church is expressed in a particular locality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The universal church is expressed and practiced in particular localities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The universal church as the Body of Christ is expressed through the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The local churches, as the expressions of the one Body of Christ, are locally one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The book of Revelation was written to local churches, to "the seven churches which are in Asia" 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Asia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire in which were the seven cities mentioned in Revelation 1:11.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The seven churches were in those seven cities respectively, not all in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The book of Revelation does not deal with the one universal church but with the local churches in many cities.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is first revealed as universal in Matthew 16:18 and then as local in Matthew 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Acts the church was practiced in the way of local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Except for a few Epistles written to individuals, all the Epistles in the New Testament were written to local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not one was written to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without the local churches there is no practicality and actuality of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The universal church is realized in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Knowing the church universally must be consummated in knowing the church locally.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a great advance for us to know and practice the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Concerning the church, the book of Revelation is in the advanced stage, for it is written to local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Revelation 1:11 the voice said to John, "What you see write in a book and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This verse is composed in a very important way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this verse we see that the sending of this book to the seven churches equals the sending of it to the seven cities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This shows clearly that the practice of the church life in the early days was that of one church for one city, one city with one church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In no city was there more than one church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the local church, local with respect to city, not with respect to street or area.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The jurisdiction of a local church should cover the whole city in which the church is; it should not be greater or lesser than the boundary of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the believers within that boundary should constitute the one unique local church within that city.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, one church equals one city, and one city equals one church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is what we call the local churches.</S>
