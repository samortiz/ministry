   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN A LOCAL CHURCH 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:1, 3-11, 13, 18, 24, 28; 14:4, 5, 12, 25</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall begin to consider 1 Corinthians 12.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a difficult chapter to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Over the years I have spent a great deal of time on this chapter, but I do not yet have a thorough understanding of it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 12:1 Paul says, Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 12:1 14:40 Paul deals with the problem of spiritual gifts in relation to God s administration and operation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>SPEAKING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 12:3 Paul says, Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The apostle s thought here is that the dumb, voiceless idols in verse 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of speaking is related to the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, Jesus is accursed ; he would like to say, and he is able to say, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Worshippers of God should not be silent; rather, they should speak forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This to speak the Lord Jesus is the main function of all the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 3 Paul tells us that no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that when we say with a proper spirit, Jesus is Lord, we are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, to call on the Lord Jesus is the way to participate in, enjoy, and experience the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 12:2 Paul tells the Corinthians, You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The worshippers in an idol temple do not speak; rather, they are silent, or dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are voiceless worshippers, seeming not to have a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One important difference between those who worship idols and those who worship the living God is this: idol worshippers are silent, but those who worship the living God speak of the Lord in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Throughout the centuries, many Christians have been influenced by the silent worship of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the result of this influence, the majority of those who enter into so-called places of worship are silent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Usually, they hire a pastor to do the speaking for them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The congregation remains silent, or dumb, and the speaking is done by the hired ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the actual situation among many believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The situation was very different in the days of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the time of the apostles, when Christians came together, they made noise by speaking in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They did not worship God in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the psalmist said, they made a joyful noise to the Lord Psa 95:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, Paul s thought in 1 Corinthians 12, a chapter concerned with the function of the members in the church meeting, is that we all should speak in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>SPEAKING AND THE EXERCISE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Speaking in the Holy Spirit is a matter related to spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Christians today talk about spiritual gifts, they usually have in mind the gifts of speaking in tongues, healing, and miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, in this chapter Paul indicates that the spiritual gifts are mainly related to speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul lists nine gifts, and of these nine five involve speaking: the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, prophesying, tongue-speaking, and the interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The other four gifts listed by Paul are faith, healings, works of power, and the discerning of spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These four gifts are related to activity, not to speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the New Testament understanding, a church meeting in which the spiritual gifts are exercised is a meeting in which there is much speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose we come together for a meeting, and we all are silent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In such a meeting, there would not be any exercise of spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order for the gifts to be exercised in a meeting of the church, we need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can testify that when I speak, I exercise my gift.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, to exercise our gift means that we are exercised in speaking.</S>
