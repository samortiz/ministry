   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE SIXTY-NINE CHRIST HIS WORK 7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall complete our study of Christ's work in His earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>15.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Cleansing the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus cleansed the temple twice, at the beginning of His earthly ministry and at the end. John 2:14 through 16 says that He "found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And having made a whip of cords, He drove them all, both the sheep and the oxen, out of the temple, and He poured out the coins of the moneychangers and overturned the tables; and to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away; do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here the Lord Jesus dealt with the house of God by cleansing it with a whip, or a scourge, made of cords.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 17 says, "His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of Your house shall devour Me."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Within the Lord Jesus was a zeal for the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This zeal devoured Him, ate Him up, consumed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was absolutely for God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When He saw the corrupted situation in the temple, He could not tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because His heart was pure for the Father, He could not bear to see that the temple, His Father's house, was defiled, contaminated by the things of man's greed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, driven by zeal for His Father's house, He cleansed it, driving the defilement out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ's cleansing of the temple the second time is recorded in Matthew 21:12 and 13.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After He entered the city of Jerusalem, the first thing He did was to cleanse the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Any earthly king, upon entering the capital, would immediately have ascended to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Lord Jesus did not do this, because He was not for His own interests but for God's interests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His heart was not for His kingdom but for God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>16.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Living the Father</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said that He lived because of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ lived on earth not merely by the Father or through the Father but because of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His living had a cause, and that cause was the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the Father was not simply an instrument through which or by which the Son lived; rather, the Father was the cause of the Son's living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today Christ should be the cause of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should live not only by Him and through Him but also because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He should be the cause of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, our living will be meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without the Father as His cause, the Son's living on earth for thirty-three and a half years would have been vain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But His living was not vain, because the Son's living had the Father as the cause.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>17.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Working with the Father</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In John 5 the Lord Jesus did the work of enlivening an impotent man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The religious Jews persecuted Him because He enlivened the impotent man on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working" 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In their religious concept they were resting and keeping their Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They did not know that there was no rest for the Father and the Son as long as the poor sinners were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While the religious Jews were resting in keeping their Sabbath, the Father and the Son were working so that sinners might receive life and have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although God's work in creation was finished Gen 2:1-3 , in Christ's earthly ministry the Father and the Son were still working for redemption and building John 5:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This work includes the Son's life-giving, which is manifested in John 5.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this matter the Father and the Son are one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever the Father wants to do in the matter of life-giving, the Son does accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus never did any work without the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He always worked with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This required the absolute denial of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ denied Himself in order to work with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As the Lord Jesus worked with the Father, He worked in the name of the Father John 10:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Having come in the Father's name John 5:43 , He never did anything in His own name; He did everything in the Father's name.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For Him to work in the name of the Father means that He worked as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus and the Father were not working separately.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the contrary, the Lord was working with the Father as one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Christ worked with the Father, He worked not with the Father who was merely in heaven, but with the Father who was with Him and in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This truth concerning Christ's working with the Father is contrary to the traditional teaching which says that when the Son was on earth, the Father was merely in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Economically, the Son was on earth and the Father was in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Essentially, however, while the Son was working on earth, the Father was living in Him and working with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Essentially, the Father and the Son are one John 10:30 ; They cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, Christ worked with the Father in the way of being one with Him.</S>
