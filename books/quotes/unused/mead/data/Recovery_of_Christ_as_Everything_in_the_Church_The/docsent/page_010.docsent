   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT CONTAINING THE KILLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DEATH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Christ s resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before His resurrection, such a Spirit was not yet John 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The life-giving Spirit is the Spirit who gives life 2 Cor 3:6, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now the Spirit of God has been compounded, as typified by the compounding of the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:22-33.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the tabernacle was built, God commanded that a hin of pure olive oil, typifying the Spirit of God, be compounded with four spices myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These spices signify, respectively, Christ s death, the sweetness of His death, His resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This type was fulfilled when the Spirit of God was compounded with Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, and His death and resurrection were compounded into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ingredients such as tea, milk, lemon, and honey may be added to a glass of water.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we take in such a drink, we receive not only the water but also all the other ingredients along with their benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, when we drink the Spirit today, we receive not only the Spirit but also the death and the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These elements have been mingled into the compound Spirit, who is the life-giving Spirit, the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today the Spirit who indwells our spirit is a killing One because He has been compounded with the death of Christ and its effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is killing in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we call, O Lord Jesus, we experience killing from within.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Immediately after calling on the Lord, we may sense that we have been wrong in our conduct or attitude toward our husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The life-giving Spirit is also the germ-killing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are wrong, rather than hearing an admonishing or rebuking word from someone, we simply need to call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more we call, the more the negative elements within us are killed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A medical doctor who knows that his patient is sick from certain germs will be at peace once he has given his patient the right antibiotic.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The doctor knows that when the antibiotic has been taken, the germs will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same way, as long as I minister the crucified Christ into the saints, I am fully at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My ministry may be likened to a medical treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the last message in a conference is given, I am at peace because I have the full assurance that I have passed on the necessary antibiotic Christ crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is not much recorded of the Lord s first thirty years on the earth, but we have the full record of His last three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In those three and a half years He constantly walked, lived, moved, and worked under death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first step was baptism; the last step was the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was crucified to live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Christ had not died, He could not have resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Death being the threshold of resurrection is a great principle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ s death ushered Him into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His dying to be resurrected was His dying to live.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without death He could not have resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Death brings in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we too need to die to live.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have a dying Christ within us, and this dying Christ is the ingredients of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The life-giving Spirit is constituted with the death of Christ and the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not need to make ourselves die, because we have a dying One within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not need to kill our own germs, because we have the antibiotics to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the crucified Christ as the way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST BEING A NEW AND LIVING WAY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The crucified Christ being the way is further revealed in Hebrews 10:19-20, which says, Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A new and living way has been opened by Christ s death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was crucified to rend the veil that separates man from God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The way has been opened by Christ s crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the crucified Christ is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To take Christ as our way in everything, we need to die with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to shepherd the saints or be a good elder, brother, sister, husband, wife, father, or mother, we do not need to learn certain steps.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The way is simply to die with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The way of the Christian life is the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ crucified is the way of my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I die with Him, I have much to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have learned this secret.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever I need to speak, I go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then I receive a word from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A word from the crucified Christ is a word in resurrection, and a word in resurrection is boundless.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we have merely learned something of dead letters, after we speak it, that is the end of it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if we go to the cross and are willing to die there, our speaking will be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ crucified is the way of our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Before a recent turmoil among the local churches, I saw signs of rebellion and signs that the churches were deviating from the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At that time I went to the Lord, and the Lord told me not to do anything outwardly or make an issue of anything but to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By the Lord s mercy and grace I went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>By going to the cross, a living word came.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many messages came by my going to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now I would never leave the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many things have tempted me to leave the cross, but by the Lord s mercy I have been preserved on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more I remain on the cross, the more the messages come.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The crucified Christ is the way to carry out the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In our daily Christian walk the crucified Christ is the prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:10-12, Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>So then death operates in us, but life in you.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The putting to death of Jesus is the way of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we are identified with the crucified Christ, He becomes our way our way to live the Christian life, to worship God, to enter into God s presence, to take care of the church, to shepherd the saints, to preach the gospel, and to be a proper husband, wife, son, or daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The crucified Christ is the way to do everything in the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Christ who said that He is the way John 14:6 constantly lived under death throughout the three and a half years of His earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From the first step of His baptism to the last step of the cross, Christ was crucified all the way to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is as such a crucified One that He is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The way for us to live the Christian life today is to die with Christ.</S>
