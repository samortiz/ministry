<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee during periods of informal training in the spring of 1969 and 1970 in Los Angeles, California.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ON THE POSITION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>We must realize that we Christians are a meeting people. A Christian is a meeting person. Without meeting, there is no Christian life and no church life. It is rather difficult for any Christian to grow without attending the meetings. There is no way for any Christian to serve God without meetings, and it is impossible for Christians to express Christ if there are no meetings. The church life is a meeting life. When we read the first chapters of the book of Acts, we see that in the early days, in the first local church, the Church in Jerusalem, the saints were meeting daily. Every day they met together; so they were a sound and strong church. It was not like the situation of today&rsquo;s Christianity with little more than an eleven o&rsquo;clock meeting on Sunday morning. We must meet all the time if possible. Hebrews 10:25 tells us that we must build up a habit and not lose that habit. We should not cease to meet together &ldquo;as the habit of some is.&rdquo; That is a wrong kind of habit. We should not build up a habit of not meeting, but a habit of meeting all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF LISTENING TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The tremendous importance of the meetings is exceedingly clear to us. I do not believe we need to stress this further. But <em>how to meet</em>&mdash;this is the real problem. If we were to go to all the Christian leaders, the Bible teachers, and even the most spiritual people and ask them, &ldquo;What is the right way for Christians to meet?&rdquo; I do not believe there is a person or ever has been a person on this earth who could tell us.</p>
<p>In the entire New Testament the first place that mentions something regarding the meetings of believers is Matthew 18. The Lord Jesus told us in Matthew 18:20 that where two or three are gathered together in His name, He will be in their midst. This is the unique instance of the Lord Jesus speaking something concerning Christian meetings. In all the past years Christians have been using this verse very much in regard to the matter of meeting. But whenever this verse is used, just one thing, howbeit the main thing, is pointed out&mdash;that is, the matter of meeting in the Lord&rsquo;s name. No doubt the matter of the name in this verse is an important point. We will see in a coming chapter what it really means to meet in the Lord&rsquo;s name&mdash;this is most significant. But at the present time we want to consider the context of this verse. In what kind of situation did the Lord speak the words recorded in Matthew 18:20? In other words, what is the background of this verse? To discover this we must look into the context, starting from verse 15. If you read carefully, from verse 15 through verse 20, you will see why and how the Lord spoke the word in verse 20. Let us look into these verses.</p>
<p>The Lord said in verse 15 that if a brother offend you, you must go to him and do whatever you can to recover him. If he will not listen to you, then you must bring with you one or two others to convince him&mdash;perhaps by two or three the brother will be gained. But suppose he will not listen to these two or three; then you must bring the case to the church (v. 17). We know that this must be the local church. It must be the church on this earth, the church in a place, the church in the locality where you are. And it must be there at the time when you are there. Surely this is not a church in the heavens nor a church in the coming age&mdash;how could you go <em>there</em> to tell the church? It must be the church where you can go and bring your case in a practical way. You may say that the church in Matthew 16 is the universal church, but the church mentioned in chapter eighteen is undoubtedly the local church, the church in the place where you live. Suppose then that this offending brother neglects to listen to the church. What is the result? I tell you, it is not a small thing, for he will be considered by the church a heathen man and a publican.</p>
<p>Here we must pause to see a tremendously important matter. Brothers and sisters, have you seen the seriousness of this verse? This verse tells us that we need the church, and we need to be in the church. If we neglect to hear the church, we become a heathen. I may consider myself so spiritual, so heavenly, but if I neglect to hear the church, in the eyes of God I simply become a heathen man. It is quite serious. Look at today&rsquo;s situation. Thousands of Christians are here and there, but who are really in the church? Before you came to the local church, you were Christians. In a sense you loved the Lord, and in another sense you even sought the Lord, but at that time you were not in the church; you missed the church. In another sense, to some extent, you did neglect to hear the church, and in another more serious sense you may have criticized the local church and rebelled against it. Yet you still considered yourself spiritual. We all must see that in the eyes of the Lord, if we neglect to listen to the church, we become just as the heathen. What is a heathen man? A heathen man is a man of this world, a man on this earth who is not built into the church. God has chosen us, His people, to be in the church. God has no intention of choosing a myriad of individuals. His intention is to choose a people, a collective people, a corporate people as the Body of Christ, the church. If you are not built into the church, you may be a part of the church in nature, but in position you are still as a heathen. Because you have been born again, because you have the life of God within you, because you have a divine and heavenly nature, you are a part of the church in nature, but in position you are outside of the church. Regardless of whether you have the heavenly nature or not, in position you are still the same as a heathen. This is an exceedingly serious matter. It is a serious thing not to be in the church; it is also a serious thing to miss the church; and it is even more serious to neglect to listen to the church.</p>
<p>Some dear saints who would not listen to the church, who considered that they were better than the church, that they were right and the church was wrong, eventually became miserable, not only spiritually but even physically. It is not a small matter. This is not something of an organization or anything under someone&rsquo;s control. Who could control such a thing? No one. This is something of the sovereignty of the Lord. When the church says &ldquo;no,&rdquo; you must also say &ldquo;no.&rdquo; When the church says that you must go along, then you must go along. For the past thirty years, not only here in America, but also on the mainland of China and in Taiwan (Formosa), I have been watching and observing. Without exception, I have seen the same thing. In all these years, those who have criticized and rebelled against the church have ended in a miserable condition. But the Lord Jesus did not speak in this passage of rebelling against the church, He only spoke of neglecting to hear the church. That alone is sufficient for a person to be considered as a heathen and a publican. Regardless of how spiritual you consider yourself, as long as you neglect to hear the church, in the eyes of God you are just as a heathen.</p><h2 class="head1">EXECUTING THE DECISION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Then immediately following, in verse 18, the Lord Jesus said something about the exercise of the authority of the church. He said, &ldquo;Whatsoever ye [that means the church] bind, the heavens will bind, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, the heavens will loose.&rdquo; This is the authority the Lord gave to Peter in chapter sixteen. The Roman Catholic Church says that this authority was given only to Peter; so today only &ldquo;the successor of Peter,&rdquo; the Pope, has it. But they neglect to see that in chapter eighteen the same authority has been given to the church, to the whole church. The church has the authority to bind. To bind whom? To bind the one who neglects to hear the church. Read the context again and you will see that this is the meaning. The church has the authority to bind him who neglects to hear the church.</p>
<p>How could this decision be carried out? By what way could the church execute this decision? By verses 19 and 20, that is, by the saints meeting together to pray concerning this matter. Read the context and you will see that this is the meaning. You see the Lord said something regarding the meeting, because to exercise the authority of the church, to bind the dissenting one is not an individual matter, but a matter of the church, the corporate Body. The Body must execute the decision. By what way? By the way of prayer. The saints must come together to pray that the church may execute what the church decides. By this we see that the meetings of the believers must be something belonging to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MISAPPLICATION OF MATTHEW 18:20</h2>
<p>People today pluck out verse 20 and say, &ldquo;Look, the Lord Jesus said that where two or three are meeting together in His name, there He will be in their midst.&rdquo; They use this verse to justify any meeting where two or three are gathered in His name. But they simply neglect the context of this verse. The context tells us that the meetings of the believers must be something of the church, must be something which take the stand of the church. They should not be isolated from the church; they should be connected and belonging to the church. Today Christians misapply verse 20. They take verse 20 as a ground for their meeting, but they never stand with the church. They do not have the church standing; they just meet by themselves without the church. They have the meeting, but they do not have the church; their meeting has no ground of the church, and their meeting is not taking the stand with the church.</p>
<p>How then should we meet? Firstly, if we would meet properly, our meeting must be related to the church, and our meeting must belong to the church. Our meeting must be standing with the church and be a part of the church. The purpose of our meeting must be to execute the decision of the church.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very sorry for the situation of today&rsquo;s Christianity. All the free groups take Matthew 18:20 as the justification, the basis for their meeting. If you inquire of them regarding the church, they answer that they do not understand anything concerning the church; they say that they just meet together upon the scriptural ground of Matthew 18:20. I can assure you that this is true not only in the western world, but also in the Far East. So many Christians are meeting together, but they simply do not know that when they meet together they need the standing of the church. The meeting of believers, the meeting of Christians, must be a part of the church, must take the stand of the church, and must be for the purpose of executing the church&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are some who are reading this book who still have such a concept. They feel that as long as they meet in the name of the Lord Jesus, that is sufficient. But according to the context of Matthew 18:20, that is not sufficient. You must have the church. If your meeting is taking the stand with the church, if your meeting is part of the church and belongs to the church, if your meeting is for the execution of the church&rsquo;s decision, that is sufficient. If it is not, your meeting is wrong. That is not a proper meeting; that is a divisive meeting. That is not the meeting of the church; that is a meeting of division. I say again, the proper meeting of believers must be a part of the church, must stand with the church, and must execute the church&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>To take a verse out of context is exceedingly dangerous and utterly wrong. We should not cut verse 20 out of this chapter; we must care for the context. I know a number of brothers whose first name is John, but if I care only for the first name without bothering about the last, I will find myself in a mess. I must not cut off the first name from the last. Likewise, if I cut off verse 20 from verses 15 through 19, I will miss the point and intention of the passage. We need verses 15 through 19 to substantiate us in the proper use of verse 20. According to the context, the Christian meeting is something which is absolutely related to the church, the local church.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that six or seven brothers feel unhappy with the local church. For whatever reason they may have to be unhappy, they begin a meeting in one of their homes, declaring and even claiming Matthew 18:20 as their scriptural ground. They can say to others, &ldquo;It is perfectly all right for us to meet in this way; we are more than two or three, and we are meeting in the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; But if they spoke in this way to me, I would ask them, &ldquo;Brothers, do you consider your meeting a part of the local church in the city where you live? Is your meeting taking the stand of the church? Is your meeting executing what the church has decided to do?&rdquo; If those brothers would not listen to the church in that place, they become divisive. They must go back. They need the assurance that their meeting is just a part of the local church. It is so clear.</p>
<p>Suppose that you and others in the city where you live are fed up with Christianity; so you start to meet together separately in the Lord&rsquo;s name. You say, &ldquo;We give up Christianity; we&rsquo;ve had enough of the old system of religion; now we are just meeting by ourselves in the name of the Lord Jesus, assured according to Matthew 18:20 that we have His presence.&rdquo; We would simply ask you, Is your meeting taking the stand with the true local church in your city? Or is your meeting some isolated thing, something without the church as a standing? If so, your meeting is divisive and not a proper meeting. Do not isolate Matthew 18:20&mdash;it must be understood by the context. Read the context, and you will see the right meaning of meeting in the name of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">ACTUAL AND PRACTICAL EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>Now let us go from Matthew to the book of Acts. We are told in Acts 2, in the early days of the church that the believers in Jerusalem met in houses. They broke bread from house to house (v. 46). Why? Because they had such a large number. In one day they suddenly had an increase of three thousand (2:41), and in another day five thousand (4:4), making a total of over eight thousand believers. It was really difficult for them all to come together in one place. Obviously, it was more convenient for them to meet in their homes. But we must realize that all these home meetings were part of the one church at Jerusalem. What they were doing in their meetings was simply carrying out what the church in Jerusalem intended and decided. They were not isolated from the church; they were not meeting without the church in the locality as their background and standing. This actual and practical situation exactly fits the Lord&rsquo;s words in Matthew 18. Here and there, in this house and in so many other houses, they were members of that one church, not meeting isolatedly, not meeting separately from the church, but meeting in full relationship with the local church in Jerusalem. All these home meetings were not independent meetings; they were meetings of that one local church. They met in their homes for the Lord&rsquo;s table (2:46), for preaching the gospel (5:42), and for praying (12:12). When Peter was released from prison, he went to Mary&rsquo;s house, where many were gathered together praying. That meeting was not the church, but that meeting was a part of the church in Jerusalem. That meeting stood with the church in Jerusalem, and that meeting where the saints were praying was carrying out the decision of that church. It was not an isolated meeting. This is the proper way to meet.</p>
<p>Acts 8:1 tells us that though there were so many meetings in Jerusalem, yet there was but one church, the church at Jerusalem. Then in chapter twenty-one of Acts we see something more. Verse 20 of that chapter says that the number of believers in Jerusalem by that time was in the tens of thousands. (The word <em>thousands</em> in the King James Version should be translated <em>myriads</em> or <em>tens of thousands.</em>) There were not only eight, nine, or ten thousand, but tens of thousands. We do not know how many, but have you noticed, in verse 18 of that same chapter, that there was only one eldership there? This verse tells us that James was one of the elders and that all the elders were present. In all Jerusalem with so many tens of thousands of believers, there was but one church with one eldership. There were myriads of brothers and sisters with many home meetings, yet one church and one eldership.</p>
<p>I received a letter recently from a saint who asked how there could possibly be only one church in a very large city with many saints. I also saw a letter written by a famous preacher who wrote that he would not agree with this matter of one eldership in one city. Brothers and sisters, we do not care what people say; we just care what the Bible says. Have you noted all these verses from the book of Acts? There were myriads of believers and they were meeting in many houses in Jerusalem, but they were still under one group of elders. If you read the book of Acts, you will see that whatever decision was made by this one group of elders was taken by all the believers, because they were all one church. Acts 8:1 says, &ldquo;the church at Jerusalem.&rdquo; Why do I stress this matter so much? Because it is so basic to the matter of meeting. The first thing we must care for in the matter of meeting is that our meeting must be a part of the local church. We must meet by taking the stand of the church and by carrying out what the church intends to do. We may have scores of home meetings. I would like to see in the city of Los Angeles more than one hundred home meetings, yet all one church under one eldership.</p>
<p>In the city of Taipei, on the Island of Taiwan, there is an actual example of this at the present time. In that city there is one church, the church at Taipei, with thousands of believers and more than sixty home meetings, yet all under one eldership. All those home meetings are not isolated and independent meetings; they are in full relationship one to another and to the one church there. The first thing we must care for in regard to our meetings is that we meet in this way. By being related to the local church, we are right. This is a basic matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WHOLE CHURCH MEETING TOGETHER</h2>
<p>From the book of Acts we go on now to 1 Corinthians. If the church has a very large number of believers, it is rather difficult, of course, for the whole church to come together. In that case we need more than one meeting place. But 1 Corinthians 14:23 says, &ldquo;If therefore the whole church be come together into one place....&rdquo; In some places the number of brothers and sisters in the church may not be so large. They may have a place where the whole church can come together. Then this kind of meeting, a meeting of the whole church, <em>is</em> the church. Why? Because in verse 23 it says that &ldquo;the whole church be come together,&rdquo; and in verse 33 it says, &ldquo;as in all churches.&rdquo; When the whole church comes together, that is the meeting and that is also the church&mdash;the meeting is the church. That meeting is not only part of the church; that meeting is the church. Brothers and sisters, the proper way to meet is to meet either as a part of the church or as the church; otherwise, our meetings are wrong. The matter of meeting must be absolutely related to the church. If the whole church comes together, then we meet as the church. If it is not possible for the entire church to come together, we must meet in different places, but all the different meetings are just parts of that one church. All the meetings in one city should be constituents of the unique local church in that city. This is the proper way to meet. If our meeting is not definitely and positively related to the church, we are not qualified to meet and we are not in a proper position to meet; we are wrong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>This matter has very much to do with the oneness of the Body. If a few brothers meet here and there in the Lord&rsquo;s name without caring for the church, the Body of Christ is divided. We must all meet with a proper and positive relationship to the local church. Then our meeting will not be a divisive meeting; it will be a meeting that stands with the church and executes the church&rsquo;s will. We cannot begin any meeting carelessly. We cannot start any meeting without taking care of the church. Whenever we begin to meet, we must meet for the church: either we meet as the church or as a part of the church. That means that we are absolutely one with the church and that there can be no divisions. It is in this way that our meetings will be kept in the church in oneness. The Lord be merciful to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BY BEING CHURCH CONSCIOUS</h1>
<p>We have seen that in the church in Jerusalem there were tens of thousands of believers meeting in many houses, yet they were still under one group of elders, they were still called the church at Jerusalem. They may have had hundreds of meetings, but all these many meetings were still one church. A good illustration of this today is the Bank of America. In the city of Los Angeles it has numerous branches, but still it is only one bank. Every branch executes the administration of one bank. If this kind of arrangement and administration could be executed by a bank, why could it not be done by the church? The church is greater and better than the Bank of America. We must pray regarding this matter. &ldquo;Lord, build up such a church here in Los Angeles with tens of thousands of believers and with many meetings to show the enemy, to show Thy people, that it is absolutely possible for the Lord to do this today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have seen also from 1 Corinthians 14 that the church and the meeting, the meeting and the church, are identified one with the other. The church equals the meeting, and the meeting equals the church. &ldquo;In all churches of the saints&rdquo; (14:33) means in all meetings of the saints in various localities. The meeting in this city is just the church in this city. The meeting in San Francisco is just the church there in San Francisco. This proves that the Christian meeting must be church related. The Christian meeting must be of the church, for the church, and eventually must be the church. Therefore, the first principle we must learn and apply is that the meeting of Christians must be related to the church. Either it is the church, or it is part of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIN OF CHURCHLESS MEETINGS</h2>
<p>There are so many Christian meetings today which are simply churchless. Those who attend them have no concept whatever of the church; so their meetings are not church related or church conscious. We all must be so church conscious in our meetings. Strictly speaking, if we know the Word of the Lord, we will realize that to meet in a churchless way is actually sin. Why? Because if we meet without paying due attention to the church, we are meeting in a divisive way. To be divisive in the eyes of God is sinful, for God&rsquo;s intention is to have a church. God&rsquo;s purpose is to build up a Body for His Son. If we meet in a divisive way, if we meet without keeping the oneness of the church, we are damaging the Body of Christ by our meetings, we are frustrating the building up of the church. So many people are innocently sinful; yet still they are sinful, because they are dividing and damaging the Body of Christ. Some are doing it consciously. This is not a small thing.</p>
<p>Before I saw this, about forty years ago, I was quite free to meet with Christians. But since the Lord has revealed this matter to me, I have never been careless in this matter. The Lord has made me to realize that Christian meetings are so greatly related to the church. If we meet in a proper and normal way, we build up the church; if not, we damage the church. Though we may have a good intention in our coming together, if we are not meeting church consciously, we are sinful and against the Lord&rsquo;s economy. We all must be exceedingly clear that whenever we meet, whenever we even consider coming together, we must be church conscious; we must never meet with any Christians in a churchless way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH CONSCIOUSNESS<br />
OF THE EARLY CHRISTIANS</h2>
<p>Now in order to strengthen this concept, this matter in God&rsquo;s revelation, I wish to point out to you many verses in the book of Acts regarding the church. If you read through all these verses, you will realize that in the early days, in the first century, all the Christians were so church conscious, so church related. In their concept there was nothing of individualism. Whatever they had was the church&mdash;it was all the time the church. By reading these verses in the divine record, we see how careful the Holy Spirit was in using the word. Time after time, if I were the writer, I would use the word &ldquo;believers&rdquo;; but the Holy Spirit continually uses the word &ldquo;the church.&rdquo; This is the record of fact in the ancient days. As far as the early saints were concerned, it was always a matter of the church. Whatever they did, they did it church consciously; whenever they met, they met for the church. In the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s record regarding those days, this word &ldquo;the church&rdquo; is used over and over. Based upon this fact, we have the principle that we must always be church conscious.</p>
<p>Now let us look into these verses. In the first four chapters of the book of Acts, the term &ldquo;church&rdquo; has not been used. In the last verse of chapter two, in the King James Version, we have the word &ldquo;church.&rdquo; But better manuscripts show that there is not such a term in chapter two. It is not till chapter five, verse 11, that this term &ldquo;the church&rdquo; is used. In Acts 2:44, however, we do have this clause: &ldquo;All that believed were together.&rdquo; This, of course, was their meeting. And so you can see that the believers at that time were meeting people. They were the people who came together all the time, and this was their meeting.</p>
<p>Then chapter four, verse 23, proves something more. After John and Peter were released from prison, the Bible says that they went to their own company. The King James Version uses the word &ldquo;company,&rdquo; but in Greek we do not have this word. The literal rendering of the Greek is, &ldquo;they went to their own.&rdquo; This means that they went to their own people. Then in verse 31, we see that this was a meeting. It says, &ldquo;The place... where they were assembled together.&rdquo; This also strongly proves that in the early days the Christians were so accustomed to meet together. Immediately after Peter and John were released from prison, they went to their own, and it was to a meeting. Do you think that they called a special meeting? I do not think so. Immediately after they came out from prison, they went to their own, and there was a meeting going on. The same thing occurred when Peter was released from prison in Acts chapter twelve. He came to the house of Mary, and when he arrived, there were many in that house praying; a meeting was in progress (v. 12). In the early days the Christians were not separated ones, but gathered ones. They were a gathering people: all the time they were coming together. We Christians must be such a people.</p>
<p>Then in chapter five something of a negative nature occurred. Ananias and his wife Sapphira cheated the Holy Spirit and they died. Then what does the Holy Spirit say? Look into the context. You must realize that what happened there was in the setting of a meeting. The Bible does not clearly say that it was a meeting, but if you read the context, you will see that what occurred must have been in a meeting. Immediately after Ananias expired, some young men were there, and they carried him out and buried him. Then his wife Sapphira came, and she also died; whereupon the young men carried her out. The context indicates a meeting. Eventually, in verse 11 the Bible says, &ldquo;great fear came upon all the church.&rdquo; I have said already that if I were the writer, I would use the word &ldquo;believers&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;great fear came upon all the believers.&rdquo; But the Holy Spirit says, &ldquo;all the church.&rdquo; I do believe that what is meant by &ldquo;the church&rdquo; mostly means the meeting, because you have the last phrase in that verse, &ldquo;as many as heard these things.&rdquo; This proves that the Christian meeting must be something of the church; it must even be the church. The meeting is <em>for</em> the church, the meeting is <em>about</em> the church, and the meeting <em>is</em> the church. I like this word, &ldquo;great fear came upon all <em>the church.</em>&rdquo; I do believe that if you were the writer, you also would use the word &ldquo;believers,&rdquo; not &ldquo;church.&rdquo; Why? Because, sorry to say, we are not so church conscious; we are not so church related. In the early days it was different, and, of course, especially with the Holy Spirit, it is absolutely different. When the Holy Spirit inspired the book of Acts, He used the word &ldquo;church&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;great fear came upon all the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in chapter eight, verse 1, we read, &ldquo;And at that time there was a great persecution against the church.&rdquo; It did not say a great persecution against &ldquo;the Christians&rdquo; or against &ldquo;the believers.&rdquo; No, the persecution was against &ldquo;the church.&rdquo; I tell you, they were really church conscious. Then look at verse 3. It says, &ldquo;Saul made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and hailing men and women committed them to prison.&rdquo; &ldquo;Every house&rdquo; was composed of &ldquo;men and women,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the church&rdquo; was composed of &ldquo;every house.&rdquo; You see, Saul damaged the church by entering into the houses and committing the men and women to prison. Have you noticed this verse and the word &ldquo;church&rdquo; in it? If I were the writer, I would say, &ldquo;Saul made havoc of the believers.&rdquo; But the Holy Spirit says, &ldquo;of the church.&rdquo; In the ancient time all the believers were church conscious. They did not consider themselves as individual believers, but as the corporate church. When they were persecuted, that meant the church was persecuted. They were not the individuals, but the church. They were not separate believers with isolated meetings; they were the church. We today are so greatly under the influence of degraded Christianity. We do need to abandon all our background that we may be so impressed with the church, that we may become church conscious.</p>
<p>Now notice chapter nine, verse 31. It says, &ldquo;Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria...&rdquo; Again the Holy Spirit, contrary to our inclination, uses the word &ldquo;the churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in chapter eleven, verse 22, we have a very special verse: &ldquo;Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was at Jerusalem.&rdquo; I was a Christian for years before I came to see this verse and be impressed with it so clearly and deeply. The church has ears: &ldquo;the tidings came unto the <em>ears of the church.</em>&rdquo; This is really extraordinary. Again I say, if I were the author, I would certainly have written that tidings came to the ears of the believers at Jerusalem. But in the early days the believers considered that their ears were the ears of the church. They did not care so much for themselves as individual believers, but only for the church as a corporate body. Whenever they met, they met in the church way, they met representing the church, they met for the church and as the church. Whatever they heard, they considered it was for the church, because they looked upon their ears as the ears of the church.</p>
<p>Then in verse 26 of the same chapter we read that Barnabas found Saul and brought him to Antioch. And the Word says that for &ldquo;a whole year they assembled themselves with the church.&rdquo; I would have said, &ldquo;with the believers.&rdquo; We are so accustomed to using the word &ldquo;believers.&rdquo; We are believer conscious; we are not church conscious. This verse again proves to us that the Christian assembly must be something of the church. When they assembled themselves, that of course was with the church. And our meeting must be the same.</p>
<p>We stress this matter again and again simply because people today are not church conscious; they do not care for the church. They care for meetings, they care for Christian individuals, but not for the church. Ask yourself this question: You have been meeting with God&rsquo;s children year after year; you have attended meeting after meeting; have you ever had some kind of consciousness that your meeting should be for the church? You have sought to have good meetings, but have you been church related and church conscious?</p>
<p>Then we come to chapter twelve. Chapter twelve, verse 1, says, &ldquo;Now about that time Herod the King stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.&rdquo; It does not say, &ldquo;certain believers,&rdquo; &ldquo;certain apostles,&rdquo; or &ldquo;certain disciples.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit says, &ldquo;certain of the church.&rdquo; In the following verses we see that those whom Herod persecuted were the apostles. In the eyes of God, the apostles were part of the church. Then verse 5 tells us that Peter was put into prison, but the church prayed. The Bible does not say &ldquo;all the believers prayed,&rdquo; but &ldquo;prayer was made of the church.&rdquo; How did the church pray? The church prayed by the believers meeting in homes. Many were meeting in the home of Mary, and undoubtedly many others were meeting in other homes. In verse 12 Peter considered to what house he should go. Eventually he decided to go to the house of Mary the mother of Mark. There were many houses with many believers meeting, but Peter decided to go to this house. All the meetings were just for the church and executed what the church intended to do. It was the move of the whole church to pray for Peter. We need to be so impressed with this matter. Either we should drop our meetings or we should meet in a church way. If we meet in a churchless way, we are sinful in the eyes of God, for we are dividing the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Now look at chapter thirteen. In verse 1 we see that in Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers. Where were they? Of course, in the church. But look at the many Christian workers of today. Where are they? You must allow me to say this: nearly all of them are in a pitiful condition as far as the genuine local church is concerned. Some of them even boast that they have nothing to do with any church and that they are independent. But as one in the Lord&rsquo;s work, if you are not definitely and positively related to a genuine local church, that is a sin. The contrast between the present situation and the early days, when all the prophets and teachers were in a local church, is striking. The prophets and teachers were all part of the church in a practical way and were in the church. To boast that you are independent and not related to any church is not a glory, but a shame. We must be church conscious and church related, not only in our meetings, but also in our Christian work, our Christian ministry, and our Christian service. We should be prophets and teachers in the church, not in a general way, but in a local way, just as they were in &ldquo;the church that was at Antioch.&rdquo; We must be in the genuine local church in the locality where we are.</p>
<p>In chapter fourteen, verse 23, we see that Paul the Apostle and his co-workers established and ordained elders in every church. This proves that where there were believers, there was a church. If in this city there are some believers, these believers must constitute the one church in this city. In the eyes of the apostles they were the church; so the apostles ordained elders in every church. Then in verse 27, we see that when the apostles returned to Antioch, they gathered, not all the saints, not all the Christians, but the church. Have you seen this? This is the book of Acts. They gathered the whole church. The Holy Spirit used the word &ldquo;church,&rdquo; not &ldquo;believers&rdquo; or &ldquo;saints.&rdquo; We must realize that the word in Greek for church means congregation or assembly. It really means the called-out ones gathered together. So the church in its essential meaning is a meeting. When we gather the saints together, that means that we gather the church together.</p>
<p>Now look at chapter fifteen, verses 3 and 4. Verse 3 says that the apostles were brought on their way by the church. That means that the church sent them. Then verse 4 says that the church at Jerusalem received them. The church at Antioch sent them, and the church at Jerusalem received them. It is really good. They were sent by one local church, and they were received by another. Then notice verse 22: it pleased not only the apostles and the elders, but also the whole church to send certain men to Antioch. Again the Holy Spirit would not use the word &ldquo;believers,&rdquo; but the &ldquo;church.&rdquo; It is always the church, the church, the church. Then again in verse 41 it says that the apostle went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</p>
<p>Again in chapter sixteen, verse 5, it says, &ldquo;the churches were established in the faith, and increased in number daily.&rdquo; It does not say the believers, but the churches. What was within the believers in the early days was just the church. Then in chapter eighteen, verse 22, when Paul came to Caesarea, it says he went up and saluted the church&mdash;not the saints, but the church. In chapter twenty, verse 17, when Paul was near to Ephesus, he sent for the elders of the church and said to them, &ldquo;Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock...to feed the church of God.&rdquo; If I were the writer, I would say, &ldquo;feed the children of God.&rdquo; But the Holy Spirit says, &ldquo;feed the church of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these last days may we learn to be so church conscious. This matter is almost totally related to the meetings. May the Lord be merciful to us that henceforth none of us may meet in a churchless way. This is the first principle we must learn for our meetings. Whether we are building up the church or doing something to damage the church all depends on the way we meet. We must meet in a church way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRINCIPLES OF MEETING<br />
FROM THE GOSPELS AND THE ACTS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PART ONE</h2>
<p>We have seen something concerning the matter of meeting from the middle of the Gospel of Matthew. Now we come to the end of the Gospels. We all know that the record at the end of the Gospels follows the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. Now we are in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, and in this record we can see many things regarding the matter of how we should meet. Have you realized that within that short time following the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and before His ascension He had a good number of meetings with His disciples? That was a record of the way the Lord meets with His own. At the end of the four Gospels there is a full record showing us how to meet.</p>
<p>With all the cases and examples in the Bible there are principles. They are not just cases; they are not just Bible stories. We must see the principle in each case, something spiritual, something divine, something deeper and even hidden. We must learn to see what is behind all the stories of the Bible. Here, at the end of the four Gospels, we have the record of the Lord after His resurrection meeting with His disciples many times. He even asked them to meet Him at a certain place which He appointed. Based upon this record, I would like to present to you six principles of how to meet.</p>
<h2 class="head1">1. OUTSIDE OF RELIGION WITHOUT ANY FORMS</h2>
<p>The first principle is this: all the meetings requested by the Lord, appointed by Him, and attended by Him were outside of religion and without any forms. We must know the background, we must know the situation at that time. All the disciples were Jewish people, godly people; they had the temple, and that was the place where they should meet to worship God. All God&rsquo;s people, according to their religion, went to the temple to meet and to worship, to offer the sacrifices, to observe the rituals, and to keep the forms. That was their background and environment at that time. But have you noticed this? All the meetings Jesus requested, appointed, and attended were absolutely outside of that religion and had nothing whatever to do with its forms. Those meetings were really informal; they were totally detached from religion.</p>
<p>Today, in principle, we are in the same situation as those early disciples. We also have a religious background with today&rsquo;s temples, rituals and forms. What shall we do? I tell you, religion for us must be a thing of the past. When Jesus was resurrected, religion was over. With resurrection, there is no need of any religion, for we have the living Christ. What about the temple? you may ask. The living Christ is the living temple&mdash;the physical temple was just a photo of the real. If an intimate friend or relation of yours is not with you, you may like to have his or her photo. But if the living person is in your presence, what need is there any longer of the photo? Before Jesus came in person and was resurrected, God&rsquo;s people did need the temple. But now the living temple is here; Christ as the living temple is here. What about the offerings&mdash;the trespass offering, the sin offering, the peace offering, the meal offering, and the burnt offering? All these are simply photos of the different aspects of Christ. Now Christ is here. Christ is every kind of offering. Since He is here, what need have we any longer of the photos? Since the resurrected Christ is here, we do not need any religion, forms, or rituals. Christ is all in all; Christ is everything.</p>
<p>But to know something is one thing, and to practice it in reality is quite another. Peter, John, and all the disciples were so clear that Christ was resurrected and they no longer needed religion. According to the way Christ met with them, the example was already established. But have you noticed that even after the day of Pentecost the early Christians still went to the temple? That was in a sense a kind of offense to the Lord. I tell you, that was the reason why in 70 A.D., not long after their meeting in the temple, the Lord sent the Roman army to destroy the temple, to get rid of all the background of religion. How clear the Lord Jesus made to the disciples the matter of how to meet. All His meetings with them were absolutely apart from religion, and yet they continued to attend the temple. Of course, on one hand the Lord is not so narrow, but on the other hand that was a kind of mixture. Even in Acts 21, after the Apostle Paul had written the Epistle to the Romans and the Galatians, he went up to Jerusalem, and James and all the elders advised him, &ldquo;You see, brother, how many Jewish believers there are who keep the law and observe the rituals of the old religion. We advise you to do the same.&rdquo; We must realize that that was not the right thing for Paul to do; it was a kind of degradation from the Lord&rsquo;s example. The Lord set forth some examples, but the disciples soon forgot them. It is really difficult to get away from the old religion. It is really difficult to abandon all the rituals and forms; sometimes these things are in our very blood.</p>
<p>Consider the way the Lord met with the disciples after His resurrection. Not one of these meetings was held in the old religious way. Sometimes for fear of the Jews they shut the doors and met in an atmosphere of disappointment; then suddenly the Lord Jesus came and stood in their midst (John 20:19-29). Sometimes He met them at the seashore while they were in a backslidden condition. He had told them to stay at Jerusalem, and they backslid to the sea. But He met with them anyway; Jesus was there on the seashore as the real temple (John 21:1-22). Sometimes He met with them on the mountain (Matt. 28:16-20). You see, there was no form; the meetings were absolutely apart from religion. What is the meaning of this for us today? It is this: the meetings we need to have are meetings which are absolutely outside of today&rsquo;s Christianity. How should we meet? We should meet outside of religion, outside of Christianity, without any form. We are still too religious, too formal. All our religion and form must be dealt with. Why must we establish and keep so many forms? The Lord did not establish any forms. The Lord be merciful to us.</p>
<p>We must never forget the principle of the first mention of any matter in the Bible. It is exceedingly important: it always gives the principle concerning that matter and sets the course. These meetings at the end of the four Gospels and the beginning of the book of Acts were the first meetings of the churches. So here we have the principle established for the way of meeting: we must meet outside of religion, without any form.</p><h2 class="head1">2. IN RESURRECTION AS THE LORD&rsquo;S BRETHREN</h2>
<p>The second principle of meeting is that we must meet in resurrection as the Lord&rsquo;s brethren. Do we have the boldness to say that we are meeting as the very brothers of the Lord? We should. We can. We are the Lord&rsquo;s brothers&mdash;Hallelujah! We are meeting with the status of His brothers. We are not sinners, we are not even seekers; we are the Lord&rsquo;s brothers. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Go tell my brethren.&rdquo; When we come to meet, we are coming to meet our Brother. Oh, this is not a small thing! How could we be the Lord&rsquo;s brothers? In resurrection! We were born again through the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3); so we have become the Lord&rsquo;s brothers. He is the Son of God, and we also are sons of God. He has God&rsquo;s life, and we have too. He has God&rsquo;s nature, and we also have God&rsquo;s nature. He is no longer God&rsquo;s only begotten Son: now by His resurrection He has become God&rsquo;s firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29), and we are the many sons of God (Heb. 2:10). He is our Brother, and we are His brethren. The Lord said, &ldquo;Go tell my brethren,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Go tell my disciples,&rdquo; not &ldquo;Go tell the sinful people.&rdquo; He said that He wanted to meet with His brothers. This corresponds with what He says in Hebrews 2:12, &ldquo;I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church...&rdquo;</p>
<p>We know that when Thomas saw the resurrected Lord, he said, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo; In a sense that was good. You may admire his saying, but if Thomas were clear and bold, he would say, &ldquo;O my big Brother! O my Brother Jesus!&rdquo; Do you think that if the Lord came to His disciples as the very Lord and God He would speak in such an intimate way, &ldquo;Thomas thrust your hand into my side&rdquo;? This would not be the attitude and appeal of one who came as Lord and God. This was one who came as our <em>Brother.</em></p>
<p>But we must realize that we are not His brethren in our old nature; we are His brethren only in resurrection. Whenever we come to the meetings, we must come as the Lord&rsquo;s brothers in resurrection. Therefore, we should never bring anything of the old nature into the meeting. This is more than basic.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s Christian meetings one has the sense that those who attend are so much in the old nature and the meetings are still so natural. Let me give you an illustration. For the brothers and sisters in the Far East to shout in the meetings is very difficult. Their nature is always to keep themselves silent and hidden. But on the other hand, the Westerners are altogether too frank. This is another manifestation of the old nature. When we meet as Christians, we must forget our natural disposition. We must meet just as the brothers of Jesus. We are not Chinese and we are not Westerners, we are just the little brothers of Jesus. If people ask if I come from China, I would tell them, &ldquo;No, I come from the third heaven!&rdquo; Praise the Lord! A brother once told me that he had never met a Chinese like me. I said he was absolutely right. I am really not a Chinese; I am a brother of the Lord in resurrection. This is how we must meet.</p>
<p>In a sense I agree that the sisters should be quiet, but in another sense I do not agree, for even the sisters are brothers of Christ. Christ does not have any sisters; all He has are brothers. You must forget that you are sisters. Do not come to the meetings in a natural way, considering yourselves as sisters. I know that many now will immediately condemn me and say that I am encouraging people to forget their position. But really we all need to forget our position, our natural position, and take our standing in the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>Now I come to the elderly ones. Some elderly brothers and sisters excuse themselves by saying they are old and slow: they would like to participate in the meeting, but all the opportunities are taken by the younger people. In a sense I agree with you, but in another sense I do not agree with you. Christ does not have older brothers; His brothers in resurrection are all so young. We all must be young in resurrection.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus after His resurrection attended many meetings with His disciples. He always came to the meetings in resurrection, and He counted upon them as resurrected people. Concerning the matter of resurrection, we do need faith. When Jesus was on this earth, before His crucifixion, people came to know Him without any need of faith. But after the resurrection, if we would know Christ, we need faith. When the disciples were meeting with doors shut for fear of the Jews, Jesus suddenly appeared in their midst. Can you tell me how Jesus entered? You may say that He came in as a Spirit. But He had a physical body&mdash;how can you answer this? I tell you, the matter of resurrection is a matter of faith. Thomas was not there. Thomas missed Jesus and said that he would never believe unless he touched Him. So at the next meeting the Lord appeared again and presented Himself for Thomas to touch. Thomas exclaimed, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo; Then the Lord said, &ldquo;Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed.&rdquo; This is resurrection, and resurrection requires faith.</p>
<p>This matter is exceedingly practical and applicable to our attending of the meetings. When you come to the meetings, do not look at yourself; look at Him. Do not look at your situation; look at what He is. We need faith. When you come to the meeting, do not come by yourself, do not count on yourself. Sometimes by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy you have some good experiences of the Lord during the day; so you come to the meeting shouting &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; But at other times your experiences are not so good, and you come to the meeting depressed. You may say that you have had many failures. But, Hallelujah, you have the blood; the blood covers all your failures. Immediately, by applying the blood, you can be in the third heaven. Immediately, you can be in resurrection. When we come to the meeting, we should not come as one who has had so many failures, or even as one who is only seeking the Lord, but as one of the Lord&rsquo;s brethren in resurrection. The blood is so available. It is the blood that cleanses away all our sins. I know many brothers who would say that since they have failed so terribly during the day they cannot be immediately recovered; they say that they must wait a week or so before they can be fully restored. But this means that the blood does not avail, but the time. This means that they are not trusting in the blood, but in the time. They do not apply the blood to their failures, they just apply the time to their failures. Do we trust in time, or do we trust in the blood? By the precious blood we can be immediately restored and enter into the meetings as the Lord&rsquo;s brethren in resurrection. We do have a standing for us to meet with Jesus: it is the standing of the brethren of Christ in His resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">3. MEETING WITH SOME PERSONAL<br />
EXPERIENCES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Read the last chapters of the four Gospels. So many of the disciples had some personal experiences of Christ. Mary did&mdash;you know the story. Early in the morning of the day of resurrection Mary received an experience of Christ (John 20:11-18). The two disciples walking to Emmaus also received a vital, personal experience of Him. They were so zealous for Christ, and suddenly Christ came and joined them. They did not know it was the Lord, but later when they constrained Him to abide with them, their eyes were opened and they recognized Him. Then He vanished out of their sight. Immediately they decided to turn back to Jerusalem, and arriving there, they found a meeting in progress. In the meeting they were told how the Lord was resurrected and had appeared to Simon, and it seemed that they said, &ldquo;Amen, we saw Him too.&rdquo; Then suddenly Jesus Himself appeared again (Luke 24:1-36).</p>
<p>All these verses show how so many of the disciples in the early days, before they were in the meetings, had some strange, wonderful, and precious experiences of Christ. We also need to have this kind of personal experiences of our dear Lord in our daily life. Then when we come to the meeting, we have something bubbling and overflowing from us as a testimony to all the others. We have something as our experiences of Christ to speak about in the meeting. You know, many times when we are sharing something of our experiences of the Lord in the meeting, while we are talking, Jesus Himself is with us; we are so conscious of His presence in our midst. In our daily walk, we do need some extra portion from a sweet contact with the Lord Jesus that we may have something to bring to the meeting. Take this principle and put it into practice. Day by day we should have some personal, intimate, sweet contact with the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Many times I have had the same kind of experience as those two brothers going to Emmaus. Many times when I have opened the Bible, it seemed that I could not see Jesus in the Word; but after a while, it was so wonderful, Jesus appeared. My heart was bubbling and burning within me; then suddenly, it seemed that He disappeared, and I was so disappointed. Have you ever had this kind of experience? Then I have felt that I must go to the meeting and tell the brothers what a wonderful, personal contact I&rsquo;ve had with Jesus that day and how He seemed to disappear. When I have gone to the meeting and while I was giving such a testimony, there Jesus was! Many times it is like this. We do need the personal, sweet experiences of the resurrected Christ in our daily walk.</p>
<h2 class="head1">4. MEETING AT THE PLACE APPOINTED BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>The next principle is that we must meet at the place appointed by Jesus, not the place chosen by us. The disciples were told to go into Galilee and there they would see Him (Matt. 28:7). &ldquo;Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them&rdquo; (Matt. 28:16). Why did the Lord Jesus not tell His disciples that He would meet with them in Jerusalem? He was resurrected in the area of Jerusalem; why would He go far to the north, to Galilee, to meet with His disciples? The Lord did this deliberately, purposely, to move the Christian meeting away from the Jewish religious center. The meeting which He appointed had nothing to do with Jerusalem, nothing to do with the temple. The Lord wanted the meetings to be absolutely removed from religion.</p>
<p>Today, in principle, we have no right to choose a place to meet. The choice is not with us, but with Him. If we have the prerogative to choose a place, we are divisive. We all must meet in the place appointed by the Lord. Learn to give up your concept, your choices. We all need to come together in the place which the Lord appoints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">5. MEETING THE LORD HIMSELF</h2>
<p>Whenever we come to the meeting, we must come with the intention of meeting the Lord. &ldquo;He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him&rdquo; (Matt. 28:7). When we come to a meeting, we must realize that we are coming to meet our Lord. This matter must be emphasized. We always consider that we are coming for edification or for some other purpose. But we need to have a deep realization that our only purpose is to meet our Lord Jesus. We should not care whether there is a good speaker or good message. We should only care to meet our Lord.</p>
<p>Consider all the meetings the Lord Jesus had with His disciples. We could almost say that there was not one meeting with a message. Have you noticed that? But Jesus always stood in their midst. They saw the Lord&mdash;that was enough. We do not need the teachings, we do not need the messages; all we need is the presence of the Lord. When we see Him, we can rejoice. We go to the meeting not to hear a great speaker; we go to the meeting to meet Jesus. We do not go to the meeting to listen to a good message. We go to the meeting to meet our Lord. When we see Jesus in the meeting we can say, Hallelujah! We just rejoice at His presence. &ldquo;He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">6. MEETING TO SATISFY THE LORD<br />
AND BE SATISFIED BY HIM</h2>
<p>The meaning and purpose of the proper meeting is to give the Lord something to eat and also for Him to give us something to eat. Have you noticed that two times in the record of these meetings the Lord asked His disciples if they had something to eat? &ldquo;Have you any meat?&rdquo; He asked. Once they answered Him, &ldquo;No&rdquo; (John 21:5). But praise the Lord, another time they did say, &ldquo;We have a little&rdquo; (Luke 24:41-43). They did not have much, they just had a little, a mere piece of fish. It was not even a whole fish. Look into Darby&rsquo;s translation and some other better translations&mdash;they do not say fish, but just a part of a fish. They just gave Him a part of a fish. In the King James Version you have &ldquo;and of a honeycomb.&rdquo; But in the most trustworthy manuscript you do not have this phrase. What they gave Him was just a part of a fish. But though it was so little, the Lord ate it.</p>
<p>The disciples gave the Lord just a little, but the Lord gave His disciples plenty. When He asked them that day by the seashore if they had any meat and they answered &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Lord gave them a lot. He not only gave them a part of a fish, but plenty of fish. And not only fish, but also bread. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Come and dine,&rdquo; and they did (John 21:12-15). How to meet? We must meet to satisfy the Lord and be satisfied by Him. To meet is to eat. Our meeting must be a kind of eating, a kind of feasting. We bring something as a feast for Christ, and Christ brings something as a feast for us. Christ comes to the meeting to feast with us and we with Him. Every Christian meeting should be a feast which satisfies both the Lord and us. If we are not satisfied in our meeting, we are wrong. In all our meetings we need a table, a mutual table. We eat together with Him. We have something for Him, and He has something for us. Undoubtedly He has more for us than we have for Him. What we can afford Him is just a little, just a limited portion, but what He can afford us is unlimited and inexhaustible.</p>
<p>We need to take all these basic principles and put them into practice. We must always be outside of religion without any form; we must always meet in resurrection as the Lord&rsquo;s brethren; we must meet with some personal experience of Christ in the place chosen and appointed by Him; and we must gather to meet the Lord, to satisfy Him and be satisfied by Him. If we can find all these principles in our meetings, we are right and we have the proper Christian meetings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRINCIPLES OF MEETING<br />
FROM THE GOSPELS AND THE ACTS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PART TWO</h2>
<p>In the last chapter we have covered six principles of meeting from the last chapters of the Gospels and the opening chapters of the book of Acts. Now we will consider another eight principles. From all the instances of the Lord Jesus meeting with His disciples after His resurrection we can see fourteen principles regarding the matter of meeting.</p>
<p>We must realize that after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, including the time of Pentecost, the record we have is that of the Lord Jesus continually meeting with His disciples. Have you realized that when the Lord was resurrected His disciples were immediately requested to meet together? In other words, after the resurrection, the disciples immediately became a meeting people. When we read Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20 and 21, and Acts 1 and 2, we see that the disciples did nothing but meet. I do believe they met every day. They resigned their jobs, they surrendered their homes, they gave up everything for meeting. From the morning of the resurrection day the Lord began to meet with them, not only with a good number in one place, but also with one or two. In the morning of the resurrection day He met firstly with Mary (John 20:14-18), then with a few sisters (Matt. 28:8-10; Luke 24:9-11); in the afternoon He met with two brothers (Luke 24:13-31); then in the evening He came and met with all His disciples (John 20:19-23; Luke 24:36-49). From that day either the Lord made His presence manifest or He hid Himself. But the disciples continually came together. Meeting together became their life, their business, their occupation. They were a meeting people.</p>
<p>In the past years, Christians have paid much attention to the stories of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, but they have neither apprehended the principles of meeting nor applied these principles to today&rsquo;s Christian meetings. Now the Lord has opened our eyes and shown us in all these stories many principles of how to meet. Therefore, we must apply all these to our present meetings. We need to have them wrought into our beings. Whatever we are, wherever we go, we must apply them, forgetting the old way of Christianity. We do need the Lord&rsquo;s deliverance from all the old ways of meeting.</p>
<p>I have mentioned already that Peter and John with all the other disciples in the early days, though they had seen and met with the Lord in His resurrection, automatically continued to frequent the temple. Why did they do this? Because they were used to it, they were accustomed to going to the temple. We cannot find a word in the New Testament telling Peter and John that they should do so. In principle the Lord Jesus told them, &ldquo;Go to Galilee; I will meet you there.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;Go to the mountain; I will meet you there.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus never told them to go to the temple. Doing this, however, was in their blood. Today it is the same. We do have some temples today&mdash;the old way of Christian &ldquo;services.&rdquo; I do not like to hear this word &ldquo;service&rdquo; applied to our meeting&mdash;&ldquo;We are going to the Sunday service.&rdquo; This use of the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; spoils the real meaning of the word. Service in its spiritual meaning refers to serving the Lord. Do you believe that in today&rsquo;s Christianity there is some real service rendered to the Lord on Sunday mornings? We all must come out of that old religion and leave everything associated with it. I am afraid that some have come out, but are still wearing the old religious cloak. We need to not only come out from it, but leave all its trappings. Take them off and throw them away. We need to meet in an up-to-date and absolutely new way.</p>
<p>The new way of meeting is fully revealed in all the records of the Lord Jesus meeting with His disciples. After His resurrection, He came back again and again to meet with them, and in the record of these occasions we see Him setting up the principles of meeting. By His examples we have the principles. We have seen six of these; now let us consider the seventh.</p><h2 class="head1">7. MEETING TO WORSHIP HIM</h2>
<p>In Matthew 28 we read that when they saw the Lord Jesus on the mountain, immediately they worshipped Him (Matt. 28:16-17). When we meet with the Lord in His resurrection, we meet on one hand as His very brothers, but on the other hand we have to worship Him. It is not just to greet Him, not just to hail Him as did His disciples, but to worship Him. This does not mean that we need to kneel. We may kneel or we may not kneel. To worship Him means to adore and exalt Him as the very Lord in our spirit. If the situation permits us to kneel, that is good; but many times it is not so convenient. In any case, it is not a matter of outward forms, but absolutely of the inward spirit. We need to worship Him. We need to adore and exalt Him in our spirit. We need to praise Him, sometimes even with shouting&mdash;&ldquo;Hallelujah! Jesus is the Lord!&rdquo; I would say that to shout in this way is much better than kneeling in deadly quietness. The worship I am speaking of is not the dead worship of today&rsquo;s Christianity. I tell you, if a young sister could shout in the meeting, &ldquo;Jesus is my Lord, Hallelujah!&rdquo; that would be marvelous worship.</p>
<p>This is real and living worship. It is not a religious performance. It is in the Spirit exalting, adoring, and magnifying the Lord Jesus. Do not bring that old, dead, religious way of worshipping into the meetings. We must keep ourselves so living in the matter of worshipping the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">8. MEETING TO BE BREATHED UPON BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>In John chapter twenty we read that when the Lord Jesus met with His disciples, He breathed upon them (v. 22). Oh, how we need the Lord to breathe upon us when we meet together! I have heard the saints pray many times before they have come to the meeting: &ldquo;O Lord, give us a good speaker. Lord, You know Your church today needs sound teaching.&rdquo; I believe that some of you in the past have prayed in this way. But we must pray, &ldquo;Lord, we need Thy breathing. This day, in the day of Your resurrection, breathe upon us.&rdquo; Brothers and sisters, we do not need so much teaching, but we do need the breathing. So many teachings kill us. It is the Lord breathing upon us that makes us alive; it is the breathing that gives life and imparts Christ into us. We all have to pray, &ldquo;Lord, in our meetings we need Thy breathing much more than any kind of teaching. Give us a gracious visitation, Lord, and breathe upon us; breathe upon every one who comes to the meeting.&rdquo; We need to pray in this way before every meeting. Forget about the old way. Take the way the Lord set before us by meeting with His disciples after His resurrection. Perhaps in your entire Christian life you have never heard anyone speak about coming to a meeting to be breathed upon. But it is so clearly mentioned in John chapter twenty. In the first evening after His resurrection, the Lord came to His disciples, and the main thing He did was to breathe upon them. This was their basic need, and this also is our basic need. Therefore, this is a basic principle for our meeting together with the Lord Jesus. Are we willing to receive His breathing?</p>
<p>This matter of breathing is of two aspects: He breathes out and we breathe in; He exhales and we inhale. If we shut ourselves, though He breathes upon us, we get nothing. We must learn to open ourselves to Him and say, &ldquo;Lord, we are not just opening our listening ears or our understanding minds, we are opening our receiving spirit. Our ears are open to Thee, our mind is open to Thee, and even the more, our spirit is open to Thy breathing, Lord. O Lord, breathe Thyself into us. Regardless of whether we understand or not, O Lord, breathe upon us. We would like to receive something of Thyself deeply within our spirit.&rdquo; We need to prepare ourselves for the meetings in this way. A radical change is needed to rid ourselves of the old ways. Even while we are in the meeting we need to say, &ldquo;O Lord, I am here open to Thee. I only want to breathe in Thyself. O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; This really refreshes.</p>
<p>We really enjoy pray-reading the Word together in the meetings. It is much better than preaching or teaching, because it includes breathing. When we pray-read the Word, we just breathe the Lord Jesus into us. We have received some letters recently from some in a distant land who recently became acquainted with pray-reading the Word. They practiced it and were much impressed, but they wrote expressing the fear that they were not practicing it correctly. However, I believe they need not be concerned. All they need is simply to open themselves to the Word and breathe it in. It is the exercising of our spirit to inhale what the Lord exhales. This is the breathing upon us of the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit. When He came to His disciples after His resurrection, He came as the life-giving Spirit and breathed upon them. He is doing the same today. If we are open to Him, He is breathing out and we are breathing in. This is one of the main principles of meeting. We all need to help the new ones when we come together to give the Lord an opening to breathe something of Himself into them. We come together not to receive some teaching, but to be breathed upon by the Lord Jesus&mdash;to take in the Lord Jesus by breathing.</p><h2 class="head1">9. MEETING FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In all these cases of the Lord meeting with His disciples after His resurrection, He spoke to them. Every time in their meetings they had the Lord&rsquo;s speaking, the Lord&rsquo;s new speaking. Whenever we come together, we need the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. This is nothing of a teaching coming from dead knowledge, dead doctrine, dead theology. The Lord&rsquo;s speaking is something new, something which is not only constant, but instant and up-to-date. We need the Lord&rsquo;s living, up-to-date and instant speaking. It is based upon the Lord&rsquo;s breathing. If the Lord is free to breathe upon us, He is also free to speak to us. This kind of speaking today may be through you or through another. Sometimes it may be through a young brother, a new convert. We do not mean that the Lord&rsquo;s speaking will necessarily come through a good speaker. Let us forget the term &ldquo;speaker.&rdquo; If we use this term, we must realize that every one of us is a speaker. Are you not a speaker? You speak all the day. Some of the sisters are excellent speakers in their homes. Sometimes people ask, &ldquo;Who is the speaker in your meeting today?&rdquo; What would you answer? You may say, &ldquo;the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; That would be right and good, but you should also be able to answer that all the attendants are speakers. If we have 501 attendants, we should have 501 speakers. If we have 501 attendants and only 499 speakers, we are wrong; we are short of two. I know that some will not say Amen to this, because they are afraid to be this kind of a speaker.</p>
<p>There is a great difference, obviously, between this kind of meeting and fallen Christianity. In the living church meetings, all the attendants are speakers. We all need to be a mouthpiece for the Lord Jesus. Today the Lord may speak through you, and tomorrow He may speak through others. We all must be ready for the Lord to speak something to His church through us. Read all the cases of these meetings in the Scriptures again. In every case the Lord spoke, and He spoke much.</p>
<h2 class="head1">10. MEETING TO KNOW CHRIST<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>The disciples were with the Lord for three and a half years before His resurrection, but they did not know Him well. They knew Him in the flesh, but they did not know Him in the Spirit. They were with Him, but they were ignorant of Him. It was not till after His resurrection that the Lord met with His disciples and purposely opened their understanding by opening the Scriptures. &ldquo;And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself&rdquo; (Luke 24:27). At that time there was only the Old Testament, including the books of the Law, the Psalms and the Prophets. The Lord Jesus opened up the entire Old Testament to point out to them who He is. He helped them to know Himself through the Scriptures (Luke 24:44-47).</p>
<p>Today we still need this. We still need to know Christ with an opened Bible. We need a spiritual understanding with the Scriptures opened in such a way that we see all the secrets behind the writings. So in our meetings we must look to the Lord that He would grant us this, that He would give us an opened Bible that we may see more things of Christ. We need Him to breathe upon us, but we still need the proper understanding of who He is. Christ opened the Bible and the understanding of the disciples that they may really know Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">11. MEETING TO SEE<br />
THE RESURRECTED AND ASCENDED CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the meetings that the Lord Jesus had with His disciples, they saw the resurrected Christ. Before the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion, they saw Christ in the flesh, they did not see Him as the resurrected One. But after His resurrection, every time they saw Him they saw Him in resurrection. Today in every meeting we need to see the Lord Jesus as the resurrected One&mdash;not just to understand Him, but to see Him.</p>
<p>Thomas was not in the first meeting with the Lord Jesus; he missed the opportunity of seeing the resurrected Christ with all the others. Then when Thomas came in the next meeting (John 20:24-29), the Lord Jesus showed Himself to Thomas in resurrection. Thomas not only understood that He was resurrected, but he saw Him, the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the last meeting the Lord had with His disciples, they saw Him as the ascended Christ (Acts 1:6-11). This is not a small matter. In all our meetings we need to see that the very Christ with whom we are meeting is the resurrected One and also the ascended One. And we are all identified with Him. He is resurrected and we are resurrected in Him. He is ascended, and we are ascended in Him. If we realize this, our meetings will not only be in resurrection, but also in ascension. The praising will burst forth. We will all say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, we are in the heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we read carefully the account of the Lord Jesus meeting with His disciples, we cannot find a hint that some of the disciples were sorrowful in the meeting. Before the Lord Jesus came to meet with them, perhaps some were sorrowful, but when they saw Him they were excited and glad (John 20:20). Tell me, if you were there that day on the Mount of Olives and saw the Lord Jesus ascending into the heavens, could you be still, could you be calm? This is the proper way for us to come together: whenever we meet, we need to see the One who is resurrected and ascended. Today we meet not with the Jesus who was in the flesh, but with the resurrected and ascended Christ.</p>
<p>In the Psalms we have the Songs of degrees (Psalms 120 to 134). When the people of Israel were ascending Mount Zion to be at the feast in the presence of the Lord, they sang the Songs of degrees. Today we need some new Songs of degrees, some new songs of coming up to the meetings. They should go something like this: &ldquo;Oh, we are going to see the resurrected Christ, we are going to see the ascended Christ in our meeting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disciples met with the resurrected and ascended Christ in their meetings. Is this not wonderful? Then what kind of Christ do we come to meet with in our meetings? Yes, the resurrected and ascended Christ! We are with Him in resurrection and we are with Him in ascension. Learn to meet Him in this new way. If we meet with such a One, all the problems, all the traditions, and all the religion will be under our feet. We will be in resurrection and ascension. The Lord Jesus is not just our Savior, He is the resurrected and ascended One. He said to Thomas, &ldquo;Touch me and see what kind of Christ I am. Touch and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How could Peter and the one hundred and twenty be so bold on the Day of Pentecost? Because they saw the resurrected and ascended Christ. After they saw Christ ascend into the heavens, they went back to their place, and regardless of what others thought of them, regardless of what others did to them, they did not care. They were so strengthened and released by such a vision. Do we need the teachings? Do we need the doctrines? There is a place for them, but above all we need to see the resurrected and ascended Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">12. MEETING FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S COMMISSION</h2>
<p>The Lord did something more: when He met with His disciples after His resurrection He gave them a commission (Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:47-48; Acts 1:8). He told them to go and preach repentance and remission of sins. Moreover, He told them to go to be His witnesses, His living witnesses. And He told them to disciple the nations and baptize them into the Triune God. This is the Gospel preaching; in the Bible the Gospel preaching includes all these things&mdash;the preaching of repentance and forgiveness, the reality of all the preachers as living witnesses of Jesus Christ, and the baptizing of people into the Triune God. To bring the Triune God to people and to bring people and put people into the Triune God is the Gospel. We are not bringing people into Christianity or a kind of religion, but into the Triune God. This is the commission the Lord gave to His disciples.</p>
<p>Today, if we meet in the proper way, surely we will be commissioned with something by the Lord. In John 21:15-23, after the disciples had dined together, the Lord asked Peter three times if he loved Him. And then the Lord said to him, &ldquo;Feed my lambs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Feed my sheep.&rdquo; This is the commission in the meetings. It not only includes the Gospel preaching, but also the feeding of the lambs, the younger ones, and the sheep, the older ones. If we meet properly in all the meetings, there should be some kind of burden transmitted from the Lord to us. We will be burdened by the Lord with something for His move. If we can meet week after week and year after year without receiving any kind of commission, we are wrong. I am not urging you to get busy in some kind of Christian activity, but I am saying that if we meet in a living way, the Lord will commission us time after time with some of His work. We will be commissioned with something of the Lord. In the proper meetings the Lord is acting all the time to commission people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">13. MEETING TO PRAY</h2>
<p>In Acts chapter one we see that after the disciples met with the Lord Jesus, after they saw Him ascend to the heavens, they returned to Jerusalem and were occupied continually in prayer (Acts 1:12-14). What kind of prayers did they pray? Did they ask the Lord to give them good jobs? This is the kind of prayer in today&rsquo;s poor Christianity. We need to pray for the Lord&rsquo;s move. We need to pray for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. We need to pray for the building up of the churches. If we seek first His Kingdom and His righteousness, all we need will be added to us (Matt. 6:31-33). We need not and must not spend so much time and energy praying for jobs or housing, etc. Forget about this. There is no need sometimes even to pray for health. If we care for the Lord&rsquo;s Kingdom, He will care for all we need. If we seek His Kingdom, He will give us His Kingdom with so many other things added. We all have to learn how to pray. This is one of the principles concerning the matter of how to meet. We need to meet in this way: to pray in one accord for the Kingdom, for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, for the building up of the local churches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">14. MEETING FOR THE EMPOWERING<br />
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>On the Day of Pentecost when the disciples met together, suddenly the Holy Spirit filled the room where they were sitting, and they were all clothed with power from on high (Acts 2:1-4). In so many meetings we do need this kind of empowering. While we are meeting in a proper way, suddenly we will simply be empowered from the heavens.</p>
<p>Pray over these chapters of the Gospels and the book of Acts again and again to be deeply impressed with these principles. It is useless only to know them. May the Lord be merciful to us that we may put them into practice. This is the proper way for us to meet with the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">WITH THE RESURRECTED CHRIST<br />
AND FOR THE ASCENDED CHRIST</h1>
<p>Let us enumerate all the meetings which the Lord Jesus had with His disciples after His resurrection. On the day of His resurrection, He firstly appeared to one sister, Mary Magdalene (John 20:11-18; Mark 16:9-11); then the second time, also in the morning, He appeared to a few sisters (Matt. 28:8-10; Luke 24:9-11). Later in the day He appeared to Peter (Luke 24:34; 1 Cor. 15:5). Then in the afternoon or evening He appeared to two disciples as they walked to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35; Mark 16:12-13). At night, when all the disciples were gathered together, Jesus met with them&mdash;that was the first meeting He had with a good number of His disciples after the resurrection (John 20:19-23; Luke 24:36-49). Then, on the next Lord&rsquo;s day, a week later, He appeared again to have the second meeting with them. In the first meeting Thomas was missing, but in the second meeting he was there (John 20:24-29). After these two meetings, which were held behind closed doors in Jerusalem, the disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain appointed by Him. There He met with them (Matt. 28:10, 16-20). Another time He met with them on the shore of the Sea of Galilee (John 21:1-24). Then, according to 1 Corinthians 15:6, the Lord appeared to five hundred brethren at once. He even appeared to James, His brother in the flesh (1 Cor. 15:7). Then, eventually, He met with them back in Judea on the Mount of Olives, quite near to Jerusalem, where, in full view of His disciples, He was received up to the heavens (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:6-13). From the Mount of Olives, they returned to Jerusalem and went up into an upper room, where they met together for continual prayer. There they tarried, as they were commanded by the Lord, till they were clothed upon with power from on high (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-5).</p>
<p>Of all these meetings we can discern two kinds: the first is the meetings with the resurrected Christ; the second is the meetings for the ascended Christ. What kind of meetings are we having today? Today people say they are having Bible study meetings, prayer meetings, fellowship meetings, Gospel meetings, etc. I would not say it is wrong to arrange things in this way, but we must realize that whenever we meet, we meet firstly with the resurrected Christ and then for the ascended Christ.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed a change, or we may say a contradiction, in the last chapters of the four Gospels and the opening chapter of the book of Acts? In both Matthew and John, there is no record of the Lord Jesus having ascended. According to these Gospels, He is still here. Matthew says, &ldquo;Lo, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age&rdquo; (Matt. 28:20, J. N. Darby&rsquo;s translation). Accordingly, the Lord Jesus is still on this earth; He has never left us. We may have full assurance that the Lord Jesus is among us at this very moment. Hallelujah! John also did not tell us anything regarding the Lord&rsquo;s ascension. Why? Because John&rsquo;s message is that the Lord is the life within us forever. He could never leave us, for He is our very life. Matthew tells us that the Lord Jesus met with the disciples on the mountain. John tells us that He met with His disciples on the one hand in a room shut up, secretly, and on the other hand by the seashore. That is all. Neither Matthew nor John tells us that after this, the disciples saw Jesus ascend into the heavens. According to the record of Matthew and John, the meetings which the Lord Jesus held with His disciples were of the first kind, the meetings with the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>Then we come to the Gospels of Mark and Luke and the book of Acts. These three books tell us clearly that this resurrected Christ who met with His disciples after His resurrection ascended to the heavens. While He was holding one of the meetings with His own, He ascended up before them. The worldly people did not see Him, but His disciples steadfastly beheld Him received into heaven. Who could take away such an impression from them? This was not something of doctrine or information&mdash;this was the greatest sight-seeing! They all <em>saw</em> the ascension. Once you have seen something, you can never say that you have not seen it. In a sense, they did not see His resurrection. They saw the empty tomb, but they did not see Jesus in the act of being resurrected. But they saw His ascension. They not only saw the ascended Christ, but the ascension itself. If I were there, I would jump in excitement. This is the reason Peter became so bold and probably determined he would never go back to fishing. &ldquo;For this,&rdquo; he said in effect, &ldquo;it is worthwhile to sacrifice my life.&rdquo; Suppose that today, before your very eyes, you saw the Lord ascending. Could you sleep? I&rsquo;m afraid that if I saw the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, I could not sleep for three days! I would be beside myself. I would shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah! I saw Jesus ascending!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say again, this is not a kind of teaching or information; this is a kind of sight-seeing. So many people went to Cape Kennedy to see Apollo 13 leave for the moon. But the disciples on that day saw Jesus ascend not to the moon, but to the heavens. It is marvelous! Immediately their meetings were changed into another category. Before they met <em>with</em> Christ; now they began to meet <em>for</em> Christ. Before they met with the resurrected Christ; now they met for the ascended Christ. Let us look into these two kinds of meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING WITH THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</h2>
<p>We all must learn to meet with the resurrected Christ, not just with the Bible, not just with the hymn book, not just with some chairs and a piano, not just with the saints.</p>
<p>What kind of Christ is the resurrected Christ? It is so clear that He is the very Christ who is living in the Spirit. The resurrected Christ is the living Christ in the Spirit; in fact, He is just the life-giving Spirit. The main thing that this resurrected Christ did in this kind of meeting was to breathe into His disciples and say to them, &ldquo;Receive ye the Holy Breath&rdquo; (John 20:22). It is also in this kind of meeting that Christ speaks and asks of us something to eat and offers us something to eat. This is the first kind of meeting, the meeting with the resurrected Christ, the life-giving Christ, the Christ who is so living in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Where is this Christ today? Yes, in our spirit. We all have to say, Hallelujah! This Christ is within us! This is the resurrected Christ, not the ascended Christ. This is the Christ who is so living as the Spirit within us, not the One who is so powerful in the heavens.</p>
<p>By what way do we meet with this Christ? Be sure that with this Christ we meet without any forms. We may meet Him with all the doors shut, or we may meet Him on the mountain top. It is interesting that there is no name given to this mountain. Any mountain will do to meet the resurrected Christ&mdash;as long as there is a mountain, that is sufficient. And while we are backslidden at the seashore we may still meet Him there. When we are in the room, He is there; when we get to the mountain top, He is there; when we are backslidden at the sea, He is also there. You may say, &ldquo;It is rather difficult to remain here for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony; let us go back to the world.&rdquo; Even so, when you go, He goes with you. You can never get rid of Christ; you have really got involved. Jesus is the resurrected One, and now He is in you. He is the life-giving Spirit; He is the Spirit that gives life within you all the time. So what kind of forms can we have? My heart is bursting to tell you that if we set up any kind of forms, it is a sinful offense to the Lord. We cannot possibly have any forms when we meet with the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>The disciples were meeting in fear, the doors were shut, and suddenly there was Jesus standing in their midst saying, &ldquo;Peace be unto you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; they might have exclaimed. Then they realized it was the Lord, and they were all so glad. Jesus breathed upon them, and after breathing, He just gave them a short message, a very short message (John 20:19-23). I do believe if we were there, we would say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, please sit down and give us a long message just as You did in the sermon on the mount&mdash;three chapters, Matthew 5, 6, and 7. Or speak to us as you did on the night before You were betrayed in John 14, 15, and 16, followed by a long prayer as in John 17.&rdquo; But the Lord just spoke a few words. Then do you think He said, &ldquo;Now the meeting is dismissed. You go home, and I&rsquo;ll go back to heaven&rdquo;? No, it was not like this. Read the record: the Lord Jesus, just as He came, suddenly disappeared. He did not come in by knocking: He did not enter in a formal way. And He did not give them a long message. He did something very extraordinary&mdash;He breathed upon them. And then He disappeared. There was no time limit&mdash;I doubt if they had a clock there. I doubt if they had any special arrangement for their seats. There was absolutely no form. But, I tell you, just from that short time of meeting with the Lord Jesus and being breathed upon by Him, everybody was satisfied. There was just a short visitation, just a little doing, a little breathing, a short message of two or three sentences, and complete satisfaction. They did not call a hymn, nor did they ask brother so and so to offer a prayer, etc. It was a living meeting with a living Christ.</p>
<p>We are still very much under the influence of degraded Christianity. We just need the resurrected Christ, the living Christ, the Christ whom nothing can hold. Even death, the most powerful force in this universe, cannot hold Him. He is the resurrected Christ with the resurrection life. He is meeting now with us, and this is the best way for us to meet. How should we meet? We should meet with the Christ who is the living Spirit; we should meet with the living Christ without any forms.</p>
<p>In the next meeting of the disciples, Jesus suddenly appeared again (John 20:26-29). There is no record telling us how He came in&mdash;He was just there. Do not think that before that time He was not there. He was there all the time. The only difference was that sometimes He appeared and sometimes He disappeared. But whether He appeared or disappeared, He was always with them. Our physical eyes today cannot see Jesus, but we must believe that the Lord Jesus is right here with us. And He is within us. We are not meeting with an ascended Christ; we are meeting with a resurrected Christ. When they arrived at the mountain in Galilee, Jesus was there. When they backslid to the sea to fish, Jesus was there. Before they reached the mountain, where do you suppose Jesus was? Yes, He was within them. Before He appeared to them on the seashore, where was He? He was within them. You see, all the time the Lord Jesus was within them.</p>
<p>We all must realize that whenever we as the disciples of Christ come together, we come with Jesus, we bring Him with us. We come to meet with Him&mdash;not just with a Bible, a hymn book, or with the brothers and sisters, but with the living Christ, the resurrected One, the life-giving Spirit. We all must pray that no one would come to our meetings any more just with a Bible and hymn book. All those who come must come with a full realization that they are coming with the living Christ. We are coming to meet with Christ, the very Christ who breathes Himself into us in all our meetings and the very Christ who speaks to us, even today. We meet to breathe Him in, to speak for Him and let Him speak through us, and to offer Him something for His satisfaction and take something from Him for our satisfaction. It may be just a short meeting, but we will be fully satisfied.</p>
<p>Never forget that these meetings with His disciples after His resurrection were Christ&rsquo;s first meetings with the whole Christian church. This must be the example, and we must heed the principles from these meetings, the first Christian meetings mentioned in the Bible.</p>
<p>In the past years in the local churches we have seen some behavior in the meetings which has not been so becoming. But we dare not do anything. Why? Because we are aware of the background, the dead religion, and we shrink from regulating things and forming another kind of meeting. We would rather tolerate some confusion than any kind of religion. The Lord be merciful to us. He is going to recover all things. He did not go to the temple to meet His disciples; He went to some shut up room, He went to a mountain in Galilee. He did not even notify His disciples that He would be waiting on the seashore for them&mdash;He just went. All the meetings with the resurrected Christ were absolutely outside of religion.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING FOR THE ASCENDED CHRIST</h2>
<p>To meet with Christ, we need to breathe in Christ as life, but to meet for Christ, we need the rushing mighty wind to blow upon us (Acts 2:1-2). To meet for the ascended Christ we need power to demonstrate that the One whom we serve is now in the heavens and has been made Lord and Christ (Acts 2:33-36). We need to declare this to the whole universe. This is the second kind of Christian meeting. Our meetings sometimes need to be like this. We meet not only with the resurrected Christ, but also for the ascended Christ. Our Gospel meeting must be a meeting for the ascended Christ, declaring to the universe that the very Jesus whom the world has rejected has been made Lord and Christ. He is with us and He is within us, but for the unbelievers He is in the heavens. Matthew and John tell us to meet with Christ; Mark, Luke, and Acts tell us to meet for Christ. We need the breathing, and we also need the blowing. We need the breathing of the air for life and the blowing of the mighty wind for power.</p>
<p>For these two kinds of meetings we must pay a price. After the resurrection the disciples were in Jerusalem: they were frightened, they were under threatening and persecution. That was the price they had to pay. They were Galileans; yet they stayed in Jerusalem in an atmosphere of fierce opposition. They paid a price.</p>
<p>Then at a certain time the Lord Jesus told them to go to a mountain in Galilee. If I were Peter, I would have asked, &ldquo;Lord, why must You ask us to go to a mountain in Galilee? I have a large guest room. If You could meet with us here with all the doors shut, why could You not do the same there in Galilee? Why must we go to a mountain?&rdquo; But it is not up to us. If He says to go up to the mountain, what should we do? We should say, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; To say this, however, is easy, but to go up is not so easy. If I decided that we should all go up to the mountain tomorrow, I think that all the sisters would leave me first, saying that I do not care for the children. But the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Go to the mountain,&rdquo; and they did.</p>
<p>Then the Lord Jesus again took the lead and went back to Jerusalem. Why did He not ascend into the heavens from the mountain in Galilee? Why must He go back to the Mount of Olives for His ascension? It is quite interesting. This involves much of the Scriptures. Firstly, it involves His second coming. Two angels told the disciples, &ldquo;Why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven&rdquo; (Acts 1:11). Zechariah 14:4 tells us that Jesus will come the second time upon the Mount of Olives. So His ascension from this mount has to do with His coming back and His administration in the whole universe. This is not a secret matter, but something official, something governmental. He had to ascend from the Mount of Olives; therefore He asked all His disciples to go from Galilee to Jerusalem to see Him off.</p>
<p>After they should do this, He requested them to tarry in Jerusalem, informing them that something would happen on this earth for His administration, for God&rsquo;s economy, for God&rsquo;s governmental activity. This could never be done in Galilee; it must be done in Jerusalem. We must realize that Peter and all the others were not men of wealth, but poor fishers. How could they afford to go so far and stay so long in addition to being in a situation of threatening and persecution? But that was the price they were called upon to pay.</p>
<p>Concerning the meetings after the resurrection or ascension, we can never discover any sense of lightness. Every meeting was so weighty, quite unlike the meetings of today&rsquo;s Christianity. People say today, &ldquo;Let us go to the eleven o&rsquo;clock Sunday service. We have been working so hard during the week&mdash;Sunday morning is the best time for us to sleep in.&rdquo; What I mean is this: if we take the Lord&rsquo;s way to meet, we must meet at a cost, we must pay a price. I am so happy to tell the universe that here in Los Angeles there are many dear ones who have come from a distance just for the purpose of meeting. So many have settled here and gotten jobs, but their main purpose is not to get settled and find jobs, but to attend the meetings. This is really good. There is a reason why we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence so richly here. So many have really paid the price to attend the meetings. I have full assurance that many migrating from here to spread the church life to other cities will be greatly blessed with the Lord&rsquo;s abundant presence. They are willing to sell their homes, give up their jobs, forget about their future and social welfare, and go at a cost to spread the church life. Praise the Lord!</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we must be here not for our business, not for our schooling, not for our families, but for the meetings. We are the meeting people. We would like to pay any price to keep up the standard of the meeting. We would rather lose our jobs than lose the meetings. Some say that our meetings are too frequent and ask how the mothers can properly care for their children. But I have no word to say. It all depends upon what is more precious and worthwhile in your lives. If the church is more precious than your children, you know what to do. If your children are more precious than the Lord Jesus and His church, you also know what to do. There is no need for me to say anything. If we really mean business for the church, we must realize that the church is in the meeting. To be here for the church means to be here for the meeting. We do not care for the passing things of today; we care for eternity. Hallelujah! We are looking for the eternal consummation.</p>
<p>Our certified public Accountant is in the heavens working out our account for eternity. Whatever we make in this world as a profit means nothing&mdash;eventually that will be a loss. The heavenly, eternal C.P.A. will say, &ldquo;Sorry, your account shows a loss. You feel that you&rsquo;ve done well; you have been making a lot of money, but you lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What are we here for? Look at Jesus and all His disciples. Consider the way they met and how they were willing to pay any price to maintain good meetings. We all have to meet with the resurrected Christ and for the ascended Christ, and we must be willing to pay the price to keep these kinds of meetings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">WITH THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</h1>
<p>In meetings with the resurrected Christ, the main factor is the breathing of the Holy Breath, the life-giving Spirit (John 20:22). In meetings for the ascended Christ, the central matter is the blowing of the mighty rushing wind (Acts 2:2). This means the blowing of the Spirit of power. So in all the meetings with the resurrected Christ, we see Christ breathing Himself into His disciples as the breath of life, the Spirit of life. Then in the meetings for the ascended Christ, we see the empowering, the clothing of the Spirit with power. I feel deeply burdened that we still need to see more concerning the meetings with the resurrected Christ. I believe that the Lord will recover more and more regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Most people have simply become familiar with the stories of these six or seven chapters at the end of the Gospels and the beginning of the book of Acts. But, as we have seen, in all the pages of the Bible there is the life supply. In all these stories of Christ meeting with His disciples after His resurrection we must receive something as a life supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INDIVIDUALLY AND CORPORATELY</h2>
<p>The main point which we must see in all these narratives is that by meeting with His disciples, the resurrected Christ revealed Himself to them. There are two ways He took to meet with His disciples: The first is the individual way. He met with His disciples individually. He met Mary Magdalene, Peter, and James in an individual way. The second was in a corporate way. That means that He had some meetings with a good number of His disciples at once. We are told in 1 Corinthians 15:6 that at one time He met with over five hundred brethren. Of course, we may say that there is still another way. Sometimes He met not just with one person individually, but with several together. Once He met with a few sisters; another time with two brothers as they walked. He met with them individually, in two&rsquo;s or more, and at least five or six times according to the record with them all together. Sometimes He met with the sisters corporately, and sometimes He met with the brothers corporately.</p>
<p>According to the account of the Bible, the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples after His resurrection, either individually or corporately, about eleven or twelve times. It is difficult to come to a definite conclusion regarding this matter, because it is not so clear. But there are at least from eleven to twelve instances. Let me mention them again. In the morning of the resurrection day, the Lord Jesus firstly appeared to one sister alone, Mary Magdalene (John 20:14-18). After that, in the same morning, He appeared to a few sisters together as they went to tell His disciples that He was risen (Matt. 28:8-10; Luke 24:9-10). Thirdly, during the day, the Lord Jesus purposely appeared to Peter (1 Cor. 15:5). Then, in the afternoon, or in the early evening, He appeared to two disciples on their way to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35). The fifth instance of His appearing was that night, when He appeared to all the leading disciples in the room with the doors shut (John 20:19-23). The sixth was the following Lord&rsquo;s day, seven days later&mdash;at that time He appeared again to His leading disciples including Thomas (John 20:24-29). The seventh was His appearance to His disciples on the mountain in Galilee appointed by Him (Matt. 28:16-20). Eighth, He appeared to His disciples on the shore of the Sea of Tiberius (John 21:1-23); ninth, to five hundred people at once (1 Cor. 15:6). The tenth was His appearance to James, individually (1 Cor. 15:7). Number eleven, according to 1 Corinthians 15:7, was to all the Apostles&mdash;it is rather difficult to decide whether this was another separate appearance. Then eventually He appeared to the disciples on the Mount of Olives, when He ascended to the heavens (Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:6-12). According to this enumeration we have twelve instances. But Acts 1:3 tells us that He was &ldquo;seen of them forty days&rdquo;; so this allows for many additional appearances.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS CONTINUAL PRESENCE</h2>
<p>Howbeit, we must learn something here. We should not take these just as stories. Many people no doubt have missed the mark, making the Bible either a story book or a book of teachings. Most people take this account purely as a story, without even deriving much teaching from it. But the Lord&rsquo;s intention is not to tell us some stories. John said that he did not record everything&mdash;if he did, &ldquo;even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.&rdquo; Only certain cases are related to fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s intention. Based upon this principle, we must look at these verses to see not a story, but a portrait revealing something. Here in these few chapters&mdash;Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20 and 21, and Acts 1&mdash;is a full record as a kind of portrait revealing the presence of the resurrected Christ, showing how living He is and how He is with us all the time. If we are alone, He is with us; if we are two or three, He is with us. If you are three sisters together, He is with you; if we are two brothers together, He is with us. If you are one who is seeking and loving Him, He is with you; or if you are one who has failed like Peter, He is also with you. Whether you are strong or weak, He is with you. Whether you are in the room or walking on the road, He is with you. Whether we are on the mountain or by the seashore, He is with us. Whether we understand or do not understand, He is still with us. Whether we are conscious of His presence or not conscious of His presence, the resurrected Christ is with us. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>It is so strange and interesting to see that when we are not conscious of His presence, He is more with us. When those two dear but poor brothers on their way to Emmaus were speaking with Him and even rebuking Him&mdash;&ldquo;You came from Jerusalem, don&rsquo;t you know what&rsquo;s going on there?&rdquo; &mdash;He was so much with them. But once their eyes were opened and they realized it was the Lord, He vanished. Do you think He left them? No, He just disappeared in order to train them, in order to help them realize not only His visible presence, but even more His invisible presence. His visible presence is not so precious as His invisible presence. When you are quite conscious of the Lord&rsquo;s presence sometimes, it is not as good as when you are unconscious of His presence. Can you follow me? Many times we are not conscious of His presence; yet that is the most wonderful time.</p>
<p>By all these stories we realize the wonderful presence of the resurrected and living Christ. Never forget that one verse, &ldquo;Lo, I am with you all the days&rdquo; (Matt. 28:20). He did not say, &ldquo;I have been with you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I was with you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I shall be with you,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Lo, I <em>am</em> with you.&rdquo; He used the present tense. &ldquo;Lo, I am with you all the days.&rdquo; By what way? By any way.</p>
<p>I wish to point out one thing more regarding His appearances. The Lord Jesus is rather &ldquo;sneaky&rdquo;&mdash;may the Lord allow me to use this word. The sisters were told to go and tell the disciples that He would meet them in Galilee. If I were there, I would have said, &ldquo;All right, the Lord Jesus is going to meet us in Galilee. So I will not go to the meeting tonight; He will not appear then. I will do something else.&rdquo; But in the evening of that very day, the Lord Jesus came and joined their meeting! He came not to Galilee, but into a room in Jerusalem. That visit was not appointed by Him; He came without notifying them&mdash;He just came. He did not even knock at the door; He just came in. When they were so frightened and disappointed, yet with some startling reports of His resurrection, He suddenly appeared. If I were Peter, I would say, &ldquo;Lord, You told us that You would meet us in Galilee. Why did You come tonight without any notice?&rdquo; I tell you, the Lord&rsquo;s presence is visible as well as invisible, conscious as well as unconscious. The Lord sometimes notifies us of His presence and more often does not. We just do not know where we will meet Him. Everywhere He meets us. In any case, however, wherever, whenever, He is with us. He is always with us.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE APPEARING</h2>
<p>The Lord appeared to Mary Magdalene first, and in the same day He showed Himself to Peter. Do you know the reason in these two cases? The reason with Mary Magdalene was positive, and the reason with Peter was negative. According to the record of the four Gospels, Mary Magdalene never was backslidden. Ever since she was saved, she followed the Lord continually. She loved the Lord, served the Lord, and was so much for the Lord. On the resurrection morning she was the first at the empty sepulcher, and she was the first to pass on the information. What about Peter? That is another story. Just a short time before, he denied the Lord thrice. Now he heard that Jesus was risen, and he and John came to see the empty sepulcher. Many times I&rsquo;ve told people that we brothers are just so definite: when we behold the fact, we admit the thing. &ldquo;The Lord Jesus is not here; so let us go home.&rdquo; When Peter and John saw the empty sepulcher, they just went away. But Mary Magdalene remained there. Her tarrying was a positive act, a proof of her love for the Lord, and it was through this act of hers that the Lord Jesus revealed Himself to her. You see, the reason the Lord Jesus revealed Himself to Mary was entirely positive. But the reason He revealed Himself to Peter was negative, for Peter had backslidden. We do not have the record of what the Lord Jesus said to Peter nor what Peter said to the Lord Jesus. I am glad of that.</p>
<p>Many times we have this experience: the Lord visits us, not for some positive reason, but, unhappily, for a negative one. He comes to us sometimes, but to us it is a shame. I have learned of some actual incidents: some of the brothers have gone to a movie, and while they were coming home, on the way the Lord Jesus revealed Himself to them. You know what I mean. &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; He says. What would you say? Would you say, &ldquo;Lord, I went to the movie&rdquo;? Sometimes, immediately after you lose your temper with your wife, the Lord Jesus comes to you. Many times He visits us not for some positive reason, but for a negative one. We have backslidden, we have denied Him, we have failed Him in many things. When He reveals Himself to us in this way, we are covered with shame. On that resurrection day He not only appeared to the positive Mary, but also to the negative Peter. When we take into account all the record of Jesus meeting with His disciples after His resurrection, we see that this living Christ is with His disciples anywhere, anytime, regardless of the situation. Whether you are positive or negative, whether you have had a victory or a failure, He is always there. He not only appeared to Mary, but also to Peter. He not only appeared to the positive one, but also to the negative one. What a Lord!</p>
<h2 class="head1">REALIZING THE PRESENCE OF THE LIVING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The proper way for us to meet is to realize that Christ today is so living. Let me check with you: Do you really believe that the Lord Jesus is on this earth today? Do you really realize that the Lord Jesus today is so living within you? You see, if we would have a proper meeting, a living meeting, it must not be something religious, not something of teaching or of keeping certain forms and rituals. The proper meeting of Christians is just to meet with the resurrected Christ who is so living within us. So we need the practical, daily experiences of such a living One. Do we really believe that the Lord Jesus is the resurrected One? Do we really experience the resurrected Christ living within us? Hallelujah! Whether I am victorious or defeated, whether I am a success or a failure, whether I am positive or negative, He is with me! Whether I am conscious of His presence or not, it does not matter&mdash;He is within me!</p>
<p>Acts 1:3 says that before His ascension Christ was seen of His disciples forty days. Do you know what the meaning of forty is in the Bible? It means the period of a full test. The people of Israel were tested in the wilderness for forty years, the Lord Jesus was tempted in the wilderness for forty days, Moses stayed on the mountain for forty days&mdash;there are many forty&rsquo;s in the Bible. Forty means fully tested, fully approved. This means that Christ&rsquo;s living and being present after His resurrection was fully tested and fully approved. He was seen by His disciples, not for one or two days, or even ten days, but forty days. His presence with His disciples was tested and approved for forty days.</p>
<p>The way to have a proper meeting is to realize such a present, living Christ. He is just so present; He is just so living. After His resurrection He became such an omnipresent One. Whether you are on the street or in the room, whether you are on the mountain or at the seashore, whether you are prepared for His presence or not prepared for His presence, He is there. He is always with you. If you are by yourself, He is with you. If you are with another, He is also with you. If we are in the meetings, He is with us.</p>
<p>So many of us have been in Christianity, attending services over a long period of time. Let me ask you, at those services did you have much realization of the Lord&rsquo;s presence? We always went to those so-called Christian services in a religious way. But do we come to the church meeting in this way? Surely not! We must come to the church meeting with the realization that all the day the Lord Jesus has been with us. Regardless of whether we have failed Him or not, He has been with us. In fact, even after our failure, He is more with us. We should come to the meeting with the living Jesus, the resurrected Christ. If so, be assured we will have some living meetings.</p>
<p>If you come to the meeting in such a way, could you keep yourself so silent? Could you sit there waiting, watching, observing, expecting? You may answer, &ldquo;No, I would function.&rdquo; But when we say that we would &ldquo;function,&rdquo; we must be careful. We may use this word in a merely formal way, meaning that we must do something in the meetings. Strictly speaking, it does not mean that we should do anything in the meeting. It means that we have something of Christ, so living, so present and so bubbling up within us. I do not sense that I am functioning, but that I am overflowing with Jesus. It is so living, so spontaneous. There is nothing timed, nothing as a form to keep, nothing as a rule to follow.</p>
<p>Of the twelve instances, according to our reckoning, of the Lord Jesus appearing to His disciples, five of them were to individuals and seven to the corporate body. If we examine the situation of His meeting with the individuals, we will realize that these meetings were with the purpose of bringing those individuals into the corporate meeting. Firstly, He did not meet with all the disciples together, but with individual believers. In the morning He met Mary; then in the morning again He met those few sisters. During the day He met Peter, and in the afternoon He met the two brothers. Then in the evening He came to meet with them all together. The last appearance was not to an individual, but to the entire body of His disciples. All the personal, individual contacts were for the meeting. The meeting was the goal.</p>
<p>Christ today is the resurrected Christ, the living One. This living Christ is so present with us, regardless of the situation. We have been taught that if we are right with the Lord, He is with us, and if we are wrong, He is not with us. But we have seen that regardless of the situation, He is with us all the time. He is present with us that we may come to the meetings, not to keep the forms, the rules or to learn the teachings, but to meet with the resurrected Christ. We have to come to the meeting to tell how we have met with the Lord and how He has met with us during the day. The Lord is recovering something on this earth which is absolutely different from Christianity and any religion. He is recovering a people who realize that Christ is the resurrected One, that He is so living, so present, and so available to them all the time. We should come together not to have a religious worship, not to learn anything of Christianity, not to perform any duty or keep any form, but just to tell people how we have been meeting with the Lord Jesus today. He is so living and present to us all day long that we cannot contain Him, we must share Him with all the people. If we come to the meetings like this, our meetings will be revolutionized.</p>
<p>We have the full assurance that the Lord is going to renew everything. Forget about the old Christianity, forget about the old teachings. Even these stories are not old stories to us; they are altogether new. Bring all these verses to the Lord in a new way. Do not consider that you became familiar with these stories when you were in Sunday School. Forget that. Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20 and 21, and Acts 1 are so new to us. The Lord is recovering something more of the proper meeting life from these chapters.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FOR THE ASCENDED CHRIST</h1>
<p>We have seen that the meetings which the early disciples had with the Lord Jesus can be classified into two kinds: meetings with the resurrected Christ and meetings for the ascended Christ. According to the record of the last chapters of the Gospels and the first chapters of Acts, we can only have these two kinds of meetings&mdash;there could not be a third. It is quite interesting, as we have seen, that of the four Evangelists, two are for the resurrected Christ and two for the ascended Christ. John tells us that He is our life; so He could never leave us. Matthew tells us that He is Emmanuel, God with us; so Matthew also tells us, &ldquo;Lo, I am with you all the days, even unto the completion of the age.&rdquo; Therefore, these two Gospels emphasize the resurrected Christ, the One who is always with us. But Mark and Luke, including the Acts, testify that this resurrected Christ has ascended to the heavens. The meetings for the ascended Christ are not recorded by Matthew nor John, but by Mark and Luke.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING FOR ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>What is the difference between meeting with the resurrected Christ and for the ascended Christ? There is a big difference. We meet with the resurrected Christ mainly for our enjoyment. Our meeting with the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is mainly for breathing Him in, that we may partake of something of Him. Consider all the meetings the disciples had with the resurrected Christ: the main thing in all those meetings was the breathing and the eating. On the evening of the first Lord&rsquo;s day the resurrected Christ came and breathed upon them (John 20:22). Then at the Sea of Tiberias He asked them: &ldquo;Children, have ye any meat?&rdquo; And He said, &ldquo;Come and dine&rdquo; (John 21:5, 12, 15). By breathing and eating, we enjoy the Lord. We meet with the resurrected Christ, the present Christ, for our enjoyment of Him. This Jesus, so near to us, so present and available, is for our enjoyment. He is not for our education, not for our being taught, but for our enjoyment by breathing and eating. Of course, this is something which is entirely missed by Christianity. However, I have full assurance that the Lord will recover this and that He has begun the recovery already. Praise the Lord that some are already learning how to meet with the resurrected Christ for their enjoyment. If we are not learning this, our meetings are meaningless and to no avail. We all must learn how to breathe Him in and feed upon Him for our satisfaction. Sooner or later, the Lord will make this so clear to all the local churches. We will forget about the old way of meeting&mdash;no more mere teaching and ministry, just breathing and eating and enjoying Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Now we need to see more regarding the meetings for the ascended Christ. To meet together is not just a matter of enjoying Christ, but also a matter of functioning that the church may be built up. To meet with the resurrected Christ is for our enjoyment, but to meet for the ascended Christ is for the building up of the church. For the building up of the church we need to function, and to function we need the gifts. On the Day of Pentecost three thousand were added to the church. A little later five thousand more were added. All these were brought in by meetings for the ascended Christ. To build up the church we need to bring new ones in and build others up one with another. All this requires the function, the gifts. And we have been clearly told that all the gifts have been given, not by the resurrected Christ, but by the ascended Christ. &ldquo;Wherefore He saith, When He ascended up on high He led a train of vanquished foes, and gave gifts unto men&rdquo; (Eph. 4:8). By His ascension He has received the gifts, and He has given the gifts to His church for the building up of the Body.</p>
<p>Here we must go a little slowly that we may be more clear. If the Lord Jesus was only resurrected, we could have full satisfaction with Him, but the church could never be built up. In the meetings recorded in Matthew and John, there was the breathing, the eating, and the full satisfaction, but it was rather difficult for the church to be built up. In fact, without the ascension of Christ, it is impossible. Not one of the disciples including Peter had received any gift. Not one of them had any function and could perfect others. They came together to breathe in the Lord and to feed on Him, but that was all they could do. Why did they not have the gifts? Because even Christ had not yet received the gifts. As far as life is concerned, resurrection is sufficient, but as far as gifts are concerned, resurrection is not sufficient. Resurrection is for life, but the ascension is for the gifts. All the believers received resurrection life by and with Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, but none obtained any gifts until the Lord ascended on high and poured down the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:33). It is so clear. Meeting with the resurrected Christ is for our personal breathing, eating and satisfaction, but for the perfecting of the saints, for the building up of the Body, we need to meet for the ascended Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING FOR THE ASCENDED CHRIST IN FAITH</h2>
<p>Here in Los Angeles we have many meetings with the resurrected Christ, but on some occasions we also have meetings for the ascended Christ. Now we need to be exercised more that we may learn not only to meet with the resurrected Christ, but even more for the ascended Christ. To meet with the resurrected Christ is easy: we can on such an occasion have a sense of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. It is not difficult to obtain some feeling of the presence of the resurrected Christ. However, when meeting for the ascended Christ, it is frequently very difficult to obtain any feeling. We all can testify that many times we do sense the presence of the resurrected Christ, but we do not have the sense that we are in the heavens with the ascended Christ. This requires living faith. To meet with the resurrected Christ we may have the feeling, but to meet for the ascended Christ we need not the feeling, but the faith. We can feel something of the resurrected Christ, because He is here; but how can we feel something of the ascended Christ? How can we feel something which is in the heavens while we are here on this earth? You see, this must be by faith. We all need to exercise our faith to meet for the ascended Christ.</p>
<p>Today in Christianity this matter of the ascended Christ has been made a matter of feeling. Some will tell you that you must pray and fast for three days and three nights, and then something great will fall upon you, giving you a certain kind of feeling. So many dear Christians single out the cases of the Samaritans in Acts 8 and the Ephesians in Acts 19 to show that when we are saved we should have a wonderful experience and speak in tongues. But we must never forget the principle of the first mention. The first group of people who were saved as recorded in the book of Acts were the three thousand on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:41). Concerning these, there is the record in Acts chapter two, covering a number of good points, but not saying a word regarding their speaking in tongues. But do you not believe they had the filling of the Spirit? Surely they did.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CLAIMING THE BAPTISM IN FAITH</h2>
<p>This matter of the baptism of the Holy Spirit was once for all accomplished on the day of Pentecost. It is not for any individual believer as such, but has been accomplished for the Body of Christ, the church, and is given absolutely to the church. Now, since we have all been baptized into the church, the Body, we have the position to believe that what was accomplished for the church on the day of Pentecost is for us. Therefore we may claim it, take it and apply it by living faith. Though we may feel nothing, we may boldly take by living faith what has already been accomplished.</p>
<p>Let me tell you some real stories. You cannot deny the stories&mdash;they are history, they are facts. For instance, I learned of some actual incidents of the saints suffering persecution during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 in China. At that time many Chinese Christians were slaughtered. Most of those Christians had not received much teaching; they only knew how to believe in the Lord Jesus, the living One, and how to call upon His name. They knew little concerning the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but when they were persecuted and martyred, they were wonderfully empowered with the Holy Spirit. I met one brother in the Lord who eventually became a full-time preacher for the Lord Jesus. He told me that in 1900, when he was a young man, he was an apprentice at a market in the old capital of Peking. One day, due to the Boxers&rsquo; persecution and execution of the Christians, the market was closed, but he was within. Suddenly, he told me, the street without was filled with tumult and shouting. He peered through the crack in the entrance and saw the Boxers, swords drawn, leading a young girl, not over twenty-five years of age, to her execution. Do you know what this girl was doing? She was full of joy, singing and praising the Lord. Though she was being led to her death, she went fearlessly and joyfully. Though she was in the midst of hateful, threatening, murdering Boxers, she could sing and praise. When this young man saw this, he said to himself, &ldquo;I must contact some Christians to learn their secret.&rdquo; He did, and he was saved.</p>
<p>Tell me, what kind of experience did that girl have? That was the real filling of the Holy Spirit. That was the real experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah! We can tell the Lord&rsquo;s people that the baptism in the Holy Spirit has already been accomplished upon the church, the Body of Christ. It is ours; we can apply it by faith. What will be the outcome? What will be the issue? That is His business.</p>
<p>Now, whenever we come together, if we must function for the building up of the Body&mdash;this means for the ascended Christ&mdash;you and I must immediately exercise our faith. We are the Body of Christ, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit is upon the Body. We can claim the baptism and act upon it by living faith to function in the meetings for the building up of the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT AND FAITH</h2>
<p>Why do we say we must be outside of religion? Why do we say that we need to abandon all forms? Simply because religion and forms bind and kill us. We need just to be in the spirit and exercise our faith to realize the ascended Christ. Oh, we need to be wild for this Christ! We need to be fully released&mdash;not so much in the exercise of our physical bodies, but in the exercise of our spirit, the exercise of our faith.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate. We had a co-worker, a sister, six or seven years older than I, through whose preaching I was saved. In 1925, when she was twenty-five years of age, I heard her preach for the first time. She was but a young girl, yet I can testify that in my entire life I have never seen preaching so prevailing as hers. She was a young lady who naturally was shy, but many times in a situation which required something to be said for the Lord, she immediately forgot herself; she did not exercise her body much, but she exercised her spirit and her faith mightily. She spoke with full assurance that she was speaking from the heavens. People trembled before her. She did not jump, she did not exercise her body, but she exercised her spirit and her faith with boldness. She was not bound by any kind of religion, form or teaching&mdash;she was absolutely out of these things. She was more than one hundred percent in the spirit, exercising her faith to speak. I tell you, that kind of exercising of the spirit and faith not only frightened the people, but frightened the demons.</p>
<p>Let me give you another illustration. That young sister whom we described being led to her execution was instructed by the Boxers to be quiet, but the more they commanded her to be still, the louder she sang. To be wild in that way is really meaningful for Christ. She said in effect, &ldquo;You persecutors tell me to be quiet, but I will not be quiet; I will say something for Jesus! I will never be bound by you; I will be wild for Christ!&rdquo; Again, that kind of exercise and boldness shakes both men and demons.</p>
<p>We need to be fully released and bold to speak and sometimes shout for the ascended Christ, but we must do it in the spirit meaningfully and discernibly. If I realize that it is time for me to speak for Jesus, I will do it from the spirit, boldly and with living faith. This kind of speaking is powerful, full of impact, and with heavenly authority. We do not need any forms, and we need not keep any regulations; yet we must be in the spirit, exercising our faith to believe that we are in the heavens. Suppose we are going to have a Gospel preaching meeting on the coming Sunday morning. Then it is a matter for everyone of us, brothers and sisters, old and young, not just to shout, but to be in the spirit, exercising our faith, just as the soldiers on the front line fighting the battle. Everyone must be on the alert; everyone must be in the spirit, believing by living faith that he is joined to the ascended Head. Then when the time comes, we can immediately stand and with a strong spirit speak something from the heavens. This is a kind of meeting for the ascended Christ. We exercise our spirit with our faith to realize what Christ has accomplished by His ascension.</p>
<p>The Lord is not only resurrected, but also ascended. And by His ascension He has received all the gifts and passed them on to all the members of the church. By His ascension all His members have received something. You cannot say that you have not received anything. If you feel this way, you need to exercise faith&mdash;it is not a matter of feeling, but faith. And according to the principle in Ephesians 4, the gifts given by the ascended Christ are for building up the Body, for perfecting the saints, and for bringing in new believers.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, let us forget all the things we have learned in the past and simply learn to have these two kinds of meetings. Let us come together with Christ to breathe Him in and feed upon Him. Then at the same time, whenever there is the need of bringing in the new converts, perfecting the saints, and building up the Body, we must all realize that our Lord has ascended and that He has poured down all the gifts with all the functions. We must simply exercise our faith and apply it. We not only need to realize the presence of the resurrected Christ, but also the power, the authority, the headship, and the lordship of the ascended Christ. This requires the exercise of living faith in our spirit. I trust that in the coming meetings we will take the opportunity to be bold and even wild, not physically, but spiritually, to release something of Christ and for Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">IN THE LORD&rsquo;S NAME</h1>
<p>We have seen that the first mention of the meeting of believers in the New Testament is in Matthew 18:20. The Lord Jesus told us here that where two or three are gathered together in His name, there He will be in the midst. It seems that most Christians know this. Many Christians today say they are meeting in the name of the Lord Jesus, but what does this mean? What does it mean practically? What does it mean actually? What is the reality of meeting in the name of the Lord Jesus? We Christians are familiar with so many Biblical terms, but when we are checked as to the real meaning of these terms, we cannot answer. We know the terms by reading the Bible, by reading so many scriptural and spiritual books, and by listening to so many messages, but if we are asked to define these terms, we cannot. If you asked me what it means to meet in the name of the Lord Jesus twenty-five years ago, I would have to answer, I do not know, I cannot tell.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REALITY OF MEETING IN THE NAME&mdash;<br />
IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>There is a principle concerning all the revelations in the Bible: firstly we have the seed of that revelation, then the growth, and then the harvest. The revelation concerning the truth of Christian meetings has its seed in Matthew 18:20. This is the seed&mdash;to meet in the name of the Lord Jesus. But what does this mean? We cannot find the answer in the four Gospels; we must go on to the book of Acts.</p>
<p>In the book of Acts we see two vital matters. One is the name. When Peter on the day of Pentecost addressed the people, he told them they must be baptized in the name of Jesus. If they would be baptized in His name, they would receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). So, the name of the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit are the two matters that we see brought together in the book of Acts. If we go on to chapter nineteen of this book, we find a handful of believers meeting in the city of Ephesus. They had not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, and Paul instructed them to be baptized in His name. When they were, they received the Holy Spirit. The name and the Spirit go together in this book time after time.</p>
<p>Now we will pass from the book of Acts to the Epistles. In all the Epistles we cannot find a verse telling us that we must meet in the name of the Lord Jesus, because to meet in His name is but the seed of meeting. In the book of Acts we have the growth of meeting, and in the Epistles we have the harvest. First Corinthians 14 is almost the only chapter in all the Epistles dealing with the way for Christians to meet. What is stressed in this chapter is not the name, but the Spirit. Concerning the truth of Christian meetings, to be in the name of the Lord Jesus is the seed, to be in the name of the Lord to receive the Holy Spirit is the growth, and to be in the Spirit is the harvest. Thus we see that <em>the name of the Lord Jesus is very much linked with the Holy Spirit.</em> Without the Holy Spirit, there is no reality of the name of the Lord Jesus. We say that the name of Jesus is powerful. But what is the power of the name of Jesus? The Holy Spirit. All the power and reality of the name of Jesus is <em>in</em> the Holy Spirit and <em>is</em> the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Now let us see a few more verses which prove that the Holy Spirit is vitally related to the name of Jesus. John 14:13-17 says, &ldquo;And whatsoever ye shall ask in <em>my name,</em> that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in <em>my name,</em> I will do it. If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; even <em>the Spirit of reality</em>; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.&rdquo; By reading these verses together, we obtain the context of all these words, and we see that the reality of the Lord&rsquo;s name is in the Spirit and is the Spirit. The Lord Jesus for the first time told us to ask for something in His name. Following this, He told us that for this purpose He would ask the Father to give us the Spirit. Without the Spirit, we could never ask in the name of the Lord Jesus. Thus, the reality of the Lord&rsquo;s name is the Spirit. The reality of anyone&rsquo;s name is his person. The Person of the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is just the Lord Himself (2 Cor. 3:17). He Himself is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). So, the Holy Spirit, as the Person of the Lord, is the reality of the Lord&rsquo;s name. Therefore, to meet in the name of the Lord means to meet in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In the Gospels we have the matter of meeting in the name, but in the Epistles it seems that the Apostles forgot all about the name. But no, they did not forget. They knew, but they were in the harvest, they were in the Spirit, the reality of the name. Therefore, in the Epistles the Apostles tell us that we must meet in the Spirit. Between the Gospels and the Epistles we have the book of Acts. In the Acts we see how this matter has progressed from the seed to the harvest; therefore, the name and the Spirit are brought together.</p>
<p>Now let us read John 14, verse 26: &ldquo;But the Comforter, which is <em>the Holy Spirit,</em> whom the Father will send in <em>my name...</em>&rdquo; The Lord tells us here that the Holy Spirit will be sent in His name. What does this mean? Suppose I promise to give you some money, but eventually I just give you a check. You will realize, of course, that this check is the reality of the money I promised you. The Lord Jesus promised to give us something in His name, and what He gave us was the Spirit. The Spirit is the reality of His name. He did not say that He would leave His name with us, a name just in word, just as a term. If so, there would be no reality, no power. Jesus is an English word with five letters. Are these five letters powerful? No. Then what is the power of Jesus&rsquo; name? <em>The Spirit.</em> If you do not touch the Spirit, you can never touch the power of His name. If you are not in the Spirit, you are not in His name, you are not in the reality of the Lord Jesus. This is why, when we come to the harvest of the truth in the Epistles, we come to the Spirit. There is no need to speak about the name, because this is not the stage of the seed, but the stage of the harvest. Now we have the Spirit; so we meet in the Spirit. When you put my check in the bank, immediately you get the money.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 12:3 we read, &ldquo;No man can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (literal Greek translation). When you say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; then you are in the Spirit. When you call on the name of Jesus, you are in the Spirit. You call &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; and you get the Spirit, because the Holy Spirit is the reality of Jesus. If you called, &ldquo;John,&rdquo; you would not get me, because I am not John. John and I are not one, and I am not the reality of John. But now the Holy Spirit is the reality of Jesus; so whenever you call &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; Hallelujah, you get the Spirit. Do you see? The reality of meeting in the name of the Lord Jesus is meeting in the Spirit. The name is just the seed in the earth, but now we have the harvest because we have the Spirit. We must all realize that the real meaning of meeting in the name of the Lord Jesus is to meet in the Spirit. When we are in the Spirit, we are in the name. In 1 Corinthians 14 the Apostle Paul said not a word about the name, but just the Spirit, because the Holy Spirit is the very reality, power and essence of the name of Jesus. We must be in the Holy Spirit in order to be in the name of Christ. This is quite clear.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now let me ask another question. Where is the Spirit today? Hallelujah! The reality of the name is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit today is in our spirit. This is why we must exercise our spirit. It is very difficult to say whether the word &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; in 1 Corinthians chapters twelve and fourteen refers to something of the Holy Spirit or our regenerated human spirit. The King James Version, in 1 Corinthians 12:1, says, &ldquo;Now concerning spiritual gifts,&rdquo; and in 14:1, &ldquo;Follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;gifts,&rdquo; if you noticed, is in italics; it means that it is not in the original text; in the Greek there is not such a word. In other words, it just says, &ldquo;Now concerning spiritual,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Follow after charity, and desire spiritual...&rdquo; Of course, there is no need that the Holy Spirit be spiritual. Those who need to be spiritual are you and I. The word &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; refers to us; we must learn to be spiritual. I do believe it really means that we must be in the spirit. It is rather difficult for anyone to decide whether the &ldquo;s&rdquo; of this spirit should be capitalized or not. We could translate 1 Corinthians 12:1 in such a way: &ldquo;Now concerning being in the spirit, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.&rdquo; Chapter fourteen, verse 1, likewise, can be translated as, &ldquo;Follow after love, and desire to be in the spirit.&rdquo; I prefer not to capitalize the word &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in these verses. If you read chapter fourteen, you will see how many times the word &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; has been used with small letter &ldquo;s.&rdquo; Eventually when you come to verse 32, you read concerning &ldquo;the spirits of the prophets,&rdquo; the &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; being in plural number because the prophets are in plural number, and the spirits are the spirits of the prophets. It is exceedingly easy for anyone to see that this does not refer to the Holy Spirit, but to the human spirits of the prophets.</p>
<p>Now, I believe, you have the secret of how to meet. Firstly, it is to meet in the name. Secondly, to meet in the name means to meet in the Spirit. And thirdly, to meet in the Spirit means to exercise our spirit. This is the way for us to attend the meetings. The way for Christians to meet is not to have forms, regulations, programs, and so forth, but just to exercise the spirit. The Holy Spirit is mingled with our spirit; therefore, when we exercise our spirit the Holy Spirit moves with us. When the Holy Spirit moves with our spirit, we have the reality of the name. We are meeting not only by exercising our spirit, but also by being in the Spirit, and thus also in the name.</p>
<p>The key, the secret of our meeting together, is the exercise of our regenerated human spirit. How can we prove this? First Corinthians 14:32 is the strongest proof. Verse 31 tells us that we all &ldquo;can prophesy&rdquo; (Greek). Then verse 32 follows by telling us that prophesying is just the exercise of our spirit. It is not to wait until the Spirit pushes us, because the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. As the prophet, if we do not take the initiative, if our spirit would not move, then the Holy Spirit has no way out. We must take the initiative and exercise our spirit. If our spirit moves, the Holy Spirit who is within our spirit will move with us and bring in the reality of the name of Jesus. Therefore, the proper way for us as Christians to meet is to exercise our spirit. This is no small thing.</p>
<p>You do not know how much time we have spent searching the Bible, especially the New Testament, and reading many other writings to discover the way of meeting. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, He showed us that the secret of meeting together is to exercise the spirit, because the reality of the name of the Lord is in the Spirit, and His Spirit is mingled with our spirit. The secret of our meeting today is the exercise of our spirit.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s Christianity there is much talk about the Spirit in meetings. The so-called Pentecostal people say that we must have the manifestation of the Holy Spirit in the meeting. That means, according to their teaching, that we must pray, that we must confess our sins, that we must tarry and pray with fasting for a certain time, and then suddenly in one of the meetings the Holy Spirit will descend upon us and we will have the manifestation of speaking in tongues. With them, it is quite difficult. I was in this kind of movement for some time more than thirty years ago. I spent much time praying, fasting, confessing all my sins, and so forth. I am not criticizing, but just presenting the real situation of today&rsquo;s Christianity.</p>
<p>Then there is the other extreme. In so-called fundamental Christianity we are told that we must follow the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. In all the meetings we must wait and not act if we do not have inspiration. If you read all the fundamental writings regarding the inspiration of the Spirit in meetings, they all say the same thing. You must confess your sins and consecrate yourself, you must pray more, you must wait more upon the Lord; then you will feel the Holy Spirit inspiring you and you need only follow His inspiration. Let me check with you: Can you find such a verse in the Bible? Is there a verse telling us that we must meet in this way? No, there is not.</p>
<p>Read 1 Corinthians chapters twelve and fourteen: you will see that we must desire to be in the spirit; we must desire to prophesy. To prophesy is not to wait until we are inspired. Read the context. To prophesy means to take the initiative to exercise our spirit. It seems that we take the lead, but when we do, the Spirit of God follows and flows out, because today the Holy Spirit is mingled with our spirit. With Him there is no problem. He is always waiting for us; the problem is with us. If we would just cooperate with Him, if we would take the lead, He would follow and come forth. He would work together with us. It is not a case of us waiting for Him; it is He who is continually waiting for us. Since the time He came into us and mingled Himself with us, He has been waiting for us all the time. He has taken the initiative already; He is waiting now for us.</p>
<p>I do believe that if you read all these passages to which we have referred, and not only read them but pray-read them again and again, your eyes will be opened. Praise the Lord, there is no need for us to wait for any kind of manifestation or any kind of inspiration. We need only to exercise our spirit and open our mouth to say, &ldquo;O Lord, O Lord!&rdquo; Do you see the point? Read the context of all these passages and you will get the proper meaning. Just exercise your spirit and say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Exercise something deeply within you to speak for the Lord Jesus. This is the exercise of the spirit. It seems that it is out from you, but it is really something of God, because the very Spirit of God today is mingled with your spirit.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I participated with the other children in a certain kind of race. We divided into pairs, and two of our feet were bound together so that each pair was forced to run with three feet. I believe that in America it is called a three-legged race. When I ran this race, the other one, my mate, was always waiting for me. Eventually I would rise and get ready to run the race. Now tell me, who was the initiator, he or I? Apparently it was I, but in fact he was the real initiator. Now we are bound together with the Holy Spirit, and not only bound together, but mingled with Him. But we are so slow and slothful; He has been waiting for us all the time. When we become aware of Him, we are still ignorant, for we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I have been waiting for You in my spirit. I have been praying for three days, and I do not have the inspiration.&rdquo; Dear ones have come to me and said, &ldquo;How is it that you have such inspiration, but it is so difficult for us to obtain it? It seems so easy for you to be inspired, but so difficult for us. Why?&rdquo; The answer is that they have been carried away by the fundamental teachings. Read 1 Corinthians chapter fourteen again and again. It does not say that we must wait, it does not say that we must pray, it does not say that we must fast. It says that we must take the initiative; our human spirit must take action. It seems that we are always waiting, but actually the Holy Spirit has been waiting for us all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO EXERCISE OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>By what way, then, can we take the action and initiative in our spirit? Praise the Lord, in these two chapters we have two ways. Just by saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus!&rdquo; &ldquo;No man can say Lord Jesus but in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 12:3). In other words, whenever you say &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; in a real way, it means that you are in the Spirit. Some versions translate 1 Corinthians 12:3 in this way: &ldquo;No one can say Lord Jesus except by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Other versions give this rendering: &ldquo;No one can say Lord Jesus but in the power of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Though such words as inspiration and power in this verse are not in the original Greek, yet this is the real meaning. To be in the Spirit really means to be in the power and inspiration of the Holy Spirit. When you say &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; you are in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. There is no need for you to wait for inspiration; you are already in it. We all have to learn to say &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; in the meeting, in our home, and a thousand times a day. I hope that the sisters while they are shopping in the supermarket will say &ldquo;Lord Jesus&rdquo; many times. While they are walking down the aisles and considering what to buy, they must say &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; We all must say this. If we are going to lose our temper, we must say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Then our temper will be gone. There is no need for us to read so many books to become holy. I tell you, you can become holy just by saying &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Whenever you say &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; you are in the <em>Holy</em> Spirit. It is wonderful.</p>
<p>Then in the meetings, the second way to keep yourself in the Holy Spirit is to prophesy. To be in the Holy Spirit means to prophesy. But we must realize that to prophesy not only means to foretell. Altogether, to prophesy has three meanings: 1) to foretell, meaning to predict or to speak beforehand; 2) to tell for, or to say something on the behalf of others; and 3) to tell forth, or to proclaim and declare. These are the three meanings of this one word &ldquo;prophesy&rdquo; in the New Testament. In Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 14, to prophesy means <em>to tell for</em> more than the other two meanings. It means to say something for Christ, to say something for the Lord&mdash;this is real prophecy. You may not be able to speak in tongues, but you can prophesy; you can say something for the Lord in the meetings. Everyone can. First Corinthians 14:31 says, &ldquo;Ye can all prophesy&rdquo; (Greek). We all can prophesy, we all can say something for Jesus. I tell you the truth, I cannot sing well at all, but I can say so many things for Christ. Sisters, you can say something for the Lord. Praise the Lord, you can prophesy. I can say something all the time for the Lord Jesus. As long as I have breath, I can say something for Him. This is real prophecy. Read 1 Corinthians 14 again and again and see if this is not the meaning.</p>
<p>The way to meet, therefore, is to be in the name of the Lord Jesus. And the way to be in the reality of the name of the Lord Jesus is to be in the Spirit. The way to be in the Spirit is to exercise our spirit, because the Holy Spirit is one with our spirit. And the way to exercise our spirit in the meetings is to call, &ldquo;Lord Jesus!&rdquo; and to prophesy, to speak for Christ the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BY LOVE AND BY PROPHECY</h1>
<p>In the entire New Testament, 1 Corinthians is almost the only book that deals with the matter of Christian meetings. There is nothing mentioned regarding Christian meetings in the book of Romans, and in all the other Epistles there is barely a mention of it. In 1 Corinthians there are sixteen chapters, out of which we have one portion or section which deals with the matter of meetings. This matter is very much related to the exercise of gifts, for when Christians meet together it is time for them to function by using their gifts. Thus, in this section of 1 Corinthians, which is composed of chapters twelve, thirteen and fourteen, Christian meetings are related to the exercise of the gifts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Chapter twelve mentions many things concerning spiritual matters. You may say &ldquo;spiritual gifts,&rdquo; but whatever you say, it means spiritual things. This word &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; is not used first in chapter twelve; its first use in this book is in chapter two. In this chapter we read that the spiritual man, not the soulish man, understands the things of the Spirit (vv. 14-15). Then in chapter three, Paul says that he cannot consider the Corinthians as spiritual men (vv. 1-4). &ldquo;You are not spiritual,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are still carnal [fleshly].&rdquo; We have already pointed out that to be spiritual means to be in the spirit. Likewise, to be carnal means to be in the flesh. When you act in the flesh, you are fleshly, but when you walk and act in the spirit, you are spiritual. A spiritual person is one who lives, works and acts in the spirit. Undoubtedly, when we are in the spirit, there will be a certain kind of manifestation upon us&mdash;the manifestation of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Some Christians say that the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is only ninefold. But if you read through chapter twelve of 1 Corinthians carefully and through the remainder of the New Testament, you will discover that the manifestation of the Spirit is much more than nine. I would ask you to read verse 28 of chapter twelve. In this verse we have helps and governments. But these two items are not included in the manifestation of the Spirit listed in verses 7 through 10. God has set these helps and governments in the church; are they not a further manifestation of the Spirit? Then in Acts chapter two we have the matter of dreams. It says there that the young men shall see visions, and the old men shall dream dreams (v. 17). Are these not also the manifestation of the Spirit? You see, the nine items listed in 12:7-10 are not the only manifestation of the Spirit. People also say the fruit of the Spirit, as listed in Galatians 5:22, 23, is only ninefold. But do you really believe that the fruit of the Holy Spirit is only nine? In Galatians 5:22 there is no humility, no holiness, and no righteousness mentioned. But are these not also the fruit of the Spirit? Yes. Besides these, there are also many more aspects of the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GREATER GIFT AND THE EXCELLENT WAY</h2>
<p>Now let us come back to chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen. At the conclusion of chapter twelve the Apostle says that we should desire earnestly &ldquo;the best gifts.&rdquo; This indicates that some of the gifts mentioned in this chapter are good, but they are not the best. The King James Version does not render this word quite accurately. It should not be &ldquo;covet earnestly the best gifts,&rdquo; but &ldquo;covet earnestly the greater gifts.&rdquo; So we have gifts and greater gifts. Paul said that we should desire the greater gifts.</p>
<p>I believe that many of you have read these three chapters and are familiar with them. Let me ask you: Is healing a greater gift? Is speaking in tongues a greater gift? I believe that fairly speaking you will have to answer, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then, comparatively speaking, which gift is greater? The answer is, the gift that builds up the church. So Paul says, &ldquo;I had rather speak five words with my understanding...than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue&rdquo; that the church may be built up. The greater gift is not speaking in tongues nor healing, but prophesying, for it is prophesying that builds up the church.</p>
<p>Paul told us that we should covet earnestly the greater gifts, yet he said that he would show us an excellent way. So we not only need the gifts, but also the way. You may have the gifts, but you may not have the way. You may be so great in the gifts, but so poor in the way. On one hand Paul said, &ldquo;I encourage you to desire the greater gifts,&rdquo; but on the other hand, &ldquo;I show you now an excellent way.&rdquo; What is the excellent way? Love! &ldquo;Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal&rdquo; (13:1). What are sounding brass and tinkling cymbal? They are sounds without life. If I speak without love, I am a tinkling cymbal; there is the sound, but no life. Then the Apostle goes on to say that prophecy shall fail, tongues shall cease, and knowledge shall vanish away, but love never faileth (13:8), love is the greatest. And in chapter fourteen, verse 1, he gives the conclusion: &ldquo;Pursue love.&rdquo; The King James Version says, &ldquo;Follow after charity,&rdquo; but the better translation is, &ldquo;Pursue love.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pursue love and desire the spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in chapter fourteen, verse 5, the Apostle says, &ldquo;I would that ye all spake with tongues.&rdquo; This proves that not all the Corinthian believers spoke in tongues; otherwise, there would be no need for the Apostle Paul to say such a thing. He says, &ldquo;I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied.&rdquo; To prophesy is a greater gift than to speak in tongues; the Apostle was encouraging them to prophesy. In verse 31 he says, &ldquo;For ye can [Greek] all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; If you take the initiative with your spirit to prophesy, then the Holy Spirit, who is one with your spirit, will cooperate with you. &ldquo;The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets&rdquo; (v. 32). You can give your spirit the order to prophesy; your spirit is subject to you. Then, finally, in verse 39 the Apostle says, &ldquo;Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.&rdquo; The Apostle is so balanced: to speak with tongues is not so great, it is not so important as prophesying, yet we should not forbid it.</p>
<p>Now we have gone rapidly through these three chapters, chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen. The main impression we get from them is that there are two outstanding things we must seek&mdash;love and prophecy. We need to pursue love, and we must seek to prophesy. Forgive me to say a word to you at this time. Forget the impressions you have received in the past. Let us come to the pure Word and read these three chapters again and again. I have read through these three chapters many times, especially in recent days, with the purpose of getting more deeply into them. I have read them with the help of all kinds of versions and translations, with the concordance and with the Greek. Out of it all has come this&mdash;the summary and main thought of the writer in these three chapters is that we must pursue love as the excellent way and seek prophecy as the greater gift. This is all the church needs today. The church needs the love and the prophecy.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, have you realized that both love and prophecy are things of the Spirit and that these are the very things that build up the church? If you read 1 Corinthians, you will see that in this one book there are only two things that build up: the first is love (8:1) and the second is prophecy (14:5). How can the church be built up? By love and by prophecy. What is love? Love is Christ as life in my spirit for my living in my daily walk. In other words, my living is Christ as life expressed in the form of love. And what is prophecy? Prophecy is also Christ in my spirit as a kind of ministry for function in the meetings. In my daily walk I have Christ as life expressed in the form of love, and in the meetings I have Christ as my ministry for my function. We need love for our living and prophecy for our function in the meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELATION OF 1 CORINTHIANS 12&mdash;14<br />
TO THE ENTIRE BOOK</h2>
<p>With the foregoing in mind, I would present to you a full picture of 1 Corinthians. These three chapters that we have been considering, chapters twelve through fourteen, are not an isolated portion but simply a part of the whole message of 1 Corinthians; so we must see them in relationship to the whole. Let us take a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the entire book&mdash;it is vital to our understanding of these three chapters.</p>
<p>In chapter one we are told that we have been called into the fellowship of Christ (v. 9). This means that we have been called by God into the enjoyment of Christ. Then we are told that Christ is God&rsquo;s wisdom and God&rsquo;s power as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (vv. 24, 30). In chapter two we are told that this Christ, as God&rsquo;s wisdom and power, as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, is the deep things of God (vv. 2, 7, 10); and if we are going to realize all these deep things of God, we must be in the spirit, we must be spiritual (vv. 14, 15). Then we go on to chapter six, where we are told that &ldquo;he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (v. 17). We are one spirit with this Christ, who is the power of God, the wisdom of God, and who is also the righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us. We are actually one with Him in spirit. Then in chapter ten we are told that this Christ is our meat, our food and our drink (vv. 3, 4); He is our enjoyment. And finally, in chapter fifteen, we are told that this very Christ has been made a life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>When we put all these points together, we get the full scope of the thought of the Apostle in 1 Corinthians. In the middle of such a book we have this section, chapters twelve through fourteen, dealing with the meetings and the gifts. This reveals to us that if we are going to have the gifts, if we are going to meet in a proper way, we must experience and enjoy the Christ which this book presents; then we will have Him as our life in the spirit in our daily walk. When we come together, then, we need only exercise our spirit to prophesy something of Christ. When we meet together, we can say something of Him whom we have already experienced and enjoyed in our daily living. This is the way for us to meet.</p>
<p>Let us put it in this way. According to the entire context of 1 Corinthians, the proper way for us to meet together is that firstly we must have a daily walk with Christ as our life, with Christ as our enjoyment, with Christ as our everything. Then we will have the very love. Love is the expression of Christ as our life. It includes patience, meekness, endurance, longsuffering, humility; it includes all the virtues of the Christian life. Love is so all-inclusive. Love is simply Christ expressed through us as our living. Love never fails, because love is Christ Himself. Sometimes we must change the word &ldquo;love&rdquo; in chapter thirteen of 1 Corinthians into &ldquo;Christ.&rdquo; &ldquo;Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not Christ, I am become as sounding brass...&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ never fails...Christ is the greatest.&rdquo; He is the excellent way. Praise Him!</p>
<p>We can never stand up to prophesy in the meetings in a proper way if we are not taking Christ as our life in our daily walk. If we are not enjoying Christ as our life day by day, it is impossible to prophesy in the meetings. If we could, I tell you, we are just pretending. Sometimes when I have offended my wife just a little, before I come to the meeting I must apologize and seek her forgiveness; otherwise, it is rather difficult for me to stand up and function in the meeting. Without dealing with the matter, there is a hole in my conscience. On one hand I encourage everyone to prophesy, to function in the meetings, but sometimes you simply cannot do so, because there is not only one hole, but several holes in your conscience. How can an electric light bulb give light if there is a hole in it? If our conscience is not covered by the blood, we have no boldness to rise and prophesy. Sometimes people ask how I can be so bold and strong to speak in the meetings. It is because I have a conscience without offense. This does not mean that I am perfect, but that I am purged and purified by the cleansing blood. Put it to the test. Suppose that today you have told some lies, not big lies, just small ones. Try to stand up and function in the meeting. If you can, you are just pretending. To prophesy in the meetings depends on our living by Christ in our daily walk. We all can prophesy, but to prophesy in the meetings depends on our living by Christ. If we do not take Christ as our life in our daily walk, it is very difficult to prophesy in the meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HABIT OF EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>To live by Christ, to take Christ as our life in our daily walk, is absolutely a matter of being in the spirit. It is the real practice of the exercise of our spirit. Suppose you are quarreling or arguing with your roommate, your dear wife, or your husband. You know that when you persist in arguing you are out of the spirit; you are exercising your mind and your emotions, not your spirit. You may feel that you are definitely right and the other party is wrong, but you are not in the spirit. If you do not live in the spirit and exercise your spirit in your daily walk, how can you possibly exercise your spirit to prophesy when you come to the meeting? If you have been exercising your mind and not your spirit in all your daily living, when you enter the meeting you will do the same thing. You will consider this brother and that brother, you will criticize and analyze this brother and that brother. You will continue to exercise your mind and not your spirit&mdash;this is your habit. You have built up this habit in your daily walk. If we do not exercise our spirit all the day, every day, how can we exercise our spirit to prophesy in the meetings? In our homes, in our family life, on our jobs, we must practice continually the exercise of our spirit. We need to build up the habit of exercising our spirit. I may have many matters with which to quarrel with my wife, but if I turn just a little to the spirit, the spirit will indicate not to quarrel, not to argue. The spirit will tell me, &ldquo;Do not say that you are right, say &lsquo;O Lord!&rsquo;&rdquo; Forget about so many things and just exercise the spirit to say, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; If you do not exercise your spirit to say, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah,&rdquo; in your daily life, it is rather difficult to come to the meeting to say, &ldquo;O Lord.&rdquo; If you can do it in the meeting without doing it in your daily life, you must be an actor or actress, and you make the meeting place a theater with some kind of performance.</p>
<p><em>The way we meet depends on the way we live.</em> How should we meet? We must live in a proper way. We must live by taking Christ as our life, a life which is always expressed in the form of love. Love suffers, love endures, love forgives. How may we express this love? Just by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord and enjoy Him. Do you think that if you would exercise your spirit all day to say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; you could hate others? Can we banish darkness and hatred by struggling with them and resisting them? The more we do this, the more we will be in darkness and filled with hatred. If we would simply turn to our spirit and say, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah,&rdquo; the Lord would be with us and be expressed in the form of love.</p>
<p>In one translation of chapter thirteen we have this word, &ldquo;Love never reckons others&rsquo; faults.&rdquo; This is love. Love covers, love never reckons, love endures, love suffers, love believes and hopes all things. What is this love? It is nothing less than Christ in my practical, daily life. If we would enjoy such a Christ as our love, we need to exercise our spirit, not our mind. If we do not exercise our spirit, sooner or later we will always reckon the faults and failures of the brothers. Exercise your spirit continually and you will enjoy Christ and experience Him; then when you come to the meeting, out of your habit of exercising your spirit, you will have the boldness to stand up and prophesy something of Christ. You will be able to say, &ldquo;I do not care for anything but the spirit. O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; This is your habit. This is my habit. It is wonderful! With such a habit it is easy to prophesy, it is easy to say something about the Lord and for the Lord in the meetings. This is the way to meet; this is the way revealed to us through the book of 1 Corinthians.</p>
<p>Christ is our portion, Christ is everything to us, Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and we are joined unto Him in one spirit. It is by this way that we can live in Him, walk in Him, and have our being in Him. Then when we come together, as in chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen of 1 Corinthians, we gather with such a background, we come together with such a standing, with such a daily life, with such an exercise of the spirit. Then we need only take the initiative in the spirit to prophesy, to say something of and for the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Is this my teaching? No! This is the revelation of God in the Bible. It was buried, it was covered for centuries, but by His mercy it has been discovered. This book of 1 Corinthians is so open to us today. It is transparent from the first chapter to the last. Christ is so much to us that we may live by Him in a practical way day by day. Then when we meet together, out of such an experience of Christ, it is easy for us to exercise our spirit to share something of Him. We are no longer dumb, but bold to speak for the Lord Jesus. This is the way for us to meet.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">WITH A PROPER LIFE IN SPIRIT</h1>
<p>When we consider the matter of meetings, it is very difficult to depart from the book of 1 Corinthians. Just in this one book meeting together is mentioned at least eight times. Chapter five, verse 4, speaks about coming together; chapter eleven refers five times (vv. 17, 18, 20, 33, 34) to coming together or meeting together; and chapter fourteen mentions this matter twice (vv. 23, 26). First Corinthians is not just a book which deals with gifts, but a book which deals with meetings. In fact, if you read the context of this book, you will see that the Apostle Paul deals with gifts just because he is dealing with the meetings. Gifts are not the main point; the meetings are. The gifts are for the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEMONSTRATING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now I would ask you to look at some verses from this book that you might obtain a proper understanding of the overall thought and intention of the author. Let us start with chapter two, verse 2: The Apostle Paul said when he came to the Corinthians that he &ldquo;determined not to know anything...save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.&rdquo; Then in 2:4, &ldquo;And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man&rsquo;s wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power.&rdquo; The King James Version capitalizes the word &ldquo;Spirit,&rdquo; but if you look into the Greek-English interlinear rendering of the Nestles text, you will see that it should be just &ldquo;in demonstration of spirit.&rdquo; This is the better rendering. The spirit to which the Apostle Paul is referring is not the Holy Spirit, but his human spirit. He came to Corinth to demonstrate his spirit. This is a most striking statement of Paul&rsquo;s. He said in effect, &ldquo;I was not speaking among you with enticing words from my mind, I was speaking among you with my spirit; my speaking was a demonstration of my spirit.&rdquo; Suppose a philosopher with a PhD degree was speaking among us here. Immediately you could sense the mind of this man coming forth. But suppose that we had the Apostle Paul here with us. I do believe you would sense that his spirit was so strong. The more he would speak, the more his spirit would come forth. His speech would be a demonstration of spirit and of power.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STRONG IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now let us look at 4:21, &ldquo;What will ye? Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?&rdquo; It is indeed good that the King James Version does not render the word &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; here with a capital letter &lsquo;S.&rsquo; The Apostle Paul did not ask, &ldquo;Would you like me to come to you with love and a clear mind?&rdquo; No, but &ldquo;with love and a meek spirit, a spirit of meekness.&rdquo; We must realize that the Apostle undoubtedly was one who was always in the spirit&mdash;I do not mean in the Holy Spirit, but in his regenerated, human spirit.</p>
<p>Now let us go on to chapter five. Have you ever been impressed with verses 3 and 4 of this chapter? These verses reveal to us how much the Apostle Paul was in the spirit. &ldquo;For I verily, as absent in body, but present <em>in spirit,</em> have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and <em>my spirit,</em> with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ...&rdquo; It is quite interesting: when Paul was away, he still attended the meeting at Corinth! How? His spirit was there. Look into the translation of the Nestles text: it renders it in this way, &ldquo;You and my spirit are assembled with the power of our Lord Jesus to deliver such a person to Satan.&rdquo; You see, while Paul was away, while he was absent from them, he did two things: 1) he attended their meeting; and 2) he delivered to Satan the sinful one, whom the church would not deliver. Paul did these two things in his spirit. He did not say, &ldquo;Brethren, you must realize that I am so concerned for you. I remember you all the time before the throne of God.&rdquo; No, he said that when they came together, he was with them, in his spirit. He said when you come together, my spirit comes with you, and at that time I do something which you would not do. He must have been so strong in his spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE WITH THE LORD IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now let us go on to chapter seven. I am so happy that we have such a chapter as this in the Bible. Let us firstly read verse 10: &ldquo;And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord.&rdquo; What does this mean? Is this the Apostle Paul commanding or is it the Lord? The meaning is this: when I command, the Lord commands with me; the Lord commands in my commanding. Do you think that if Paul commanded by the exercise of his mind or emotion he could say, &ldquo;Yet not I, but the Lord&rdquo;? It must be that he commanded in the spirit. &ldquo;He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; He was one with the Lord in his spirit; so when he commanded in his spirit, he could say &ldquo;yet not I, but the Lord.&rdquo; When I command in my spirit, the Lord commands with me, for I am one spirit with the Lord.</p>
<p>Now let us read verse 12: &ldquo;But to the rest speak I, not the Lord.&rdquo; If I were there, I would say, &ldquo;Brother Paul, if it is not the Lord that is speaking, you should not speak.&rdquo; But Paul said clearly and definitely, &ldquo;I speak, not the Lord.&rdquo; Would you dare to say this? Would you dare to say, &ldquo;I am going to speak something to you, not the Lord.&rdquo; Paul makes it clear that the word he is about to speak is not spoken by the Lord, but by himself. But I would ask you, do you take the word which he goes on to speak as of Paul or as of the Lord? I believe you take that word as of the Lord, and I do too.</p>
<p>But let us go on to verse 25. &ldquo;Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment.&rdquo; Paul had no commandment of the Lord, yet he gave his opinion (&ldquo;judgment&rdquo; here means opinion) &ldquo;as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.&rdquo; He was saying in effect, &ldquo;I do not have the commandment of the Lord, but I have an opinion as one who has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. So within my opinion, there must be something of the Lord&rsquo;s opinion. I have no commandment from the Lord, but I am one with the Lord; so whatever my opinion is must be the Lord&rsquo;s opinion too.&rdquo; If this one chapter was not in the Bible, and what we are saying here was something of our speaking, all Christianity would rise up and accuse us of heresy. They would say, &ldquo;If you do not have the commandment of the Lord, you must wait till you have the inspiration.&rdquo; This is the way of today&rsquo;s Christianity. But here is a man who tells us clearly that he does not have the commandment of the Lord, yet he speaks. What kind of teaching is this?</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRUE SPIRITUALITY</h2>
<p>Let us go on now to verse 40: &ldquo;But she is happier if she so abide, after my opinion: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God&rdquo; (this is the best rendering of this verse). This means that Paul not only had an opinion, but he also had the Spirit of God. But notice that he said, &ldquo;I <em>think</em> I have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; He did not say that he was certain he had the Spirit of God. If the Apostle Paul were here, I would check with him: &ldquo;Paul, tell me, do you have the Spirit of God or not?&rdquo; The Apostle Paul did prophesy in this chapter, and at the end of this long prophecy of forty verses he says, &ldquo;This is my opinion, and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; Sometimes I would like to hear a brother in the meeting prophesy for fifteen minutes and at the conclusion say, &ldquo;Brothers, this is my opinion, yet I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; That would not be like the Fundamentalists nor the Pentecostals of today&rsquo;s Christianity. The Fundamentalists would say, &ldquo;Now Pastor Smith has a word from the Lord for us.&rdquo; The Pentecostals would say, &ldquo;Yea, thus saith the Lord, O my people...&rdquo; Paul did not speak like this. Too much assurance means that we are not in the Spirit. The more you could say like Paul, &ldquo;This is my opinion, yet I think that I also have the Spirit of God,&rdquo; the more spiritual you are. Suppose that I stand up to speak, and after speaking a brother asks whether or not I am in the Spirit. If I answer, &ldquo;Yes, brother, I am in the Spirit,&rdquo; be assured that I am not in the Spirit. But if I answer, &ldquo;Brother, I dare not say that I am in the Spirit&mdash;I just feel that I must utter something; it may only be my opinion, but I think I have at least a little of the Spirit of God&rdquo;; I tell you, if I could answer in this way, I am a real and spiritual prophet. What is involved here is the principle of incarnation. While Jesus was on this earth, He acted as a human being: He was so human, yet God was with Him, God was in Him, God was one with Him. The same principle of incarnation has been applied to us. Christ has been incarnated into all of us: He dwells in our spirit, and we are one spirit with Him. It is rather difficult for me to tell you whether it is only I that am speaking, or that when I am speaking it is also He speaking in me. I have no assurance whether I am speaking in the Spirit; yet as one who has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, I have confidence that He is one with me, so that when I speak, it may be that He speaks too. This is real spirituality.</p><h2 class="head1">CARING FOR OTHERS&rsquo; SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now let us go on to see more verses in this book regarding the human spirit. In chapter seven, verse 34, we read, &ldquo;The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.&rdquo; We need to have a holy, human spirit. Then in chapter eight, verse 12, we read, &ldquo;But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.&rdquo; We know that the conscience is the main part of the spirit. By this verse we see how careful the Apostle Paul was in dealing with others&rsquo; conscience. He did this in order to maintain their spirit. Now notice chapter ten, verses 28 and 29: &ldquo;But if any man say unto you, this is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord&rsquo;s, and the fulness thereof: conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man&rsquo;s conscience?&rdquo; These two verses prove again that in order to take care of others&rsquo; spirit we must take care of their conscience. We must not only maintain a strong spirit in ourselves, but see that others also have a strong spirit. When we are weak in our conscience, we are weak in our spirit. If we have a hole in our conscience, our spirit is broken.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SOWING SPIRITUAL THINGS</h2>
<p>Now go back to chapter nine, verse 11: &ldquo;If we have sown unto you spiritual things...&rdquo; This word &ldquo;spiritual things&rdquo; is the same word used in 12:1 and 14:1 for spiritual gifts. The Apostle Paul is saying that he has sown something spiritual. What was it? Spiritual gifts? Spiritual knowledge? We must realize that the spiritual thing sown by the Apostle Paul was Christ. Why? Because according to chapter two, verse 2, the Apostle said that he determined not to know anything among them but Christ. This proves that what the Apostle sowed was none other than Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VERSES MENTIONING MEETING</h2>
<p>Now let us look at the verses in chapter eleven relating to the matter of meeting. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;Ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.&rdquo; Verse 18: &ldquo;When ye come together in the church...&rdquo; Verse 20: &ldquo;When ye come together therefore into one place...&rdquo; Then verses 33 and 34: &ldquo;Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together...that ye come not together unto condemnation.&rdquo; Five times in this one chapter meeting together has been mentioned.</p>
<p>Finally let us read chapter sixteen, verse 14, &ldquo;Let all your things be done in love.&rdquo; And then verse 18, &ldquo;For they have refreshed my spirit and yours.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHAPTER BY CHAPTER REVIEW</h2>
<p>By picking up all these verses we get a full scope of the thought of the writer in this book. We cannot just take a few verses from chapter twelve or fourteen and isolate them from the context of the whole book. As I have already indicated, 1 Corinthians tells us clearly that God&rsquo;s intention is to put us into Christ and make Christ everything to us. We have seen in chapter one that Christ to us is the power and wisdom of God (v. 24); and of God are we in Christ Jesus, who is made unto us wisdom&mdash;righteousness, sanctification and redemption (v. 30). Then he goes on to tell us that this Christ who is the last Adam has been made a life-giving Spirit (15:45). Now all that He is to us must be realized, must be experienced not by any other organ of our being but the spirit. Thus, chapter two tells us what kind of person can apprehend Christ. It is not a soulish person, but a spiritual one (vv. 14, 15)&mdash;one who lives and acts in the human spirit. Following chapter two, the Apostle Paul tells the Corinthians, &ldquo;You are not spiritual. Though you have many gifts, I cannot say that you are spiritual. You are still in the flesh, even worse than in the soul&rdquo; (3:1-4). In chapter four he asks if they want him to come to them with a rod or with love and a meek spirit (v. 21). By this he tells the Corinthians that although they are not spiritual, yet he is spiritual. They are not acting in the spirit, yet he must act in the spirit. In chapter five he tells them, &ldquo;Do not think that I am away from you; I am still with you. To be absent in my body means nothing. I am present with you in my spirit&rdquo; (vv. 3, 4).</p>
<p>If we would be a right person and meet together in the right way, we must be this kind of person, like the Apostle Paul. If we are people like the Corinthians, whatever way we meet will be wrong. If we are carnal, if we are fleshly, regardless of how we meet, we are utterly wrong. To meet in the right way, we must be the right person, and the right person is one who lives, walks, and has his being in the spirit.</p>
<p>In chapter six we are told that the Holy Spirit of God dwells in us (v. 19) and that he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit (v. 17). Then we have chapter seven, which as we have seen, is so wonderful. Do not think that one who is walking, living, moving and having his being in the spirit is so sure that he is spiritual. In chapter eight, we have these verses: verse 1 tells us that knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. Then another verse tells us that we must take care of others&rsquo; conscience. We should not spoil, damage, or weaken the spirit of others. Chapter nine tells us that what he has sown as a spiritual thing is Christ (v. 11). And chapter ten tells us that Christ is the spiritual rock, not only following us, but also within us. He is also the spiritual meat and the spiritual drink (vv. 3, 4)&mdash;praise the Lord! In chapter eleven we see that when we are not meeting in the spirit, we are meeting not for a profit but for a loss (v. 17). Then from chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen, we have seen that the two main things we need are love and prophecy. Love is the life, and prophecy is the function. Finally in chapter fifteen we are told that this Christ who is our love and our life, our prophecy and our function, is the life-giving Spirit (v. 45). And in chapter sixteen Paul said that the brothers have refreshed his spirit and the spirit of others (v. 18). He said, &ldquo;Let all your things be done in love,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;My love be with you all in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (vv. 14, 24).</p><h2 class="head1">NOT GIFTS BUT LIFE</h2>
<p>We have gone through the entire sixteen chapters of 1 Corinthians, chapter by chapter. This is the foundation, this is the basis for our meeting together. It is not just a matter of gifts. The so-called Plymouth Brethren pluck out 14:26, and the Pentecostal brethren take just a few verses from chapters twelve and fourteen referring to the gifts. But we must take the whole book. By looking into the context of all the chapters and obtaining a full scope, we realize that the function in the meeting depends on the life in our daily walk. The way to meet together properly is to live properly. This simply means to take Christ as our life and our everything in our spirit. Therefore, we must learn how to exercise our spirit constantly. We have seen that the Apostle Paul was one who did this very thing. He was so strong in his spirit; he was forever exercising his spirit. This is the proper way to live, and this kind of living is the first necessity of the proper way to meet.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate. Suppose that we have a few brothers here who like to play basketball. They always spend their weekends and spare time engaging in the sport of basketball. Then suppose there is another group of brothers who like to have parties, to go to the beach, to see the movies, etc. Other brothers and sisters are always shopping for new clothes, new cars, new homes, new gadgets, etc., etc. Then on Sunday they all come together and ask me to speak to them concerning how to meet. Do you think that such people could meet in a proper way? If I encourage them to raise a building fund, to obtain the best and most eloquent speakers, to build a temple or a cathedral, that would be easy. But to tell them to exercise their spirit that they may all prophesy one by one would be impossible. They would chase me away.</p>
<p>I believe now we are all clear: in accord with the whole book of 1 Corinthians, the proper way for us as Christians to meet depends upon the proper living, the proper life. First Corinthians 14 is not the first chapter nor the last chapter of this book. There are so many chapters preceding it, telling how Christ is everything to us and how we must exercise our spirit to enjoy and experience Him in so many ways. Following chapter fourteen, we still have two chapters, telling how Christ is the life-giving Spirit, how our spirit needs to be continually refreshed with Christ, and how we need to live, move and do everything in love. If we are such persons, taking such a way to live day by day, we are qualified to meet together; then we have the right foundation, the right basis for our meeting. Do not pick out a verse here and there in the book and speak about gifts, tongues and healing, etc. That is not the message of 1 Corinthians. Where there are saints who mean business with the Lord, who have the real experience in their daily walk of taking Christ as their life, the meetings will be so proper and living. There is the life to support the meeting.</p>
<p>What is the proper way to meet? 1) We must have the proper life. We must exercise our human spirit all the time to take Christ. We must be so accustomed to exercising our spirit. It is not just a matter of doing this in the meetings, but in our daily walk with our children, our husbands, our wives. We must forget about exercising our minds and turn rather to exercising our spirit. Then our spirit will be so strong, living, and aggressive. By taking Christ as our life and experiencing Him as everything day by day, we will have a spiritual savings account. We will continually deposit something of Christ into this account and have a rich surplus of our experience of Him. We will come to the meeting with a strong spirit and a rich surplus. Then, 2) we only need to exercise our spirit to stand up in the meeting to function, to prophesy. It will be so spontaneous for us to do so; it will simply be an overflow of what we have been experiencing of Christ all day. There will be no strain; it will just be a continuation of our normal, daily experience of Christ. Whatever we do in the meeting will be living and rich with Christ in the spirit. Of course, it is also necessary in the meeting to drop all our old background. We must be delivered from the influence of thinking we are not capable of saying anything in the meetings, delivered from thinking we are not qualified, we are not committed with something from the Lord. No one else can function on our behalf in the meeting. We need to come to the meeting with a new concept, realizing that we are in something new, that we are out of the old Christianity. We need to come in a new and living way, accustomed to exercising our spirit, with Christ as our life and with a rich surplus of Christ. This is the way to meet.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BY DEMONSTRATING OUR SPIRIT</h1>
<p>The book of 1 Corinthians tells us that Christ was made a life-giving Spirit. This is wonderful! If He were not such a life-giving Spirit, all that He is would just be objective to us. But now He is the Spirit dwelling within our spirit, so that we can be one with Him in spirit. By taking Christ as everything in our spirit, we can have a proper life, we can enjoy Him all the day. This life is for the meeting, and the meeting is for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s Christianity the concept regarding Christian meetings is that they are to worship God. I do not say that this is wrong; I admit that there is a sense in which Christian meetings are to worship God. But we must realize that the best worship that we can render to God is to build up the church. The real worship that God desires is the building up of the church. This is the main purpose of the meetings.</p>
<p>Since, then, the meetings are for the building up of the church, what must we do in the meetings? If we read through 1 Corinthians again and again, and let us be reminded that this is practically the only book in the New Testament dealing with meetings, we will come to the conclusion that to build up the church we must prophesy. For us to prophesy as Christians is so easy. But do not use the dictionary of today&rsquo;s Christianity. By seeing the context of the entire book of 1 Corinthians, we realize what it means to prophesy. Yes, it does mean to predict something in a miraculous way, but this is not the main, primary meaning of the word &ldquo;prophesy&rdquo; in this book. In 1 Corinthians, to prophesy means to speak something for Christ. If to prophesy means only to predict some future occurrence, how could this build up the church? But in chapter fourteen of this book, we see repeatedly that prophesying is a matter of building up the church. Therefore, it must not be a kind of prediction, but a kind of ministry of Christ. We must take the context of the whole book. Paul said in chapter two, &ldquo;When I came to you, I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ&rdquo; (vv. 1, 2). In other words, Paul, in order to build up the church in Corinth, determined not to know anything among them but Christ. And Paul, that the church in Corinth may be built up, admonished them to prophesy (14:1, 5, 24, 31). By putting these two points together, we get the right meaning of prophesying in this book. It is simply to minister Christ to others that the church might be built up.</p>
<p>If in the meeting I predict that in 1970 certain things will happen, in 1971 certain other things will happen, and then in 1972, etc., etc., could this kind of prophecy edify the church? It would simply create gossip, and there would be no life in the church. That kind of prophecy does not build up the church. You cannot pluck the word &ldquo;prophesy&rdquo; from 1 Corinthians and say that it means to predict. You must read the whole book. Consider the entire ministry of the Apostle Paul. How much predicting did he do? Did he prophesy? Yes, he prophesied very much. His prophecy was mainly the ministry of Christ. He told the Corinthians in effect, &ldquo;When I come to you, I determine not to know anything but Christ; now you must follow me, you must follow me to prophesy in this way, not in a miraculous way, but in the way of ministering Christ to others that the church may be built up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all need a proper dictionary. I have just shown you the dictionary composed by the Apostle Paul. We all can (1 Cor. 14:31, Greek) and we all must prophesy in the meetings by speaking something for Christ. Do not say that you are &ldquo;chicken.&rdquo; We all must be &ldquo;lions&rdquo; in prophesying for Christ. It is rather difficult for me to gossip, but it is so easy to say something for Christ my Lord. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, how good You are, Hallelujah! Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now we must see that whatever we speak for Christ, whatever we do in the meeting, must be a demonstration of the spirit. This is quite important. Christ can never be ministered to others without the demonstration of our spirit. I&rsquo;m sorry to say that when some dear ones rise to speak in the meetings, there is no ministry of Christ because there is no demonstration of the spirit. That kind of speaking kills the meeting. When I see dear ones like that standing up, I am really frightened.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2:1-4 that when he came to the Corinthians, his speech and his preaching &ldquo;was not with enticing words of man&rsquo;s wisdom, but in demonstration of spirit and of power.&rdquo; This means that when he came to the Corinthians to minister Christ to them, by his speaking, by his preaching, he did not exercise his mind to use excellent words in an enticing way; rather, he exercised his spirit. His speaking was a real demonstration of his spirit. You may say that this kind of demonstration must be miraculous. But read chapter fourteen, verse 6, &ldquo;Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?&rdquo; This means that he did not come to them to speak in tongues, but to speak with clear, understandable words, in an ordinary way. He came to speak just the knowledge, just the doctrine, just the prophesying; yet with this ordinary speaking there was the demonstration of the spirit. We need to put these two verses together: chapter two, verse 4 and chapter fourteen, verse 6. By linking these two verses and indeed the whole book, we see what the Apostle Paul means by the demonstration of the spirit. Chapter two, verse 4, with chapter fourteen, verse 6, proves that it does not mean something miraculous and supernatural. Paul did not preach in that way; he preached in an ordinary way with ordinary words; yet his speaking was the demonstration of the spirit.</p>
<p>We all must learn to say something for Christ in the meeting with a demonstration of the spirit. We have to exercise this, we have to do this. There is no excuse. We cannot say that we were born timid, that we do not have a loud voice, or that we are not so eloquent. Second Timothy 1:7 says that God has not given us a &ldquo;spirit of fear&rdquo; or, according to a better translation, a &ldquo;spirit of cowardice.&rdquo; God has given us a &ldquo;spirit of power.&rdquo; Do not say you do not have a loud voice&mdash;everyone has a loud voice. I do not believe that when your house is on fire, you will announce quietly to the neighbors that your house is burning down. You will cry, <em>&ldquo;Fire! fire!&rdquo;</em> Then we will see what kind of a voice you have. Do not say anything about eloquence&mdash;we do not need eloquence. We can say much for Christ without eloquence.</p>
<p>The proper way to meet together is this: We must take Christ as our everything, realizing that He is the life-giving Spirit today in our spirit; therefore, we must be in the spirit, exercising our spirit continuously. Then we will experience Christ, partake of Christ, and enjoy Christ in a wonderful way. As such persons, when we come together, we will not meet for the religious worship of today&rsquo;s Christianity, but for the building up of the church by ministering Christ one to another with demonstration of the spirit. In this way, there can be no system of clergy or laity. Are you a clergyman or a layman? You should be neither. Praise the Lord, we are simply members of the Body and parts of the priesthood. This means that we all must prophesy. When the whole church comes together, all can prophesy one by one (1 Cor. 14:23, 24, 31), because everyone has something of Christ to share with the others.</p>
<p>I have been much exercised in recent days to find a way whereby all the Lord&rsquo;s children may function one by one in the meetings. To the present day in the local churches, the brothers and sisters are not all functioning among us. So many are still taking advantage of others. So many are still spectators and not participators. This troubles me greatly. If we do not come to the meeting, that is another thing. But if we do come, we must function one by one. If we are not functioning, we are not scriptural. &ldquo;Ye can all prophesy one by one&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:31, Greek). There is no escape, there is no exception; all must take part. And whenever anyone stands to prophesy, there should be a demonstration of the spirit. This is the proper way to meet.</p><h2 class="head1">METHOD DOES NOT WORK</h2>
<p>This is not a matter of learning methods&mdash;methods do not work. In a certain place in this country I heard the following: &ldquo;When we first began to meet together, all the people in the meeting were seated in one direction. Then we learned that the church in Los Angeles seated the people in four directions; so we changed the arrangement of our chairs accordingly. But we learned, however, that when the people were seated in one direction, there was only one direction of death in the meetings; then, after we changed the seating to four directions, there were four directions of death in the meetings. Therefore, do not follow Los Angeles.&rdquo; They are right. Do not follow the method&mdash;the method does not work. If we are going to speak something for Christ, we must live by Christ. The meeting life depends upon this.</p>
<p>In the early years of my Christian life I was in a group, the dear ones of which knew nothing else but studying the Bible in a literal way. I cannot tell you how much time they spent studying the Scriptures just according to the letter of the Word. Whenever they came together, it was just to discuss the letter of the Word. Suppose that we are this kind of people; do you think that when we come together we could speak something for Christ? It is impossible. If we have nothing of Christ, how can we say something for Christ? We can only speak the letters of the Bible. I knew another group of Christians, the members of which were exceedingly clever in fighting one another with Bible verses. They beat and accused one another by using the Scriptures themselves. How can such people speak something of Christ and for Christ?</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT A PERFORMANCE</h2>
<p>The Christian meeting is not a kind of performance, but a demonstration. To perform as an actor is simply a pretense. The Christian meeting must be an exhibition of what we are in Christ, not a performance of what we are not. Of course, if I just speak in tongues day by day, I will not be able to exhibit anything but tongues. If I am just studying the Word according to the letter, I will not be able to demonstrate anything but this. If I walk in the soul and live according to the flesh, when I come to the meeting to function, what can I demonstrate? Nothing but my soulish life, my fleshly daily walk. We cannot perform in the church; we can only demonstrate what we are. The meeting is the demonstration of what we experience of Christ; so we must have the proper walk in our daily life as a base for the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF PRACTICE</h2>
<p>We all must practice one thing in our daily life: to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord. In my early ministry, I advised people to read through the Bible once a year, to be faithful in the morning watch, to pray at least ten minutes daily, etc. That was my teaching. Of course, there is nothing wrong with that. But now, my ministry has changed greatly. The most important thing for you and me in our daily life is to continually exercise our spirit to touch the Lord. How? Just by this simple way of calling on His name. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Say it loudly. Don&rsquo;t say there is no one listening to you&mdash;there are many listening; at least the angels and the devils are listening. The more you practice in this way, the more you will be nourished. The more you speak, the more you will be inspired. The angels will listen to you, the evil spirits will also listen to you, and it will be a good exercise for your spirit.</p>
<p>Sisters, sometimes you must speak in your kitchen. Do not say there is nobody there. You have to say, &ldquo;Jesus is the Lord! Christ is my life!&rdquo; Just speak it out&mdash;you will see what victory you will have. Brothers, while you are gardening, you have to say something for Christ. You can speak to the birds: &ldquo;Little bird, I want to tell you that Christ is my life. My life is better than yours. I am so proud of Him.&rdquo; Tell the creatures something about Christ. I am not joking. You will learn how to function. Then, when you come to the meeting, it will be easy for you to say something.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we all must speak for Christ. We should not be dumb people; we do not worship dumb idols, but a living, speaking God. We all can speak&mdash;Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</p>
<p>We are now living in the age of the book of Revelation. In this book we read a number of times of a loud voice, a voice as many waters, as mighty thunders (7:10; 14:2; 19:1, 6). We must have a loud voice for Christ. We should not be so dumb; we must learn to say something all the time for the Lord, regardless of whether we have a visible audience or not. Wherever we are, we can tell the angels and the devils, &ldquo;Jesus is the Lord; Christ is my life. I am not here for myself, for my job, for my schooling; I am for Christ.&rdquo; We are not speaking just to the air. We are speaking to the principalities, the powers in the heavenlies. This is the way to exercise and strengthen our spirit. We need practice to speak for the Lord, and we have many opportunities every day. By such continual exercise, it will not be difficult to speak for Christ in the meetings.</p>
<p>Everything we learn requires practice. At the beginning we make many mistakes, but eventually we become experts. It is the same with the matter of demonstrating our spirit. And again I say, we have many opportunities every day to practice. We may not have a human audience, but we can always speak to the beings in the air. When we speak to human beings, there may not be so much need of exercising the spirit, but when we speak to the beings in the air, the mind does not work. To exercise the mind to speak to the angels is useless; we must exercise our spirit to speak to them.</p>
<p>We all must learn to continually say something for Christ in our daily life. Why are you so defeated? It is because you are so silent. The subtlety of the enemy is to keep your mouth shut. Speak something for Christ to the people in your office. The more you speak, the more victorious you will be. Learn to sing the hymns wherever you are. You may say that you are not a good singer, but there is no need for anyone to be a good singer. Everyone can sing. These two things&mdash;speaking and singing&mdash;will help you be so living, active, and aggressive in functioning in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BE PUNCTUAL</h2>
<p>Then when you come to the meeting, you must not come late. All late-comers are meeting-killers. If you mean business with the Lord for the meeting, you must be punctual. If it is not possible for you to come before the hour, at least you should come on time. If the meeting is due to start by 7:30, and at that time we just have a few gathered, the rest gradually trickling in thereafter, the meeting is greatly weakened. We must do our best to avoid being late to the meetings. Suppose we are a basketball team with five members, but when the time comes to play there are only two of us. After five minutes another two come, and after half an hour the fifth member arrives. What a poor game that would be! If we would play a good game, we must all be present before the time and prepare ourselves. Then when the time comes to play, we will be so alert and mutually encouraged. When we are all together in good time for the meeting, what an encouragement it is to the spirit. On the contrary, what a discouragement and shame it is when many come late. Furthermore, it is rather difficult for all the late-comers to function in the meetings. By coming late, you are out of the functioning spirit. Punctuality, however, is not a strictly legal matter: if sometimes it is really impossible for us to be on time, the Lord knows. In any case, we must do our best to avoid being late to the meetings. This will help greatly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COME TO THE FRONT</h2>
<p>Another practical matter relating to the meetings is this&mdash;always come to the front. The common way is for the people to find their seats in the back rows. We hate to see this. Try to come to the front; it helps you and it helps the meeting. This is not a small matter. We should fill up the front seats first. Whoever comes first, sits foremost. It is blessed to sit in the front.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AGAINST THE NATURAL MAKE-UP</h2>
<p>Finally, whenever you enter the meeting, learn never to be silent. You must oppose yourself; you must stand against your natural disposition. Never excuse yourself by saying that you are not an outspoken type of person. At least you can say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Jesus is my Lord!&rdquo; Just say it; you can. Then we have a few at the other extreme. Their disposition is to be so loud. They must stand against their natural disposition, not act overmuch, and give opportunity for others to participate. We all must be different in the spirit than we are according to our natural make-up. If I am one who is not disposed to speak in public, I must continually take the initiative to speak in the meetings for Christ; I must build up another kind of disposition. If I am one, on the other hand, for whom it is so easy to speak, I must oppose myself. It is good for me to be quiet for awhile until another disposition has been built up in me; then I will function in a proper way.</p>
<p>If we all learn these lessons, the meetings will be uplifted, enriched, and empowered. This kind of meetings will build up the church, edify people, and attract many new-comers. Let us forget our background and have a new start. Let us all come to the pure Word of God and learn a new way in the spirit. Perhaps by next month, the Lord will show us something newer than this; then we will go along with that. Let us drop the old ways and concepts and have an altogether new beginning in our meetings for the ministering of Christ to build up the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BY SINGING PRAISES</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIMARY FUNCTION IN MEETINGS</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14:26 says that when we all come together everyone has something, and the first item is a psalm; therefore, the psalm is the primary function in the meeting. What is a psalm? A psalm refers to singing, to praising. By this we must realize that the first thing we must do in the meetings is to sing praises.</p>
<p>In our meetings we come far short in singing. We need to spend much time singing. While I am speaking in the meeting or while others are speaking, at a certain point you may just start to sing. At a certain point when your spirit is touched and you are in a kind of ecstasy, simply break forth into singing and the whole congregation will follow. In Revelation chapter five, we read that when Christ ascended to the heavens the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders sang a new song, saying, &ldquo;Thou art worthy...&rdquo; They did not give a sermon or listen to a message; they just praised, praised, praised! &ldquo;Blessing and honor and glory be unto the Lamb for ever and ever.&rdquo; And the four living creatures said, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; How good it would be if we could have a meeting just for praising. This kind of praising will simply bring you into an ecstasy; you will be in the third heavens with everything under your feet.</p>
<p>The main thing in 1 Corinthians 14 is to prophesy, and the first thing is to praise. The central matter in the meeting of the church is to prophesy, to speak something for Christ, that the church might be built up, but the first thing in the meetings of the church is to praise. When we come together, everyone has a mouth to praise and a psalm for praising. Do you see the contrast between God&rsquo;s way and our present situation? We all must drop our background and linger no longer in the present, degraded situation. We must be brought back to the original way. We have not invented this; we have only discovered what has been here for nearly two thousand years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SCRIPTURES ON PRAISING</h2>
<p>Let us consider some of the verses in the Bible about praising. We have spent much time to discover these verses and put them together. They are gems from a mine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">2 CHRONICLES 20:22</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.&rdquo; There is no need for you to fight the battle; just praise the Lord and the enemy will be defeated. How can you overcome your temper? Forget about your temper and praise the Lord. Just by praising Him all your enemies will be under your feet. Just by praising Him you will ascend to the heavens. Just by praising Him all your besetting sins will be overcome. Hallelujah, Christ is victor! Just praise the Lord; God will set an ambush against the enemy, and he will be smitten. It is so simple.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PSALM 5:11</h2>
<p>&ldquo;But let all those that put their trust in Thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because Thou defendest them: let them also that love Thy name be joyful in Thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ever shout for joy&rdquo;&mdash;not once a day or once in a while, but ever. You may say that this is a little too much, but this is a psalm. You may say it is wild, but David said it is poetic. Have you ever shouted? How about today? What does it mean to shout? To shout is not to call or to cry in a mild way, but more or less in a wild way. Sometimes, if not all the time, you must shout to your dear wife, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; Sometimes in the meetings some of the brothers must shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; Sometimes when you are saying, &ldquo;O Lord, O Lord,&rdquo; it seems that you are not getting through to touch the Lord. If you will raise your voice and shout from deep within, &ldquo;O LORD! O LORD!&rdquo; you will break right through and touch the Lord. Even the demons and the devil are afraid of our shouting. Do not be so cowardly. Sometimes when you say &ldquo;O Lord&rdquo; in a mild way, it really works; but sometimes it does not work and you must shout, &ldquo;O LORD, AMEN, HALLELUJAH!&rdquo; The Old Testament saints experienced this. If they shouted, how much more must we shout!</p><h2 class="head1">PSALM 8</h2>
<p>Most of us are familiar with this Psalm, but in order to help us realize its message I must refer to the previous Psalms. In Psalms 3 through 7, we see how sad was the situation of the Psalmist. But suddenly in Psalm 8 the Spirit came in with this: &ldquo;O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth!&rdquo; What a change! If we spend much time reading the newspapers, we will say, &ldquo;How long! How long!&rdquo; But if we turn to the spirit, we will say, &ldquo;How excellent is Thy name in all the earth!&rdquo; We will not care for man; we will not care for the wars; we will not care for all the riots and disturbances. We will only say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now note how the Psalmist continues: You have set your glory above the heavens, but You have ordained strength out of the mouth of little ones on this earth to silence all the enemies (our paraphrase). In the previous Psalms the Psalmist prayed that the Lord would deal with all the adversaries, all the enemies. In the Psalms the adversaries refer to the opposing ones among the Lord&rsquo;s people: for example, in the time of David, Absalom, David&rsquo;s own son, was an adversary. The enemies are the foes from without, like the heathen. The adversaries are within and the enemies are without, and when they come against you, there is no need for you to smite them; just say, &ldquo;O Lord, how excellent is Thy name!&rdquo; Your praising will silence them; your praising will frighten them away; your praising is the secret.</p>
<p>The second verse of Psalm 8 has these two meanings: out of the mouth of the babes, the little ones, the unweaned ones, God could 1) establish strength and 2) establish praise. What is the strength? The praise is the strength. The praise silences the enemy. You may say that you are weak as David said in Psalm 6:2. But even if you are a babe, even if you are a suckling, the weakest of the weak, God can establish from you the strength that will smite the enemies. <em>But you must open your mouth to praise.</em> If you simply praise Him, God will establish strength out of your mouth stronger than an army. Hallelujah, praise the Lord! Regardless of how weak you are, regardless of how weak I am, regardless of how weak we all are, if we will open our mouths and say, &ldquo;O Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth,&rdquo; God will establish the strength to shut the mouths of all the enemies. In what way? Just by praising Him the power will break forth. It is not a small matter.</p>
<p>I am the same as many of you. In my youth I attended Christian meetings continually. I liked to hear messages, especially those from the mouths of famous speakers and spiritual giants. But, I tell you, simply doing this did not work so well. Could we not come to the meetings without a message, without a sermon, but just praising and singing? Have you ever seen the power released from the praises out of the mouths of babes and sucklings? Do you trust in the praising as much as in the message?</p>
<p>Let us come back to the Word, back to the beginning. When the Pharisees spoke with the Lord Jesus concerning marriage and divorce, the Lord Jesus told them, &ldquo;From the beginning it was not so&rdquo; (Matt. 19:8). We all must go back to the beginning. In the beginning of the church in the early days, it was not as it is today with teaching upon teaching, message upon message, sermon upon sermon. It was not so in the beginning. In the last verse of Acts chapter two it says that the church, the local church, was &ldquo;praising God.&rdquo; It was a praising church, not a sermon-listening church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PSALM 48</h2>
<p>This Psalm says, &ldquo;Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised.&rdquo; We cannot tell how great He is, but we must greatly praise Him. Our praise must match His greatness; we must have greatness in our praising. I say again, we must all forget our background. According to 1 Corinthians 14:26 the primary thing we must do is to sing a psalm. Singing and praising must be the first thing in our meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE</h2>
<p>Then what about the matter of noise? Some may not agree with the matter of making noise and consider it a kind of confusion. But in the Psalms, it is said seven times, &ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto God&rdquo; (66:1; 81:1; 95:1, 2; 98:4, 6; 100:1), and one time, &ldquo;Make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise&rdquo; (98:4). The Bible says, &ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto God.&rdquo; Another version says, &ldquo;Make a joyous shout unto God&rdquo;&mdash;not only a joyful noise, but a joyous shout. We must drop our backgrounds, and come to the meetings in the spirit and make a joyful noise to praise the Lord.</p>
<p>We all know the story of how Paul and Silas sang praises to God at midnight in the prison. Their praising caused an earthquake which released all the prisoners and eventually brought the jail keeper and his family to the Lord. Do you see the power and strength of praising?</p><h2 class="head1">EPHESIANS AND COLOSSIANS</h2>
<p>In Ephesians we are told not only to sing and make melody, but also to speak one to another (5:19 &ldquo;speaking to yourselves&rdquo; should be &ldquo;speaking one to another&rdquo;) in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. The psalms are the longest praises, the songs are the shortest ones, and the hymns are of medium length. There are three degrees of poetry. This means that we must use all kinds of praises&mdash;psalms, hymns, and songs. Some have said that the hymns we have written are too long. It is true that we have one hymn of twenty-six verses and others of fifteen and sixteen verses. But there is at least one psalm with one hundred and seventy-six stanzas (Psa. 119). I do hope that someday we will have a hymn of a hundred and seventy-six verses. Sometimes to express our praise we need a long psalm. Many times we need the shorter songs. It is so living and releasing to come out spontaneously with some of the shorter songs in our meetings. We must learn to praise the Lord with all kinds of poetry.</p>
<p>In Colossians chapter three, verse 16, we have two things put together: dealing with the Word and singing the hymns. When we have the Word of Christ dwelling in us richly, we will be full of Christ, we will have the outpouring of the inner fulness in singing and praising. If we could all learn how to praise and sing the hymns in our meetings, it would be much better than hearing a message.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PSALM 150 AND REVELATION</h2>
<p>Altogether, there are one hundred and fifty Psalms. The first Psalm says, &ldquo;Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly...&rdquo; But Psalm 150, the last Psalm, says, &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; which means, Praise the Lord. In this Psalm every sentence begins with the word &ldquo;praise.&rdquo; It says praise the Lord in this way, then praise the Lord in the second way, then praise the Lord in the third way, etc., etc. There are ten ways of praising the Lord. Eventually it says, &ldquo;Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.&rdquo; The book of Psalms is a condensation, a miniature picture, of the whole Bible. Such a book ends with praising, with Hallelujahs. Why must the Psalms end with praising? Because by the end of the Psalms we have the city with the temple, we have God&rsquo;s habitation on this earth in the universe.</p>
<p>Now let us come to the end of the Bible. The whole Bible ends also with Hallelujahs. &ldquo;And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Hallelujah...&rdquo; Why at the end of the Bible is there such a universal Hallelujah? Because of the Bride, the New Jerusalem, the mingling of divinity with humanity. In the entire universe there is something marvelous. It is rather difficult to give this marvelous thing a title; we have nothing to say but Hallelujah!</p>
<p>I long to see the day when in the local churches there will be nothing but, &ldquo;Hallelujah, Amen, Praise the Lord,&rdquo; all the day. Do you expect to have more teachings? Then you are still in Psalm 1. You may say that you appreciate Psalm 1 so much. But that proves that you have never grown; you are still in the first stage of the Psalms. You must go on from Psalm 1. In the first Psalm there is no praising; there is only the blessing for him who keeps the law. God is not satisfied with this; God comes in and says that he who kisses the Son is blessed, he who puts his trust in the Son is blessed (Psa. 2). It is not a matter of keeping the law, but of kissing Christ. Peter on the mount of transfiguration foolishly said, &ldquo;Let us make here three tabernacles; one for Thee, and one for Moses [the law], and one for Elias [the prophets].&rdquo; Then suddenly a voice from heaven said, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son...hear ye Him.&rdquo; Immediately Moses and Elias disappeared and they saw no one save Christ. On the day of Pentecost Peter spoke again. But this time he did not tell the people that Jesus was good and Moses was good too. On that day he declared the second Psalm: &ldquo;Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ&rdquo; (Acts 2:36). It is not a matter of how much you love the law, but how much you kiss the Son. We have already considered Psalm 8: there is nothing in this Psalm about keeping the law, but even in Psalm 8 we do not have the maturity. We must go on until we hit Psalm 150. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah! This Psalm starts with Hallelujah and ends with Hallelujah, and ten times plus one throughout it says &ldquo;Praise God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Praise Him,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Praise the Lord.&rdquo; Praise Him in this way, and praise Him in that way&mdash; this is maturity. There is no more exhortation, no teaching, but praising the Lord. &ldquo;Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.&rdquo; This is the highest and the best.</p>
<p>John in the Revelation at the end of the Bible does not say, &ldquo;I want you all to know that you must love the Lord, consecrate yourself, and build up one another.&rdquo; No. At the end of the Bible all we have is praising, praising upon praising, Hallelujah, Amen, Hallelujah! The less we praise, the younger we are. The less we sing to the Lord, the more childish we are. We all must learn to sing the praises in the meetings of the church. So we have the verse, &ldquo;When ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm...&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:26). Do you have a psalm? Amen, Hallelujah!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BY CHRIST SINGING IN OUR PRAISING</h1>
<p>The highest point and peak of prayer is praise. Praise is much better than prayer; so we must go on from prayer to praise. When you pray and pray until you reach the highest point, then prayer is over and praise begins. You are on the top of prayer, and the top of prayer is praise. Do you think that we will still pray in the New Jerusalem? I tell you, in that day we will sing all the time. We will sing, &ldquo;It is done, it is done; prayer is over, praise begun!&rdquo; We must have the foretaste of the New Jerusalem now.</p>
<p>Now we must learn something deeper concerning praise; we must see something not just in a general way, but in a deeper way. I have never been so concerned regarding the utterance as I am when we come to this matter. Now we are touching something very deep and tender. It is easy to speak concerning something superficial, but really difficult to convey a matter so deep and precious as this. I look to the Lord that you will exercise your spirit with your understanding to follow me.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DECLARING THE FATHER&rsquo;S NAME</h2>
<p>Have you ever heard a message telling of the Lord Jesus singing praises to God? We have one verse (v. 12) in Hebrews chapter two, a quotation from Psalm 22:22, which says, &ldquo;I will declare Thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto Thee.&rdquo; This is the Lord Jesus speaking, and He says, &ldquo;I will declare Thy name.&rdquo; That means the Father&rsquo;s name. He goes on to say, &ldquo;In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto Thee.&rdquo; At what point of time did the Lord declare the Father&rsquo;s name to His brethren? And at what time did the Lord sing hymns of praise unto the Father? Have you ever considered this? Let us look at Psalm 22, where these words are first recorded.</p>
<p>The first part of the Psalm deals with the crucifixion of Christ: &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?&rdquo; (v. 1). When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He cried these very words (Matt. 27:46), and His cry amazed all those who heard. He was quoting and fulfilling Psalm 22:1. In verse 16 of that Psalm we read, &ldquo;They pierced my hands and my feet,&rdquo; and in verse 18, &ldquo;They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.&rdquo; These verses relating to the Lord&rsquo;s death are fulfilled and recorded in the four Gospels (Luke 23:34; Matt. 27:35). Then we come abruptly into the second part of this Psalm in verse 22, where the Lord says, &ldquo;I will declare Thy name unto my brethren.&rdquo; What is this? This was fulfilled in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. After the crucifixion in the first part of Psalm 22, we have the resurrection in the second part. While He was on the cross He cried, &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?&rdquo; But later in His resurrection He declared the Father&rsquo;s name unto His brethren. On the morning of the resurrection day, as recorded in John 20:17, Jesus said to Mary, &ldquo;Go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God and your God.&rdquo; Jesus did not tell Mary, &ldquo;Go to my disciples,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Go to my friends,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Go to my brethren.&rdquo; Before the day of resurrection, no human being was a brother to Christ as a son of God. It was by His resurrection that all the disciples, all the believers in Him, became His brethren. So He said to Mary, &ldquo;Go to my brethren.&rdquo; By His resurrection God has begotten us (1 Pet. 1:3), God has regenerated us as His sons; so we have become the brethren of the Lord. It was at that time that He declared the name of the Father to His brethren.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SINGING PRAISE IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Then when is the time when in the midst of the church the Lord sang praise unto the Father? On the day of resurrection? The church was not formed on the day of resurrection. It was not till the day of Pentecost that the church actually came into existence. But here we have a difficulty, for on the day of Pentecost Jesus was in the heavens. How then could He sing praise to the Father in the midst of the church? On the day of Pentecost, Peter told the people that &ldquo;this Jesus hath God raised up,&rdquo; saying to Him, &ldquo;Sit Thou on my right hand&rdquo; (Acts 2:32, 34). If Jesus is at the right hand of God, how can He sing hymns of praise to the Father in the midst of the church?</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, when the Lord Jesus was in the heavens at the right hand of God, the church came into existence. On that day there were one hundred and twenty disciples plus three thousand new believers, making a total of three thousand one hundred and twenty constituting the church. For simplicity&rsquo;s sake let us consider only fifty believers meeting in a locality as a church. How could Jesus sing praises to the Father in the midst of that church? Have you ever been in a meeting where you saw Jesus singing in the midst of the church?</p><h2 class="head1">SINGING IN OUR SINGING</h2>
<p>The answer is this: when we are singing to the Father, Jesus is singing within us. <em>Now</em> is the time when Hebrews 2:12 is being fulfilled. When we are singing a hymn to the Father, Jesus, the firstborn among many brethren, is singing within our singing. That is the way He sings praises to the Father in the midst of the church. He sings within our singing.</p>
<p>But here is a problem: are you sure that whenever you sing in the church, Christ is singing within your singing? When you say Amen, does Christ say Amen within you? Are you assured that when you say Hallelujah, Christ also says Hallelujah within your Hallelujah? If you could not say yes, then I must tell you to shut your mouth. Don&rsquo;t say Hallelujah any more unless you are assured that when you say Hallelujah, the Lord Jesus says Hallelujah within you.</p>
<p>Do you feel after reading this that I am binding your Hallelujahs? Yes, I do bind what has already been bound: I do loose what has already been loosed. I do not agree with the old way of Christianity&mdash;that is something dead, that is something fallen. I do not agree either with anything that is an abuse of our liberty. It is so easy for us to go either to one extreme or to another. On one hand we need to be centripetal, that is, tending toward the center; on the other hand we need also to be centrifugal, that is, tending to move away from the center. These two laws will keep us in the proper balance. On one hand, it is not right to take the old way of deadness; neither is it right to take a new way of looseness, abusing and misusing our liberty. I am not trying to bind you; my intention is to release you. But you must realize that all the release, all the liberty, must be in the spirit. When I say Hallelujah, I must have the assurance that the Lord Jesus within me is saying Hallelujah. If the Lord Jesus is saying inwardly, &ldquo;No, I do not go along with your Hallelujah,&rdquo; then my Hallelujah is entirely wrong. The Lord Jesus today is one with all His members.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW GOD ESTABLISHES PRAISE</h2>
<p>Hebrews 2 refers to two Psalms, Psalm 8 and Psalm 22. We have seen that Psalm 8 speaks concerning Christ: &ldquo;What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that Thou visitest him? For Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor...Thou hast put all things under his feet.&rdquo; We know that this man, this one of whom the psalmist is speaking, is Jesus. Psalm 8 tells us that Jesus was identified with man. He was the Creator of all the angels, but He was made a little lower than the angels. He was incarnated to be a man, and by His incarnation He was identified with man. The Hebrew text for the word &ldquo;man&rdquo; in the question, &ldquo;What is man?&rdquo; is a word which denotes a fragile man, a weak man. Man is so fragile and weak; yet Jesus identified Himself with such a creature. While He was on earth, practically speaking, He was not physically strong. He was in a sense weak and fragile; He identified Himself with such a race.</p>
<p>Psalm 8 tells us that from the youngest ones, the least ones, the weakest of such a race, God could do one thing&mdash;He could establish praise. How could God establish praise out of the mouths of such weak ones? Just by these four or five steps: 1) Christ&rsquo;s incarnation. The entire universe had never seen such a thing. God could establish praises out of the mouths of babes and sucklings firstly by Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, by His identification with man. 2) His crucifixion. Of course, in Psalm 8 we do not have the crucifixion, just the incarnation with the glorification. Man is made a little lower than the angels&mdash;this is the incarnation. He is crowned with glory and honor&mdash;this is the glorification. But following Psalm 8, in Psalm 22 His crucifixion is covered. 3) His resurrection. In Psalm 22, after the crucifixion, we have the resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s declaring of the Father&rsquo;s name to His brethren was a sign of His resurrection. 4) His glorification. After His resurrection He was crowned with glory and honor. 5) His enthronement. All things have been put under His feet. He has been enthroned as the Lord of all, as the King of kings.</p>
<p>By these five ways&mdash;the incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and enthronement&mdash;God could establish praises out of the mouths of the weakest of this weak race. By these five steps of Christ, God fulfills Psalm 8, verse 2. You may ask, &ldquo;What has this to do with me?&rdquo; The answer is&mdash;too much! If we did not have these five major steps of Christ in this universe, none of us could utter a word of praise. All the mouths of men would be shut. How could we praise God without Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and enthronement? You may say, &ldquo;O God, You are my Creator!&rdquo; But God would say, &ldquo;You are a sinner!&rdquo; Then what will you say? You may say, &ldquo;O God, I thank You for Your mercy.&rdquo; But God would say, &ldquo;How could I have mercy upon you?&rdquo; Without the work of Christ there is no way.</p>
<p>Oh, how we need to see the way whereby God can establish praises out of the mouths of us who are the weakest, the least, and less than the least! By His incarnation, Christ was made one with us. We are lower than the angels, and He is too; He was made the same as we. By His crucifixion, all our problems have been solved. God can never say to you, &ldquo;You are a sinner.&rdquo; If God says this to you, you must tell Him, &ldquo;O God, You are not just, You are not righteous, You are not fair in saying this, because my substitute Christ has died for me.&rdquo; You see, there is no reason whatever for you not to praise. By Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, Christ has become one with me. By His crucifixion, I am no more a sinner. By His resurrection, I become a son of God. Tell me, who is greater, the President of the United States or you? Suppose that the President is not a son of God&mdash;is he greater, or you? You are greater! You have to shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah! I am greater, I am greater!&rdquo; What makes you so great? His resurrection. By His resurrection, you have been made a brother of Christ. Then, do you have any reason not to praise? Do you see? In this way God has established praises out of the mouths of the weakest. You may have many children and may, materially speaking, be rather poor, but are you not more glorious than the greatest millionaire? Praise the Lord! In His glorification, we all have been glorified. We are more glorious! You see, it is so easy for God to establish praises out of the mouths of so many weaker ones. If you have ever seen the incarnation of Christ, the crucifixion, the resurrection, the glorification, and the enthronement, you will be beside yourself saying, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not all. The most wonderful thing is that this incarnated One, this crucified One, this resurrected One, this glorified One, this enthroned One is altogether today the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). And He as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit indwells my spirit, and I am one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). What is this! Oh, what is this!</p>
<p>Hebrews 2 refers us to Psalm 8, which tells of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, glorification and enthronement. Hebrews 2 also refers us to Psalm 22, which speaks of His crucifixion and resurrection. When we put these two Psalms together, we have these five marvelous, glorious steps of Christ: His incarnation, His crucifixion, His resurrection, His glorification, and His enthronement. By all these five steps, Christ has been made one with us, and we have been made one with Him. Now Christ is not only in the church, but Christ is the church (1 Cor. 12:12). And He says, &ldquo;I will sing praise unto Thee in the midst of the church.&rdquo; In what way? By being one with the church, by being one with all the members, and by them being made one with Him. When they sing, He sings in their singing. He sings by their singing; He sings within their singing. Their singing is His singing. They are one with Him, and He is one with them. They are in Him, and He is in them. Hallelujah!</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICALLY REALIZED IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>How is such a oneness actually and practically realized? Only by our being altogether in the Spirit and in our spirit. Christ was incarnated, crucified, resurrected, glorified, and enthroned; and after all this, such a Christ was made the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. This wonderful Christ, this all-inclusive Spirit, has come to indwell our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), and today He is one Spirit with our spirit. Whenever we say, &ldquo;O Father,&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;O Father.&rdquo; Whenever we say, &ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; this is also His expression, this is also His Hallelujah. But we must be sure that we are in the spirit, that we are speaking in the spirit, that we are singing in the spirit. If we are not speaking and singing in the spirit, He is not speaking and singing. On one hand, we must give up all the formalities, the rituals, and the deadness; but on the other hand, we must be careful not to abuse our liberty, not to praise in a light way. We must be sure that whenever we say Hallelujah, we are in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VOICE OF PRAISE</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:2-3 tells us that the Apostle John heard a voice in the heavens singing a new song. This voice, he says, was as the voice of many waters. The voice of many waters indicates a great noise. Then he says that the voice is as the voice of mighty thunderings. What is this? To be like thunder means not only that there is a great noise, but that in this noise there is something majestic. Our praises, our Hallelujahs, must be a great noise, but with them there must also be something of majesty, something of weight. We should not give the sense of lightness or looseness in our praising. But this is not all: there is a third aspect. He says that this voice was as harpers harping with their harps. This means that the praising voice is musical, harmonious, and exceedingly pleasant. On one hand it is noiseful and majestic, and on the other hand it is full of music and harmony. Can you imagine such a thing? I do believe that if we follow the life-giving Spirit who dwells within our spirit, He will bring this forth. In our meetings, in a sense, we will be so noisy, but in another sense we will be so majestic, so full of the divine, heavenly majesty; and in a third sense our praise will be so pleasant to all the ears, just as harpers harping with their harps.</p>
<p>We do not desire to be either formal, fundamental, or pentecostal, but we do want to be really spiritual. We don&rsquo;t care for the formal or fundamental practices, nor the so-called pentecostal manifestations. Now the Lord is recovering something genuine, something really spiritual. In the beginning, in the early church, it was not like today&rsquo;s Christianity. At that time all the believers came together with an open heart and a released spirit, singing and praising in the spirit, being one with the Lord. How much we need to sing the praises in the spirit, and how much we need to be cultivated in the spirit. Many of us may have been released in our spirit, but we still must learn the lesson on the other side. We should not be bound; neither should we misuse our liberty. We must be released, but we must also be somewhat restricted; we have the freedom, but we should not abuse it. To make noise is easy, but to make noise with majesty and music is not so easy. If we all learn to be in the Spirit, not pentecostal, not fundamental, but just spiritual, our praising will be like that. This is an exercise not only for the meetings, but for all our daily lives. Every day we can practice the exercising of our spirit, we can practice singing praises to the Lord, not in an emotional way, but in a spiritual way, not to release our emotion but to release our spirit. By such an exercise we will know what it is to be emotional and what it is to be spiritual. We will know what it is to be released and what it is to abuse our liberty; we will know what is just noise, and what is noise with majesty and music. If we learn this lesson day by day, when we come together our praising will be marvelous.</p>
<p>Many of us in the local churches are just beginning to learn to meet. We are just learners. We have been released from the bondage of the old way, but we are still not adequately experienced and cultivated in the new way of meeting in the spirit. This requires more and more exercise. Do not withhold from praising the Lord, fearing that you may not be in the spirit. Shout your Hallelujahs. If you keep on crawling, you will eventually learn to walk. But do not be so self-confident that your walk is one hundred percent proper. On one hand you need to exercise, and on the other hand you must be open to learn the proper lessons. Crawl as much as you can, but do not be confident that you are walking properly. You still must be proved.</p>
<p>I do believe the Lord will bring us on and on until we reach a degree of maturity. I say again, we do not like to be formal, fundamental, or pentecostal; we just want to be so simple in the spirit. This requires much exercise, much grace, much humility and patience. For this we also need love for the Lord and for one another. Then we will all go on, and the day will come that whenever we meet together our praising will be so full of noise, yet with divine majesty and heavenly music. This is the proper way for us to meet.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

THE EXPERIENCES OF CHRIST</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PSALM 68</h2>
<p>(A medley of various versions and translations, which when blended give a better rendering of this passage than the King James Version or any other single version.)</p>
<ol class="none">

<li><sup>9</sup> Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby Thou didst restore and confirm Thy heritage [the land], when it was languished.</li>
<li><sup>10</sup> Thy flock found a dwelling-place in it: Thou, O God, didst prepare it in Thy goodness for the needy.</li>
<li><sup>11</sup> The Lord sendeth the news of victory: great is the host of women that publish the tidings:</li>
<li><sup>12</sup> &ldquo;The kings of the armies, they flee, they flee!&rdquo; And the women that tarry at home divide the spoil,</li>
<li><sup>13</sup> though they lie among the sheepfolds: the wings of a dove covered with silver and its pinions with glittering gold.</li>
<li><sup>14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings therein, it was as when it snoweth in Zalmon.</li>

<li><sup>17</sup> The chariots of God are twenty thousands, even thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary.</li>

</ol>
<p>In these days so many books, so many chapters, so many verses of the Bible have been opened up to us. This opening of the Word includes Psalm 68. For many years I have been seeking to understand this Psalm, but not until recent days has the whole Psalm been opened. This Psalm is rich in praise out of the experiences of Christ, and that is how we must meet.</p>
<p>We have seen firstly that whenever we come together for a meeting of the church, we must praise. A psalm is the first item mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Secondly, we have seen that praising is something established by the Lord out of the mouths of babes and sucklings through His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and enthronement. The more we know and participate in these five steps of Christ, the more praises we will have to offer to Him. We need all these steps that the Lord&rsquo;s praises may be fully and richly established out of our mouths. Why is the praising in our meetings so poor? We do have a heart to praise and a burden in our spirit to praise; yet we do not have the content in our praise; we do not know adequately for what to praise; we do not have the utterance. Why? Because we have too little experience of these five steps of Christ.</p>
<p>The third point in this matter of praising is that Christ sings praises in the church. In the following chapter we will come back to that point. Here in this chapter we need to see something as an insertion into the praises of Christ to the Father in the church. If we do not have this insertion, it is rather difficult to see more regarding the Lord&rsquo;s singing of the hymns of praise in the church.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE NEW SONG</h2>
<p>Let us look firstly at a few verses in Revelation.</p>
<p class="indent1">&ldquo;And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and with Him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father&rsquo;s name written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and the voice which I heard was as of harpers harping with their harps: and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb&rdquo; (Rev. 14:1-4).</p>
<p>Notice it says that they sang a new song, and no man could learn that song. Why? Praises have been established by the Lord out of the mouths of babes and sucklings: even the little babes can praise. Why then does it say here that no man could learn that song? The answer is that no man can learn it without experience. There are some praises which require experience. Look at the moon and the stars&mdash;how majestic and lovely they are! Look at the trees, the flowers, and the birds&mdash;how pleasant! For this kind of praise, we need no experience. But for these one hundred and forty-four thousand to praise Christ in a special way, they must have the proper and particular experiences of Christ. If we lack these experiences, we can never praise the Lord to such a degree. We all can praise Him in a general way, in a religious way, in a natural way; but if we would praise Him in a special and deeper way, we need some experience of Him. Our praises are limited by our experiences of Christ. How much, how deeply, or how highly we have experienced Christ will be the measure of our praise. Our praises can never exceed our experiences of Christ. If our experiences of Him have not reached a certain stage, when others sing praises so highly and deeply, we cannot follow, we cannot learn. Not until our experiences of Christ have reached that extent can we also sing that new song. This is the foundation for the message of this chapter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PSALM 19 COMPARED WITH PSALM 68</h2>
<p>Now before we turn to Psalm 68, let us consider briefly another Psalm, Psalm 19. The first part of this Psalm speaks marvelously of creation&mdash;the heavens and the sun. The second part, beginning with verse 7, speaks about the law. This is really good. I do not think I need to say anything concerning this Psalm&mdash;everyone can understand it. But do you understand Psalm 68? Now compare these two Psalms. Do you see the difference? Psalm 19 is certainly good, but the praises there are just according to nature, according to the law. I would not say it is a natural and religious praise, but it is not so deep and so rich as Psalm 68. We Christians have always been appreciating Psalm 19 so much. I have no intention to depreciate it. I only ask you to compare it with Psalm 68. There is a real progress in the praises in the Psalms; we must go on from Psalm 19 with its praises according to nature and the law to Psalm 68 with praises according to the experiences of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S VICTORY</h2>
<p>Let me in a simple way point out the main points in this Psalm. First of all, we have the victory in the battle over the enemies: &ldquo;Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered&rdquo; (v. 1). This is not just the battle, but the victory in the battle. The battle is over, and now we have the victory. This is a triumphant Psalm, a Psalm with triumph and victory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S HABITATION</h2>
<p>The second main point of this Psalm is the dwelling place of God on earth&mdash;&ldquo;That the Lord God might dwell with them&rdquo; (v. 18). Several times we see the words &ldquo;the dwelling place of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;the habitation of God,&rdquo; &ldquo;the sanctuary,&rdquo; &ldquo;the holy place.&rdquo; &ldquo;A Father of the fatherless, and a protector of the widows, is God in his holy habitation&rdquo; (v. 5). The victory in the battle, the victory won by Christ, is for the building up of God&rsquo;s habitation even today on this earth. On the earth usurped by Satan, among a rebellious people, God could accomplish such a marvelous thing as building up a habitation. Do you think that in a city so sinful as Los Angeles God could have a habitation, a local church? Yet it is here! In such a pit of corruption there is a holy habitation built up by God. God could say to Satan, &ldquo;Regardless of how much you have corrupted the people, I can still build My holy habitation, even in Los Angeles, the city of Hollywood!&rdquo; It is glorious! Los Angeles is famous for new cults: all the strange things, all the far out things, all the evil things of the earth make their nest here. But in such a place God has built up the local church as His habitation. Is not this a real victory? If the Lord had never won the victory, how could He accomplish this? To my realization, the city of Los Angeles, which takes the lead in evil throughout the world, is the best place for a testimony for the Lord. In the midst of the most corrupt, the most evil, the most sinful place, God could have a holy sanctuary. The victory of Christ is for the habitation of God on this earth, in this last age, among a rebellious and corrupted people.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR HOME</h2>
<p>But not only does God need a habitation&mdash;we also need a home. So in this Psalm we have words such as &ldquo;a home&rdquo; and &ldquo;a family,&rdquo; etc. &ldquo;God placeth the solitary in families and giveth the desolate a home to dwell in&rdquo; (v. 6). Thus, we have these two aspects of the second main point: God&rsquo;s habitation and our home. We must realize that God&rsquo;s habitation is our home, and our home must be His habitation. This dwelling place is a mutual habitation: God dwells in us and we dwell in God. This is our home; this is the local church. The victory of Christ is for this&mdash;for the building up of God&rsquo;s habitation and the securing of our home.</p>
<p>Hallelujah! Now there is no need for God to isolate Himself in the heavens; there is no need for us to call upon Him long distance. Now we can speak with Him as children with their Father at home; we can speak with Him face to face in the local church. He is at home here; He has established His habitation here. Formerly, it is true, God was on this earth, but He was wandering on this earth. You remember how Jacob, when he was fleeing from his brother, was homeless and wandering. One night he had a dream, a dream about the house of God. That dream signifies not only that he was homeless, but that God also was homeless. As long as we have no home on this earth, God also is homeless. But, praise the Lord, today we have a home, God has a home, and we are at home with our Father. So many, when they come into the local church, exclaim, &ldquo;I am home, I am home!&rdquo; In the local church we simply feel that we are home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>In this Psalm we do not have the word &ldquo;enjoyment,&rdquo; but we do have the fact. In the habitation which God has built up by the victory of His dear Son Jesus Christ, God is everything to us. In His habitation God is a Father to the fatherless and a protector to the widows. In His habitation He daily loads us with good. All the fulness of the Godhead is in the church for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Not only do we enjoy all that God is to us, but we enjoy the spoils of Christ&rsquo;s victory&mdash;&ldquo;The women that tarry at home divide the spoil&rdquo; (v. 12). What are the spoils? They are &ldquo;the wings of a dove covered with silver and its pinions with glittering gold&rdquo; (v. 13). The dove is the Spirit, and wings in the Bible signify flying power. &ldquo;They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles...&rdquo; (Isa. 40:31). O the wings of a dove! This is the spiritual strength, the spiritual power, the power in the Holy Spirit and the power in our spirit. The wings are covered with silver&mdash;this means that they are strengthened with the redemption of the Son, the all-inclusive death of Christ. They are also covered with glittering gold&mdash;this means that they are strengthened by the nature of God, the life of God, the fulness of the Godhead. The more we enjoy the spoils of the Lord&rsquo;s victory, the more we will mount up on these two wings, empowered with the cross and all that God is.</p>
<p>O the enjoyment in the local church! We were desolate, but not now: God has given the desolate a home to dwell in. We were fatherless, we were orphans, but not now; we were widows, but not now. Now we are home, God is our Father, God is our protector. We were in the parched land, we were in the prison, but not now. Now we are in prosperity, now we are in the place of plentiful rain. Now at home with the family we are enjoying all the goodness of the Father. Day by day He loads us with good. O what enjoyment is expressed in this Psalm and experienced in the local church!</p>
<p>The first point is the victory of Christ, the second point is the building up of God&rsquo;s habitation on this earth, and the third point is the enjoyment of God in Christ with all the spoils of His victory in the local church. Psalm 68 is so deep; it is so full of Christ; it has so much concerning God&rsquo;s habitation and God as everything to us for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRAISES</h2>
<p>Now we come to the last main point in this Psalm, the matter of praise. O what praise! There is no natural or religious praise in this Psalm. Sometimes when you go out with your family to the sea or the mountains, you look at the heavens, the sea, the mountains, the flowers or the birds, and say, &ldquo;Lord, how we praise Thee for all these wonderful and beautiful things!&rdquo; This is natural praise. Sometimes at the day&rsquo;s end you call your children together and say, &ldquo;Let us praise and thank the Lord for all His blessings. He has been so kind: He has given us health and kept us from any accident. O Father, how good You are to us!&rdquo; This is religious praise. We cannot find anything natural or religious in the praises of Psalm 68. All the praises in this Psalm are exceedingly deep in the experiences of Christ. My burden here is just this: we must have a thorough, a radical, a one hundred and eighty degree revolution in our praises. We must learn to praise according to Psalm 68. Our praises must match the element and standard of Psalm 68.</p><h2 class="head2">To Him Who Rides on the Storm Clouds</h2>
<p>Firstly we must praise God for Christ&rsquo;s victory. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;Sing unto God, sing praises to His name: triumph in Him that rideth through the deserts [<em>or,</em> upon the storm clouds].&rdquo; Regardless of the storm, regardless of the cloud, God is riding upon them. The storm becomes His throne; the cloud becomes His seat; God is sitting upon them. So we must triumph in Him; we must sing triumphantly and praise His victory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Him Who Has Ascended on High</h2>
<p>In verse 18 there is a tremendous praise: &ldquo;Thou hast ascended on high. Thou hast led captive a train of vanquished foes. Thou hast received gifts in Man, and even for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell with them.&rdquo; Christ has ascended! Hallelujah! How did He ascend? By leading captive a train of vanquished foes. All the enemies have been vanquished; all the enemies have been captured. He ascended to the heavens with a celebration of His victory, a celebrating procession of many foes. He defeated Satan! He defeated all the demons and evil spirits! He defeated all the rebellious people, including you! Have you ever said to Satan, &ldquo;You are a defeated foe; you have been defeated on the cross!&rdquo; Oh, if we have ever seen the victory won by Christ on the cross, we will say, &ldquo;Satan is just a defeated foe!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Him Who Has Given Gifts to the Body</h2>
<p>Christ ascended to the heavens in triumphant victory, and there as man and for man He received gifts from the Father and passed them on to His Body. For what purpose? For the building up of the dwelling place of God. He received gifts in man and for man that God may dwell with them. Paul quoted this verse in Ephesians 4 and said that He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers. He also gave all the members&mdash;every member is a gift to the Body. The two shoulders may be the Apostle John and the Apostle Peter&mdash;these are the great gifts to the Body. Other gifts are also quite useful and beautiful, like our two eyes. Besides these we have lesser gifts like our little fingers, which at times are so comforting and useful. Do you realize how precious and useful you are? Christ needs you and the Body needs you. Even the little members are gifts received from the Father, by Christ, in man, for the church, and given to the church for the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on this earth.</p>
<p>How did the Father give the gifts to the Son and the Son give the gifts to the church? It is not simply that gifts are given and we receive them&mdash;there is much more to it than that. God gave the divine life with the divine nature to His Son Christ; God gave His Holy Spirit to His Son Christ; and God gave all those chosen before the foundation of the world, all the chosen rebels, including you, to His Son Christ. Christ received all this. Then Christ put the divine life into the rebels, Christ put the divine nature into the rebels, and Christ filled these rebels with the Holy Spirit. In so doing, the rebels were transformed into gifts. Saul of Tarsus was such a person, a rebel; but God the Father gave Saul of Tarsus to His Son Christ. We did not observe this, but Christ did&mdash; He saw it and said, &ldquo;Thank You, Father, for such a rebel.&rdquo; That rebel was kicking Jesus, and Christ in the heavens said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Saul, that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; Then the divine life, the divine nature, and the Holy Spirit were put into him. He was reborn, he was converted and transformed, and after a certain time, Saul became Paul, the rebel became an apostle. Such a gift was then given to the church. We were all rebels, but we&rsquo;ve all been chosen. One day the Father gave these miserable rebels to His Son, and one by one the Son put the divine nature into them, regenerated them, transformed them, filled them with the Holy Spirit, and gave them all as gifts to the Body that the church might be built as the habitation of God on this earth. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>How we need to praise and praise and praise out of such a verse as Psalm 68:18.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Women Publishing the Tidings</h2>
<p>Notice verse 11: &ldquo;The Lord sendeth the news of victory: great is the host of women that publish the tidings.&rdquo; The Lord gives the news; the women publish the tidings. The men are the strong ones; the women are the weaker vessels (1 Pet. 3:7). In appearance you may be a man, in name you may be a man, but in reality we are all women; we are all weaker ones. All the publishers are not the strong, but the weak. To accomplish a work, you need strong ones, but to publish the tidings you do not need strong ones. We all must publish the tidings. We cannot do anything, but we can publish the tidings&mdash;we can tell people that Christ is victor, that Christ has ascended and led captive a train of vanquished foes! Hallelujah! We cannot send Christ to the heavens, but we can publish the tidings. I am utterly weak; in reality I am just a woman&mdash;but I can do something, I can publish tidings. The following verse says, &ldquo;The kings of the armies, they flee, they flee!&rdquo; These are the tidings. The enemy is defeated!</p><h2 class="head2">As the Women Dividing the Spoil</h2>
<p>Now notice who it is that divides the spoil: &ldquo;The women that tarry at home...&rdquo; (v. 12). Not the men, but the women; not by toiling, laboring, or fighting, but by tarrying at home. There is no need for us to toil and fight the battle; the battle is over, the victory is already won! We only need come and divide the spoil. Today in the local church, in God&rsquo;s home, we are simply dividing the spoil day by day. On one hand we are publishing the tidings, and on the other hand we are dividing the spoil. Though we are lying among the sheepfolds (v. 13), yet we are dividing the spoils of Christ&rsquo;s victory. You may say that those who lie among the sheepfolds are rather indolent. Yes, but when they get the spoils, the wings of the dove, they will no longer lie among the sheepfolds; they will fly, they will be transcendent.</p>
<p>Whenever you see the victory of Christ, you enjoy the spoils of His victory. Then what is the result? You are strengthened with the wings of a dove, covered with silver and gold. Whenever you share the spoils of Christ&rsquo;s victory, some of the spoils are poured on you. You will have the spiritual strength of the Spirit with all the value of Christ&rsquo;s death and the fulness of God&rsquo;s divine life poured upon you. O what wings you will have! And what power there is in those wings, not to walk, but to fly. The more you enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s victory, the more you will pick up all the enemies. You will say, &ldquo;Aha Satan, aha flesh, the world, and lusts&mdash;you&rsquo;re all under my feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O brothers and sisters, what a basis and content for our praise! When we experience all these things, what an outflowing of praise there will be&mdash;not natural or religious praise, but praise full of the experience of Christ. Could we put all these things into our experiences? You may say that you have a little experience of this kind, but do not know how to utter it. I agree with you&mdash;we are not accustomed to this kind of praise. We are so used to natural and religious praises. We are so accustomed simply to praise and thank the Lord that He loves us and that He died on the cross for us&mdash;all the time it is like this. There is certainly nothing wrong with this kind of praise, but it is so religious. We need something new, something deeper. Firstly we must experience all these things: we must experience the victory of Christ over all His enemies; we must share and partake of the spoils of Christ&rsquo;s victory; we must have the experience of the wings of the dove covered with silver and gold. Then, when we learn how to utter all these experiences, we will praise Christ not in a religious way, but in a new way out of the riches of experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Goings of God</h2>
<p>Now let us go on to verse 24: &ldquo;They have seen Thy goings, O God, the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.&rdquo; By the accomplishments of verse 18, by the gifts received by the ascended One and given by Him to the Body, the habitation of God has been built up. So in verse 24 the enemies, the defeated foes, see the goings of God in the sanctuary. In the habitation God moves; in the habitation you can see the goings of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Praising Procession</h2>
<p>Then in verse 25 we have the praising procession: &ldquo;The singers went before, the players on stringed instruments after, in the midst of maidens playing on timbrels.&rdquo; This procession is made up mainly of maidens, the weaker ones. Psalm 8 deals with praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings; Psalm 68 also deals with praise, but this time by widows, by women, by maidens. In Matthew 14 we are told that the Lord fed five thousand men besides women and children. The women and children are not reckoned. They are not worthy to be reckoned, but they are worthy to praise. To obtain His praises, God does not need the strong ones, the reckoned ones; he needs the unreckoned, the women and the children. If we brothers are not women, we are not qualified. For the praises of God in the church we do not have brothers&mdash;we are all women with the little ones. For praising the Lord, there is no need for us to be strong. Just the weak ones&mdash;the babes, the sucklings, the women and the maidens&mdash;can praise. We are worthy for nothing, but we are worthy for praising. We do not know how to perform, but we know how to praise. All the women must learn how to publish, how to enjoy, and how to praise.</p>
<p>The singers precede and the singers follow, all of them in the midst of maidens playing on timbrels. This is a maiden procession, not a male procession. If we are fighting, we all must be men, but now we are learning to praise, not on the battlefield, but at home in the local church. Here there is no fighting, but praising by enjoying. We enjoy Him and then we praise Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Out of the Experience of Christ as Benjamin</h2>
<p>Now we come to the praise of verse 27, a verse so full of meaning: &ldquo;There is little Benjamin in the lead, the princes of Judah with their company, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.&rdquo; We must learn to praise the Lord not just for His victory, but for all that He Himself is. Praise is a psalm, and psalms are a kind of poetry. In the writings of poetry, figures of speech are used; so in this verse we have figures&mdash;Benjamin, Judah, Zebulun, and Naphtali. These are not plain words; these are figures. There are twelve tribes in Israel, but only four of them are mentioned here. Why did the Psalmist select just these four? It is quite interesting. Today, with the enlightenment of the New Testament, we can see the entire history of Christ in these four figures.</p>
<p>Regarding Benjamin, we must read Genesis 35:18, &ldquo;And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni [the son of my sorrow]: but his father called him Benjamin [the son of the right hand].&rdquo; We have these two titles, these two names, ascribed to Benjamin&mdash;the son of sorrow, and the son of the right hand. The whole human history of Christ is the story of these two names. When He was incarnated, He was incarnated to be a man of sorrows. Isaiah 53 tells us that while Christ was on this earth, He was &ldquo;a man of sorrows&rdquo; (v. 3). The son of sorrow signifies Christ&rsquo;s incarnation and human living on this earth. By His incarnation and by all His human living, He suffered every kind of trial and hardship&mdash;He was really the son of sorrow. But He died and was resurrected, and by His death and resurrection He was made the Son at the right hand of God. Just by this little name of Benjamin we can see the incarnated Christ, the Christ who lived on this earth, who died on the cross, who was resurrected, and who ascended to the heavens as the Son at the right hand of God.</p>
<p>But Benjamin is something more. In the prophecy of Jacob concerning Benjamin in Genesis 49:27 we read, &ldquo;Benjamin... shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.&rdquo; Benjamin was predicted to be such a warrior. The Lord while He was here on earth as the son of sorrow was in a sense very bold in fighting. He was kind to the miserable human beings, but he was exceedingly bold to His enemies. He was a warrior on this earth: He fought the battle and devoured the prey; He won the victory on the cross and got all the spoils. This is why He became in His ascension the Son of the right hand of God. Benjamin signifies all the life of Christ in His humanity and in His victory.</p><h2 class="head2">Out of the Experience of Christ as Judah</h2>
<p>Following Benjamin we have Judah. In the Bible, Benjamin always goes with Judah. When the people of Israel were divided, only Benjamin stood with Judah as the southern nation. In some cases Benjamin fought the battle with Judah. They were always together.</p>
<p>In Genesis 49:8-10 Jacob predicted the following: &ldquo;Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father&rsquo;s children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion&rsquo;s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion... the sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.&rdquo; In Revelation 5:5 the Lord is referred to as the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Thus, the greatest sign of Judah is that of the conquering Lion. This conquering Lion was worshipped in the heavens according to Revelation 5, and not only worshipped but enthroned and crowned with authority. The scepter signifies royal authority. He is the King of kings! After His ascension, Christ was worshipped as the conquering Lion and enthroned with royal authority as the King of kings. He is in that position today. What about the future? In the future He will be Shiloh, the maker of peace. This refers to His second coming: He is coming as Shiloh to bring peace to the entire earth.</p>
<p>Just with these two names we have the history of Christ from His incarnation to His second coming. Benjamin signifies Him from His incarnation to His ascension, including all the victory He has gained. Judah signifies Christ from His ascension, His enthronement and glorification to His coming back. This is all for our praise; we must learn to praise in the meetings about all these things. We need many little Benjamins; we need many Judahs in our praises in the meetings. Where are they? In all our meetings we must learn to praise with a high standard, to praise God with little Benjamin and with Judah and their company.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Out of the Experience of Christ<br />
as Zebulun and Naphtali</h2>
<p>Then what about Zebulun and Naphtali? It is indeed interesting. The Bible always puts Benjamin together with Judah, and the Bible also puts Zebulun together with Naphtali. Let us look again at Jacob&rsquo;s prophecy regarding the tribes of Israel. Concerning Zebulun he said, &ldquo;Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships&rdquo; (Gen. 49:13). In other words, Zebulun will be a seaport, a harbor for ships. What is the meaning of this? This signifies transportation, communication&mdash;the preaching, the spreading. The local church is a haven of ships.</p>
<p>Concerning Naphtali Jacob prophesied in this way: &ldquo;Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly [beautiful] words&rdquo; (Gen. 49:21). Psalm 18:33 shows that the hind is one who runs exceedingly fast. Naphtali is a released hind&mdash;this is the speed for preaching. With Naphtali there are also the beautiful words. Matthew 4 tells us that when the Lord Jesus came, He began His preaching from Galilee. In the day of the Lord Jesus Galilee was formed of these very tribes, Zebulun and Naphtali. Matthew 4:15 says, &ldquo;The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.&rdquo; Even the Lord Himself, in a sense, was a Galilean. Moreover, all the first group of disciples who preached the Gospel, according to Acts 1:11, were called &ldquo;men of Galilee.&rdquo; What is the meaning of this? When we put all these things together, they signify that this Christ who was incarnated, who lived on this earth, who died and was resurrected, who ascended and was enthroned, who is the conqueror and the King of kings, and who is coming again as the Shiloh, is being propagated to the uttermost parts of the earth. This very Christ is now being preached and spread swiftly all over the earth with beautiful words. He is a Christ in propagation, a Christ to be spread to the uttermost. O what a Christ we have! This is the Christ in poetry. This poetry is so simple; yet when we get into it, we see the profound significance held by these few words.</p>
<p>What is the Holy Spirit indicating to us now? In the praises of the church there should be the element of Benjamin, the element of Judah, and the element of Zebulun and Naphtali. We have to praise God with all these elements. In our praising procession we need Benjamin, Judah, Zebulun and Naphtali. In the deeper praises offered to God there must be the real experience of Christ as Benjamin, the real experience of Christ as Judah, and the real experience of Christ as Zebulun and Naphtali. This is the way we must praise in the church. Forget about yourself, your sickness, your healing, and all the material blessings you have received. Look at Christ with all the elements of Benjamin, Judah, Zebulun and Naphtali. This praise is much higher in standard than that of Psalm 19.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ENEMIES REBUKED FROM HIS TEMPLE</h2>
<p>At the end of the Psalm God rebukes His enemies from His temple (vv. 29, 30). In verses 21, 22, and 23, God says that He will smite the head of the enemies and bring them again from the depth of the Red Sea that we may dip our feet in their blood. Not only may we share this victory, but even our dogs may partake of it. O what a victory! Today in the church He has already won the victory. We must enjoy it. If we don&rsquo;t believe He has defeated the Egyptian army and buried them in the depths of the sea, He will bring them again to us and let us crush them to demonstrate His victory. This is poetry for our experience and praise.</p>
<p>Oh, may the Lord revolutionize our praises! May He give our praises the content of such a Psalm as this&mdash;praises for such a glorious victory and praises for such a glorious Christ in all His Person and accomplishments. Then we will have a proper meeting.</p>

<p class="hbody-hymn">(Tune #149 in <em>Hymns</em>)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BY PRAISING THROUGH<br />
OUR EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</h1>
<p>In the book of Hebrews we are told mainly that the Lord Jesus today is in the heavens as the great High Priest, interceding for us continually. But in the same book there is another aspect of His ministry. While He is there in the heavens interceding for us, He is also here in the midst of the church singing hymns of praise to the Father. He is there, and He is here; He is there interceding for us, and He is here with us praising the Father. We should be able to say with the Apostle Paul, &ldquo;It is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20, ASV). We should also be able to say, &ldquo;It is no longer I that sing, but Christ singeth in me.&rdquo; He and we are one. He as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) indwells our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), and we are one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17); so when we sing from our spirit, He sings within our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE PASSAGES IN HEBREWS<br />
CONCERNING MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. The Lord Singing&mdash;Hebrews 2:12</h2>
<p>Of all the epistles in the New Testament, there are only two dealing with the matter of Christian meetings: the first, which we have already considered, is the book of 1 Corinthians; the second is the book of Hebrews. There are three passages in the book of Hebrews which we must see concerning meetings. When we collect them and put them together, we get the concept of the writer regarding Christian meetings. The first is the passage we have already referred to in chapter two, verse 12, saying that in the midst of the church the Lord Jesus sings hymns of praise. We must realize that the church here means the church meeting together&mdash;that is quite apparent. If there were no meeting of the church, how could the Lord Jesus sings hymns of praise in the midst of the church? The word &ldquo;midst&rdquo; indicates that the church is coming together; so this is the church meeting. This is a deeper way for us to meet together&mdash;by the Lord Jesus singing in us.</p>
<p>So many of us were born and brought up in Christianity. When we were there, the choir did the singing. Do you think the Lord Jesus could sing hymns of praise there? But that is still a kind of Christian meeting. The problem is that they meet in a superficial way, a formal way, a wrong way; they frustrate the Lord Jesus and hinder His singing in the meeting of the church. When I was young I knew of a kind of Christian meeting in which people rolled on the ground&mdash;they were called the holy rollers; others stood in the corner laughing&mdash;they were called the holy laughers; and some were continually jumping&mdash;they were the holy jumpers. To my realization it would be rather difficult for the Lord Jesus to sing hymns of praise there. The meetings we need, the proper meetings, are those in which the Lord Jesus is able to sing hymns of praise. This one matter will adjust us greatly. Do we have the assurance that whenever we come together, there is no frustration to Him singing in us? We must be assured that while we are singing, He is singing in our singing. This is tremendously meaningful. You may insist that such and such a way is the proper way for Christians to meet. Superficially speaking, you may be right; but let me check with you: while you are singing, is the Lord Jesus singing within your singing? If you do not have this assurance, your way of meeting is undoubtedly improper. At least it is not adequate. This passage of the Word is the strongest test to our way of meeting. If we do have the proper and adequate way to meet, we should have the certainty deep within us that when we are singing, when we are praising, the Lord Jesus is singing and praising within us. This matter must adjust and correct us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. Saints Meeting&mdash;Hebrews 10:25</h2>
<p>The second passage regarding meetings in this book is in chapter ten, verse 25: &ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is...&rdquo; We need to have a habit of meeting; we need to build up a meeting habit. But, I would ask, if we have the habit of meeting, what do we have the habit of doing in our meetings? Do we occupy the entire time with ministry, prophecy, exhortation, teaching, etc.? Then how could the Lord Jesus sing the hymns of praise in the church? Do you see my point? Chapter ten, verse 25, indicates that when we come together we should exhort or encourage one another, and so much the more as the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming draws nigh. But we must put the passages of this one book together. If we isolate this verse in chapter ten of Hebrews, we may say that we should come together just for mutual encouragement. But if we put the passage in chapter two, verse 12, together with this, we will see that we should come together mainly to praise.</p><h2 class="head2">3. Praising through Him&mdash;Hebrews 13:15</h2>
<p>Now let us go on to the last passage in this book regarding Christian meetings&mdash;chapter thirteen, verse 15. This is the last instruction in this book. &ldquo;Through him (note the change from &lsquo;by him&rsquo; to &lsquo;through him,&rsquo; which is the proper translation) therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips confessing His name.&rdquo; (Note, the proper translation should be &ldquo;confessing his name,&rdquo; not &ldquo;giving thanks to his name.&rdquo;) After thirteen chapters full of instructions, here is the final instruction. &ldquo;Through him.&rdquo; Do not miss these two words, &ldquo;through him.&rdquo; Through whom? You may say through Jesus Christ. Yes, but who is Jesus Christ? You must read the book of Hebrews several times before you can answer this question. The answer is not so simple. All thirteen chapters of this book simply tell us who Jesus is. Let us consider briefly in the light of this book who Jesus is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JESUS IN HEBREWS</h2>
<p>Chapter one tells us that Jesus is one with divinity: He is called the Son of God, and He is even God Himself. Chapter two tells us that Jesus is a real man, yet a man who is now crowned with glory and honor. Such a man who has been tested by so many sufferings is today our great High Priest. In chapter three we have more items of what this Jesus is. He is the Apostle sent to us by God, and the High Priest going to God for us. He came as the Apostle, and He went as the High Priest. We could go on to look at many more items in chapters four, five, six, seven, and eight, etc. There is something in every chapter. Oh, this Jesus, this wonderful Jesus! So this word, &ldquo;through him,&rdquo; in chapter thirteen has immense significance. It means that you have experienced Him, that you have passed through Him, through the Jesus of all thirteen chapters of this superlative book. Without being &ldquo;through him&rdquo; your praises to God can never be acceptable and are meaningless. We must give our praises &ldquo;through him.&rdquo; In other words, your praise must be composed through Him, must be composed with Him, and must be constituted with the experiences of Him. You enjoy Him as the One mentioned in chapter one, you enjoy Him as the One in chapter two, you experience and pass through Him as the One revealed in chapter three, and so forth. Then you have many letters and words of Christ; you have a vocabulary, not just in your mentality, but in your experience, from which you may compose praise to the Father. This is the right meaning of &ldquo;through him.&rdquo; Through Him you offer your praises to the Father. This is the fruit of your lips, confessing His name. We confess His name not by preaching or teaching, but by praising.</p>
<p>Put these three passages together: 1) Christ is in the midst of the church, singing hymns of praise to the Father; 2) we must not neglect to come together, we must have a meeting habit; and 3) through Him we must offer praises to God. When we conjoin these three passages, we get the proper concept of Christian meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING MAINLY FOR PRAISING</h2>
<p>I am expecting and looking to the Lord that one day in our meetings three-fourths of the time will be for praising and one-fourth left for prophesying. You may say that that is too much time for praise, but I hope that it will be so much. Whenever we come together we must be full of praise and most of the time praising. You may ask, what about encouraging one another, what about exhorting? Should we just praise without exhorting or encouraging? I tell you, the proper praising is the best exhortation, the best encouragement. If someone stands up to exhort me, I am not so deeply impressed. But if they sing praises from the spirit, if the Lord Jesus sings in their singing, that is a real exhortation, a real encouragement to me. Do you not agree? The real edifying, the real building up of the church is in the praising. If we would and if we could praise adequately and properly so that the Lord Jesus could continually sing hymns in our singing, the church would be wonderfully encouraged and built up. This is why the Apostle Paul lists psalms as the first item mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Singing and praising must be on the top. We must consider praising the first item we need in the meetings of the church.</p>
<p>In the beginning of this book it says that the Lord Jesus sings praises to the Father in the midst of the church. Then at the end we are told that we must offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually through Him. Between these two passages we have the verse in chapter ten telling us that we must build up a meeting habit. By these three passages we are abundantly clear that whenever we meet there must be the possibility of the Lord Jesus singing praises to the Father, and whenever we come together we must be praising, not talking, witnessing or prophesying so much, but praising&mdash;praising through Him.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEING JESUS</h2>
<p>The entire book of Hebrews teaches that Christ is better than so many things: Christ is better than Judaism and any kind of religion; Christ is better than this and better than that; Christ is all the best things&mdash;this is the book of Hebrews. But this book, while it tells how Christ is better than so many things, also tells and encourages us to enjoy such a Christ, not just to know Him, but to experience Him.</p>
<p>Sometimes the small words in the Bible are intensely meaningful. I really like these three words, &ldquo;We see Jesus&rdquo; (Heb. 2:9). Do you realize what it means to see Jesus? This is not just knowledge, not just understanding; this is seeing&mdash;we see Jesus. We see! What kind of Jesus do we see? We see Jesus who is God incarnated, who is made a little man, lower than the angels. He was not such a great man, but a small man, a despised man. We see Him! We see His human living on the earth, His sufferings, His death. We see Jesus! But we also see Him crowned with glory and honor! This should not simply be a kind of doctrine, but a seeing. Have you seen Jesus incarnated, Jesus suffering, Jesus crucified, Jesus resurrected from the dead, Jesus ascended to the heavens, glorified, crowned, and enthroned? If you have really seen these things today, how could you keep yourself silent when you come to the meeting?</p>
<p>Those who go to the football games are intensely excited. Why? Because they see something. The wife tells the husband, and the husband tells the wife; the son tells the father, and the father tells the son. When you see, you cannot be silent. Why do you come to the meetings so silently? Why must the leading brothers spend so much time and energy encouraging you to open your mouth? Because you have not seen. You have not seen Jesus. If you have seen Jesus today, it is absolutely impossible to remain silent in the meeting. This is the way for us to meet&mdash;we have to see Jesus. We cannot just quote a verse such as Hebrews 10:25, saying that we must not neglect coming together. Even if we come together, what shall we do? If we are so empty, if we are void of seeing Jesus, we will simply burden one another when we come to the meetings. If we are encouraged to function in the meetings, we will have nothing to say; we will have nothing to stir up the spirits of others. The meeting will simply fall flat. Suppose you have never seen a game of football; yet when you come together you try to talk and others encourage you to talk about football. What a miserable performance! Suppose, however, we have all just seen an exciting game&mdash;when we come together, everyone will have a lot to say. Several will be speaking at once, and you will have a hard time trying to stop us. O brothers, this is the way we should meet. But the subject is Jesus; we have seen Jesus! Oh, what a Jesus!</p>
<p>Many years ago, I was quite foolish; I used to force people to function. I was helped by the teaching regarding the universal priesthood to realize that every believer must function in the meeting. I told the brothers they all must function, and I even went so far as to ask them to sign a paper, promising how many times in the meetings they would pray or give a testimony. That frightened the people. Some were so frightened that they quit coming. Now I do not ask people to sign a paper, but I do say that if we would have a proper meeting, we must see Jesus, we must have the real experience of the Jesus revealed in this book. If we see this Jesus, we will be beside ourselves. If we neglect the seeing of Jesus, even though we come to the meeting, we will not function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING CHRIST IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In chapter two we are told that this Jesus is the sanctifying One, and we are those to be sanctified. He and we are of one Father with one life; so He is not ashamed to call us brethren. Christ is our Brother, and we are His brethren. Just to see this one item is tremendous. In chapter three we are told that we are partakers of the heavenly calling and partakers of Christ. He is the Apostle, the One sent from God to us, and He is the High Priest, the One going to God from us. Consider Him and partake of Him, partake of the Apostle, partake of the High Priest, partake of Christ. O how good is this term, &ldquo;the partakers of Christ.&rdquo; If we do enjoy Christ in this way, what a meeting we will have!</p>
<p>In chapter four we are told there is a rest remaining for us, and we must labor to enter into that rest. We know that is the good land, which is the full type of Christ. Christ is the good land as our rest. So many Christians are like the wandering Israelites in the wilderness: they do not have rest because they do not have the practical experience of Christ as everything to them. They have not entered into the good land; so there is no rest for them. Yet this rest is remaining for us. How can we enter in? The way is in verse 12: our soul must be divided from our spirit. When we are in the soul, we are just in the wilderness. It is not till we turn ourselves to the spirit, till we get into the spirit, that we are immediately in the good land, the holiest of all. We all must learn to discern our spirit from our soul that we may enter into Christ and enjoy all that He is to us. This is the base, the foundation for our meeting. If in our daily walk we do not know how to divide the spirit from the soul, how to discern our spirit and how to be in the spirit, we can never enjoy Christ as our rest and as our good land. Then when we come to the meeting, we are void of Christ, and it is impossible for us to have a proper meeting. I hope that all these words will not be just a teaching to you. The way to enter into the real enjoyment of Christ is to discern our spirit from our soul. Then when we come together, we will come with a rich surplus of Christ. Spontaneously, we will sing His praises, and while we are singing, He will be singing within our singing. This is the proper way for us to meet.</p>
<p>When we are in the spirit enjoying Christ as the good land, it is rather difficult to tell others whether we are on earth or in the heavens. We have a deep ecstasy that we are mostly in the heavens, touching the throne of grace, obtaining mercy and finding grace for the timely need (Heb. 4:16). When we are in such an enjoyment, we can hardly wait to get into the meeting hall to shout and sing; we will be singing and praising all the way. Do not try simply to do this in an outward way&mdash;that is a kind of performance, that is not real. We must see Jesus. Have you seen Jesus? Oh, our High Priest is able to sympathize with all our infirmities! I will never be bothered by my weakness with such a One. Hallelujah, I am in the heavens! When I get into my spirit, I am just in the heavens, touching the throne of grace.</p>
<p>Most writings on the book of Hebrews are simply doctrinal, saying that Jesus is better than the angels, better than Moses, better than Joshua, and better than this and that&mdash; mere terminology. The one written by Andrew Murray on this book, entitled &ldquo;The Holiest of All,&rdquo; is an exception; it speaks much concerning our experience. In the book of Hebrews the author frequently tells us that we must experience what he is saying. We all must experience what is revealed in this book about Christ.</p>
<p>In chapter ten we are told that we have boldness to enter into the holiest of all by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way which He has made for us through the veil (Heb. 10:19-20). &ldquo;Hallelujah, Hallelujah! We have passed the riven veil&mdash;here the glories never fail.&rdquo; This is not just a song; this is something bubbling up and overflowing from within. Psalm 45:1 says, &ldquo;My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter...&rdquo; (ASV). This means that within me something is bubbling up. It is not a performance, but a bubbling, so that my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. He who bubbled up in Psalm 45 was one who saw the wonderful things of the King: he could not help himself. We all need the experience of Psalm 45 and Psalm 68. If we do not have this experience, regardless of how loud we shout, we do not have the ecstasy and we do not have the response in the spirit. We need to come to the throne of grace, to enter into the holiest of all with boldness by the blood, by the new and living way through the veil. Hallelujah!</p><h2 class="head1">GOING FORTH UNTO HIM</h2>
<p>In chapter twelve, verse 2, we have, &ldquo;Looking unto Jesus...&rdquo; It really means, &ldquo;Looking away unto Jesus.&rdquo; Oh, let us look away from so many other things unto Jesus. Look away unto Jesus&mdash;not just see Him, but look unto Him. In chapter thirteen, verse 13, we read, &ldquo;Let us go forth therefore unto Him...&rdquo; Just to see Him is not enough; just to look unto Him is not sufficient; just to consider Him is also not adequate. Finally, we must go forth unto Jesus. &ldquo;Let us go forth therefore unto Him without the camp, bearing His reproach.&rdquo; Jesus today is not in the camp; He is outside. What is the camp? The camp is a religious organization; the camp here typically means Judaism, the Jewish religion. When the Israelites worshipped the golden calf while Moses was on Mount Sinai, they immediately became a religious camp in the eyes of God. Moses at that time moved out of the camp to be with the Lord, and everyone who sought the Lord went unto the Lord without the camp (Exo. 33:7). This is the historical fact referred to here. The book of Hebrews was written to the Hebrew believers who were still so much for Judaism. They did not realize that Judaism in the eyes of God had become a camp forsaking God and worshipping idols. Jesus was not there; Jesus is not in any religious organization. Jesus today is outside the camp; we must go forth unto Him without the camp. In no other way could we be one with Him. Where He is, there we must be.</p>
<p>Through Him, through such a One, we offer our praises to God. Do you see the point? Suppose that at the very opening of Hebrews we had this word, &ldquo;Through Him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise...&rdquo; We would all ask, &ldquo;Through whom?&rdquo; But this word is not at the beginning, nor in the middle, but at the end, after all the riches of this Christ have been revealed. Through such a One whom you have experienced, whom you have enjoyed so much, offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually. The real praise in the meetings must be constituted of our experiences of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAISING THE FATHER BY PRAISING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Father does not like us to praise Him directly. The sweetest praises we can offer to the Father are those we offer to Christ and which concern Christ&mdash;there is nothing more pleasant to the Father&rsquo;s heart than this. There is an entirely mistaken concept in Christianity regarding worship to God: that to prostrate ourselves and bow down to the Father in heaven is real worship. No, that is not real worship. Real worship to the Father is the handling of His Son. In Gospel preaching we tell the sinners that Christ is the Son of God, that Christ is the very One who redeemed us, the One who can save us and bring us to the Father. If we minister these things regarding Christ to the unbelievers, this is real worship to the Father. To worship the Father, to worship God, is simply to present the Son of God. Either we present Christ to the Father or we present Christ to others in the Father&rsquo;s presence&mdash;both are the best worship we can render to God. Real praise to the Father is not merely that we come to Him and say, &ldquo;O Father, how great Thou art. Thou art so righteous, so holy, so high, so kind and so good!&rdquo; If we merely praise the Father in this way, we are rather religious. The real praises to the Father come out of our experience of Christ in our daily life as the little Benjamin, as Judah, as Zebulun and Naphtali (Psa. 68:27). If we come to the meeting and say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, Jesus is my Lord; He is the little Benjamin,&rdquo; it seems that this is not praise to the Father. But I tell you, this is a very pleasing praise to the Father, gladdening and rejoicing His heart. The Father never desires that we merely glorify Him, but rather that we glorify Him with the Son. If we glorify the Son, we glorify the Father. If we glorify the Son, the Father will say, &ldquo;I am glorified in my Son being glorified by you.&rdquo; Learn to praise in this way, not to praise with a composition of religious and natural things. The praises out of our experience and enjoyment of Christ, the spiritual praises to the Lord about Christ, are the best praise to the Father.</p>
<p>For many years we have been trying to free ourselves from the way of meeting in today&rsquo;s Christianity, but we have not succeeded. In these days, however, the Lord is showing us the way&mdash;that is, we all must experience Christ, we all must see Jesus; then when we come together we will have something so exciting to share of Him. This is the proper meeting, and this meeting will be mostly for praising.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">WITH CHRIST-FILLED PRAISES</h1>
<p>Only three books in all of the New Testament deal with the matter of meeting. We have seen that Matthew, the first book of these three, tells us that we must meet in the name of the Lord Jesus (18:20). This means that we must meet in the Spirit, for the reality of the Lord&rsquo;s name is the Spirit. Then in 1 Corinthians, as we have seen, the first of all the items listed as functions in the meeting is a psalm (14:26). In other words, praising is the first among all the things we need in the meetings. For the meetings we must learn not just how to sing, but how to <em>sing praises.</em> The third book, the book of Hebrews, tells us that we should not forsake the meetings. The Christian life or the church life is a meeting life; if we do not have the meetings, it is impossible to have the church life. In this book we see also that the way for us to meet is by praising, and the way for us to praise is by the Lord Jesus singing hymns of praise unto the Father in the midst of our meeting. When we really sing praises to the Father in the spirit, Christ sings within us. The Lord Jesus today as the life-giving Spirit is indwelling our spirit and is one with our spirit. Unless we sing in the spirit, the Lord has no way to sing.</p>
<p>The best way to meet, therefore, is to praise with Christ singing in our praising. The Lord has shown us that after such a long book as the book of Hebrews, the last counsel we are given is that we all must praise. But the word is not so simple: it says, &ldquo;Through Him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God...&rdquo; &ldquo;Through Him therefore...&rdquo; &ldquo;Therefore&rdquo; here is not a small word. Many things have been mentioned, many things concerning the riches of Christ have been unveiled; &ldquo;therefore...&rdquo; Since we have been made partakers of Christ, since we have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, since we have enjoyed Christ so much; <em>therefore,</em> let us offer the sacrifice of our praise. It does not say, &ldquo;Let us offer praise,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Let us offer the sacrifice of praise.&rdquo; There is something within our praise as a sacrifice unto God. It is so strong; it is Christ-filled praise after Christ-filled praise unto God, confessing His name.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAISING IN A NEW LANGUAGE</h2>
<p>Many of us have been Christians for years and have heard many prayers and praises in the so-called Christian churches. When I recall these praises, I can only say, &ldquo;How poor!&rdquo; How very little of Christ there was in those praises, and even less of the experience of Christ. When I was young I heard a pastor begin his prayer in this way: &ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy, O God, the God of Holiness...&rdquo; I was deeply impressed and thought it was a marvelous prayer. But when I recall it now, I can only say, &ldquo;How poor! There is no little Benjamin, no Judah, no Zebulun and Naphtali.&rdquo; There is almost nothing of Christ there, and there is no experience of Christ.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of, &ldquo;Through Him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God&rdquo;? It means that we must pass through Christ, we must experience Him, we must partake of Him and enjoy Him in order to have the adequate praises of Him. Then what we will have as praise to the Father will not be according to our nature or any religious concept, but something composed from the subjective experiences of Christ. In the praises of today&rsquo;s Christians it is really difficult to hear anything concerning the experiences and enjoyment of Christ. In the praise of Psalm 68 so much is said regarding Christ in figurative language. If we praised Christ today in the language of Psalm 68, with &ldquo;little Benjamin, Judah, Zebulun and Naphtali,&rdquo; we would sound to others as if we were speaking in a foreign language. If we entered a Christian service today and began to say, &ldquo;O praise the Lord, here is Benjamin, the son of sorrow, the son of the right hand! Oh, the conquering lion, the scepter, Hallelujah!&rdquo; people would say, &ldquo;Where did he come from? What is he talking about?&rdquo; Is this kind of praise strange to you? In these days we have prayed, &ldquo;Oh, make the church in Los Angeles a haven of ships. Make us all a hind set loose. Oh, the beautiful words of Naphtali! Oh, the men of Galilee! Oh, make us all men of Galilee.&rdquo; Now we all can follow.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT TEACHING BUT PRAISING</h2>
<p>I earnestly hope that the Lord will one day bring His church to spend more time for praising and less for teaching. I do not have much trust in teaching. Today&rsquo;s Christianity is full of teachings, yet it is so poor. The more teachings we have, the more problems will arise and divisions occur. All the divisions are based upon doctrinal matters. Do you think we could be divided by praising? I tell you, the more we say Hallelujah, the more we will be united. It is exceedingly easy to be divided in the mind, but in the spirit it is so easy to be one in Christ.</p>
<p>In the United States there are many, many Christian book stores. There are certainly thousands upon thousands of Christian books&mdash;good books, sound books, fundamental and spiritual books. I have traveled widely throughout this country and have noticed in nearly every Christian home many books&mdash; books about the Bible, Christ, and the Christian life. Some had read through the books concerning the subjective work of the cross. But that cross was just in their mind; that cross did not cross out their mind. It was just a matter of knowledge to them, not of life. Christianity today is full of knowledge and teaching. How many expositions there are on Romans and other epistles! But where is the life, the power, and the impact? If we would spend as much time in praising as we have for teaching, how powerful we would be! If we would learn to praise more and more, we would have the impact and we would have the oneness. The more we discuss on the basis of knowledge and doctrine, the more we will be divided, but the more we praise together, the more we will be one.</p>
<p>The Lord must recover the matter of praise. Sometimes just the singing of a hymn as praise to the Lord will edify people more than a message. The message mainly touches the mind, but the singing, the praising, touches the spirit. The best edification, the best comfort, and the best encouragement are all in the singing of praises. The best weapon for us to fight the battle is praise. When we begin to sing and to praise, God sends the help. But to have this kind of meeting, a meeting with Christ singing within our singing, we need the adequate experiences of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RICHES OF CHRIST IN HEBREWS</h2>
<p>I wish again in a simple way to point out to you the riches of Christ unveiled in this book of Hebrews. It is a book of Christ as so many better things, things which we must know in a way of experience and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Chapter one tells us that this Christ is the Son of God; He is even God Himself, far better than the angels. He is such a Christ. Chapter two tells us that this One, the very God, was made the Son of man, a real man, who for a little while was lower than the angels for the suffering of death. He partook of our nature; He made Himself the same as we. Now He is crowned with glory and honor; yet He is still here on earth, moving and singing in the midst of the church; He is still here with God&rsquo;s children; He is still here putting His trust in the Father. He is the very God, and He is a real man. As the Son of God, He is there today on the throne at the right hand of God. As the real man, He is here today in the midst of the church among the children of God.</p>
<p>Then chapter three tells us that such a One, so qualified as God and as man, is the Apostle sent from God to us. He is much better than Moses; He is our better Moses. With the double qualification of the divine and human natures, He is the Sent One from God, not only taking the lead among us, but building us together as the house of God. We all have been made partakers of this One. The word &ldquo;partakers&rdquo; in verse 14 of this chapter has another meaning in Greek: it means partakers, but it also means companions. On one hand Christ is our enjoyment; so we are partakers of Him. But on the other hand He is our companion, helping us to enter into the enjoyment. On the one hand He is the good land, and on the other hand He is Joshua, the companion of Caleb, helping Caleb to enter the land. Therefore, we are not only His partakers, but also His partners, His companions. He is not only our enjoyment, but also our companion, helping us to enter into the enjoyment. We need to experience all these things.</p>
<p>Chapter four tells us that He is our real Joshua. The word &ldquo;Joshua&rdquo; is a Hebrew title, which when translated into Greek is Jesus. The name Jesus is exactly equivalent to Joshua. Christ is our real Joshua, the One who brings us into rest, the One who brings us into the good land which is Himself. He is the good land, and this good land is in our spirit; so we must discern our spirit from our soul. We should no longer live in the soul; as long as we are in the soul we are in the wilderness. When we turn to the spirit, we are in the good land, the Holiest of all. Here is the very Christ whom we enjoy. He is the ark and He is the good land, and He is also Joshua who brings us into the good land.</p>
<p>From the end of chapter four to the end of chapter seven there are more than three chapters telling us that Christ is the high priest, better than Aaron. He is a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec. He is able to sympathize with us; He can and He does care for all our needs. Therefore, we have the boldness to come to the throne of grace to obtain mercy and find grace to meet the timely need. He is a high priest who continually ministers the riches of God to us just as Melchisedec ministered the bread and wine to Abraham. He is continually interceding for us, and He is able to save us to the uttermost. He ministers Himself to us not according to the letters of the law, but according to the power of an endless life. He is such a priest!</p>
<p>From chapter eight through chapter ten, verse 18, we are told that the new covenant formed by Christ is much better than the old. Christ is the Mediator of this covenant, the Performer of this covenant, and the Testator of this covenant, the One who gives this covenant as a testament to us. He is the Executor of this testament, this will, and He is also the very sacrifice which made it possible. This covenant is so high, so rich, so much more excellent than the old. He is such a One with such a covenant, and now we all have been made partakers of Him. Where is He? The Holy Spirit today is the very reality of this wonderful One. To be made partakers of Him means that we have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, the reality of Christ. Now day by day we partake of this Spirit, the Spirit of grace (10:29).</p><h2 class="head1">PRAISING BY TASTING</h2>
<p>We all must taste this heavenly gift, we all must taste the good Word of God, we all must taste the power of the age to come, though we have not entered into that age (6:4, 5). Some versions use the word &ldquo;tasted,&rdquo; and some &ldquo;tasting.&rdquo; In a sense we have tasted, but we are still tasting. Some say the heavenly gift is this, and some say it is that, but the book of Hebrews does not say this or that; it just says the heavenly gift. The heavenly gift is something heavenly in contrast with earthly things. This is a book written to Jewish believers, to people who were so concerned for earthly things. The writer says that they have tasted something heavenly, something with the nature of the heavens. They have not just received this gift, they have tasted it. Haven&rsquo;t you tasted something heavenly? Perhaps it is eternal life, heavenly peace and rest, or a kind of comfort and inner strengthening. We all have tasted something heavenly. Hallelujah, we have tasted! We have tasted the heavenly gift through pray-reading. By pray-reading, the Word becomes so tasteful to us. If you merely read the Word with your mentality, it may be sweet, but it could never be so sweet as it is by pray-reading. The more you pray-read, the more you taste and enjoy the tasting of the heavenly gift. The good Word here is not the Word as established doctrine, but the living Word, the up-to-date Word. It is the living Word that meets the need of the present time, and it is something for us to taste, not just to know or learn. Infants know very little, but they taste a great deal. They taste many things without knowing what they are. I hope that we all may taste more than we know. If so, we will be filled with experiences which are so adequate and suitable for composing praises to God about Christ. Christ is the sacrifice in our praise, not in an objective way, but in a subjective way. Who can stop us from bubbling over like the Psalmist in Psalm 45:1 when we are so full, not with knowledge in the head, but with experience in the spirit. We will be filled with praises not only in the meetings, but also in our daily life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAISES&mdash;THE CREAM OF OUR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>Psalms and hymns are like the cream of the milk. If you do not have milk, you can never have cream. The cream comes from the milk, the milk comes from the cattle, the cattle feed on the grass, and the grass grows on the ranges. So we need the range to grow the grass, the grass to feed the cattle, the cattle to produce the milk, and then from the milk we get the cream&mdash;the psalms, hymns and songs. Do not think that to write a hymn is so easy. A proper hymn can never be composed by mental knowledge; it is the cream of the experiences of Christ. The church is the ranch: much grass is growing there and we have many cattle feeding all the day. The cattle produce the milk, and out of the milk we have the cream, the praises. If we would have adequate praises, we need the adequate experiences of Christ. We need the ranch, we need the grass, and we need so many living cattle feeding on the grass to produce the milk. Then we will have an abundance of praise. If you are void of Christ in your experiences, it is impossible to offer praise when you come to the meetings; you are simply flat and empty. If you experience Him daily, if you are filled with the subjective experiences of the sweet enjoyment of Christ, you will have the milk, and out of the milk it is so easy to obtain the cream. When you come to the meeting, and even while you are coming, you will be singing, &ldquo;Hallelujah, Hallelujah, praise the Lord! Oh, little Benjamin! Oh, the man who was lower than the angels and crowned with glory and honor! Oh, Judah, the conquering lion!&rdquo; You will be singing all the way. You will certainly make a joyful noise.</p>
<p>The proper way for us to meet is with the cream of praises which issue from the adequate experiences and enjoyment of Christ. It is not a matter of learning, knowledge, sound teachings or scriptural doctrines.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE SPIRIT BY PRAISING</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus said to the Jewish leaders in John chapter five, &ldquo;Ye search the scriptures...and ye will not come to me, that ye may have life&rdquo; (vv. 39-40, ASV). Undoubtedly there is no teaching better than the Bible. But even the Bible can be just the written code which kills. Who crucified the Lord Jesus? The Jewish leaders who knew the Old Testament so well. They knew all the doctrines; they not only searched, but researched the Scriptures; yet they would not come to the living Christ for life. The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. What we need today is the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>I do not say that we have no need whatever of proper teachings. But I do say that we need to be balanced: we need a sound mind and a strong spirit. The mind needs to be taught, but more than that, the spirit needs to be strengthened. We need the strengthening in our inner man, our spirit. This is the urgent, desperate need today. We are not today in the age of doctrine, but the age of the Spirit. What the church needs today is the living Spirit, the life-giving Spirit. And the best way to enjoy this Spirit is to praise. Learn to praise, learn to sing the praises; then you will be filled with the Holy Spirit, and we will have the proper meetings with the rich enjoyment of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">A BETTER CHRIST FOR A BETTER PRAISE</h1>
<p>There is still more concerning the riches of Christ in this book of Hebrews which we must see. To enter into the concept of any writer is not easy, and to get into the spirit of those who wrote the Scriptures is even more difficult. You may know all the passages word for word, you may understand all the sentences and know all the chapters, but it is not so easy to get into the spirit in which such a book was written. I do believe that in these days, however, the Lord has brought us into the spirit of the author of Hebrews. What is the spirit and what is the concept by which, for which and with which the writer composed this book? I do believe that before the writer of the book of Hebrews began his task there was in him this concept: so many Hebrew believers were ensnared by the outward religion, Judaism.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELEMENTS OF JUDAISM</h2>
<p>Judaism was really and undoubtedly good&mdash;in it were the true God, God&rsquo;s law, God&rsquo;s words, God&rsquo;s writings. There may be thousands of books on earth, but not one written by God. However, in Judaism is found God&rsquo;s Holy Writing, God&rsquo;s divine Word. How wonderful this is! Also found in Judaism are the way to worship God, the sacrifices, the offerings, and all the ordinances established by God. This is far removed from heathendom; this was something ordained, revealed, and established by God Himself. Besides all this, in Judaism are the holy instructions of how to behave oneself both in the presence of God and among human beings. In summary, Judaism has at least these four things: the very God, the divine writings, the divine way for people to worship God, and the best instructions concerning human behavior. In addition to these, the angels are another one of their boasts. These are things which even at that time were very attractive.</p>
<p>The Jewish believers in the early days of the church believed in the Lord Jesus, but they could not loose themselves from these attracting elements. Who or what could compare with these five items? Nothing either western or oriental. The heathen have all the demons, but the Jews have all the angels. Unless you could offer them something better, how could you convince them? If they hold the silver and all you have is merely clay, could you persuade them to trade the silver for the clay? The best way to convince holders of silver is to show them gold, a quantity of gold. This was the concept within the writer of the book of Hebrews&mdash;what the Jewish believers had was but silver; what he had was gold.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BETTER CHRIST</h2>
<p>What is the gold? Christ is the gold. The Jews have God, but they do not have a God with a human nature. Now we have a God, not only with divinity, but also with humanity; we have something better. I do not say that what the Jews have is not good, but what we have is better and even the best. Their God is the hidden God, but our God is the expressed God. We have something more. The Jews have the Holy Writings, but their Holy Writings consist only of the Old Testament. What we have is a New Testament. We do not say theirs is wrong or not good, but it is too old, it is not up-to-date. We have a new and better covenant. The blood that sealed their covenant was the blood of a mere beast, but the blood that seals ours is the blood of the eternal Son of God. Can this blood be compared with the blood of a beast? This is the thought and concept of the writer. The way the Jews inherited of worshipping God was too outward; we have an inward way of worshipping God. Their way is old, but our way is new; their way is dead, but our way is living. We have a new and living way (10:20). The angels the Jews have are right and good, but the Jews always consider themselves lower than the angels. We who have the new covenant, however, are higher than the angels: the angels are just the servants; we are the heirs, the sons. We do not serve angels; we call them to serve us. Is not this much better? This is the concept of the writer.</p>
<p>The main thing is this: the writer had the concept that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the eternal One, is better than all things. He is the very God and He is also a real Man. He is the God-man. He is no more just God, but God and Man. He has the divine nature as well as the human. He is the very God now with two natures, divinity and humanity. He is far higher than the angels. He was made lower for a little while, but then He was crowned with glory and honor. How can the angels compare with Him? The Jewish people were always boasting in Moses: they said continually, &ldquo;We have Moses!&rdquo; But Jesus is more glorious than Moses. Moses is merely the building; Jesus is the builder who builds us together into a house of God. How can you compare the building with the builder? And Jesus is the real Joshua. Joshua was just the type; Jesus is the reality. He is the real Joshua to bring us into the good land, and He is also the real land with all its riches for our enjoyment. Praise the Lord! As Joshua was the companion to Caleb, so is the Lord the companion to us. He is the real Joshua, and we are all so many Calebs. He is our companion, and we are His partners; we are just one company with Him, going into the good land. As for Aaron, Christ is far superior. Aaron was simply a high priest according to the law, but He is the eternal Melchisedec, a high priest according to the power of an endless life.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS ACCOMPLISHMENT&mdash;A BETTER COVENANT</h2>
<p>The writer has a further concept. Jesus has not only so many items in His person&mdash;the God-Man, the One who is higher than the angels, the One more glorious than Moses, the real Joshua, the land, our companion, the Priest higher than Aaron and superior to Aaron; He also is far superior and better in what He has accomplished, in what He has given. He has accomplished eternal redemption by His blood, and by His blood He has made the eternal covenant, the better covenant, which has been made an eternal will and testament to us. Before His death it was a covenant, but after His death the covenant became a testament. Before He died He was the Maker, the Testator of the covenant, but after His death, in His resurrection, He became the Executor of this testament. In this covenant, which is now a testament, there are three items:</p>
<h2 class="head2">1) Sins Forgiven</h2>
<p>As long as you receive this testament, all your sins are forgiven. It does not mean that your sins will be forgiven, but that your sins have already been forgiven. What shall we do? What can we do but jump up and praise the Lord! But, I tell you, out of one hundred Christians hardly one who receives the testament will respond in such a way. Nearly all who receive it will say, &ldquo;O God, be merciful to me; forgive me, O forgive me all my sins!&rdquo; We all have been doing this, and we consider this a good prayer. But do you know what God says? &ldquo;Poor man, poor man, you already have a million dollars&mdash; why do you ask me to give you one dollar?&rdquo; Have you ever heard someone praising the Father with boldness: &ldquo;O Father, how I thank Thee, all my sins have been forgiven, even before I was born!&rdquo; Hallelujah! Praise the Lord, we have the testament; it is in our hands. Jesus is the Mediator, and it has been sealed by His blood. God will no more remember our sins (Heb. 8:12). The first item of this testament is the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<h2 class="head2">2) The Impartation of Life</h2>
<p>&ldquo;For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...and they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest&rdquo; (Heb. 8:10, 11). There is no need for any neighbor to teach you, because you have the law written within you. What is this? This is life imparted into you: you have something living as the law of life, not the law of letters. Sins are gone and life is here. You have to jump up again and say Hallelujah! This life is the endless life, full of life power, and we have it! This is the second item of the testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3) God Himself</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people&rdquo; (Heb. 8:10). God Himself is the main inheritance. We not only inherit forgiveness of sins and the impartation of life, but also all that God is, all that He can do, and all that He has planned. In this testament we have God! Hallelujah, Hallelujah! This is the better covenant, the New Testament; it is much better than the old. The Old Testament is really old; it must pass away, and it has already passed away. Now we have the New Testament, something so surpassingly superior. Jesus excels everything, not only in what He is in so many aspects, but also in what He has accomplished. The center of His accomplishments is this marvelous new and better covenant, the New Testament. He made it with His own blood. He was the Maker, the Testator, the Mediator, the Giver, and now in His resurrection as the living One, He is the Guarantor, guarantying this New Testament, and the Executor, day by day executing in us all that is included in it. It is too marvelous, too wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS QUALIFICATIONS</h2>
<p>O what a Jesus! O what qualifications! God is in Him&mdash; in Jesus you have the very God. Man is in Him&mdash;in Jesus you have the real man. He is a God-man, and He is also a man-God. This is much better than a PhD degree. Such a qualification as these two natures, the divine and the human, is much better than a hundred PhD degrees. He is the real Doctor of divinity, and He is the real Doctor in humanity. He is God and He is man: He is the very God and He is the real man. Now He has been sent to us as the Apostle more glorious than Moses; and He is the real Joshua, a real companion, to bring us into the real land which is Himself. We have all been called into the participation of such a One; we have all been made partakers of Him and partners with Him. What could be better than this? We were poor sinners: the only degree we had was that of Sin. But praise the Lord, we are joined to Him; we have been made partakers, companions and partners of Him. Whatever He is, whatever He has, <em>we share!</em> Hallelujah!</p>
<p>He is not only the Apostle to us here, but He is also the High Priest to God there. He is the Apostle here representing God, and He is the High Priest there representing us. He is the Apostle here caring for all our needs, and He is the High Priest there handling all our cases in the heavenly court. What a Christ! He is so divine with divinity, and He is so human with humanity. Here on the earth we have in Him divinity; there in the heavens we have in Him humanity. Here on the earth as the Apostle He is divine; there in the heavens as the High Priest He is human. As the High Priest He has the humanity to sympathize with us, and as the Apostle with divinity He can minister to us the heavenly bread and heavenly wine, as Melchisedec to Abraham, to meet our need. He sympathizes with us by His humanity, and He ministers all the riches of God to us by His divinity. He is so qualified: He is fully qualified both to sympathize and to minister.</p><h2 class="head1">&ldquo;WITHOUT THE CAMP&rdquo; AND &ldquo;WITHIN THE VEIL&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The burden and concept of the writer of the book of Hebrews is this: you Jewish believers must be brought back to this wonderful One, this One who is far superior to all you have in Judaism. What Judaism has is good, but what we have is better both in quality and in quantity. Why do you still hold on to the silver? Why don&rsquo;t you drop it and take the gold? But if you would do this you must realize firstly that Judaism, the best and even the genuine religion, is a camp which rejected Jesus. Jesus was crucified outside the city of Jerusalem&mdash;that means that He was rejected of Judaism. He was the true sin-offering, which according to the type must be burned without the camp. Jesus was really treated in this way&mdash;He was cast out of the city of Jerusalem, He was cast out of Judaism, He went out of the camp, bearing the cross. That was His reproach (Heb. 13:11-13). If you would enjoy this Jesus, how can you still remain in the camp? This was the thought of the writer. As long as you insist on preserving the elements of Judaism, you keep yourself within the camp and separate yourself from Jesus. Jesus today is not within the camp; Jesus today is not within Judaism or any other kind of religious organization. As the forerunner He has entered for us within the veil (Heb. 6:20; 8:1-2)&mdash;He is there, in the Holiest of all, not in the camp.</p>
<p>We must realize that today the Holiest of all has two ends: one end is in the heavens, and the other is within our spirit. Whenever we are in the spirit, we are in the heavens, and whenever we are in the heavens, we may be assured that we are in the spirit. If today the Holiest of all were only in the heavens, how could we have boldness to enter as we are exhorted in Hebrews 10:19? If it were only in the heavens, we must wait. But, praise the Lord, one end of the Holiest of all is on this earth, in our spirit. The heavens and our spirit are connected together. When we are in the spirit we are in the heavens; when we are in the spirit, we are in the Holiest of all. In one sense Christ is in the heavens, and in another sense, while He is in the heavens He is in our spirit. So let us leave the camp, let us leave Judaism, let us leave Christianity, let us leave every kind of religious organization and enter into the place where Jesus has entered, within the veil. We must abandon the camps and turn to the spirit.</p>
<p>If you are still remaining in any kind of Christian organization and exercising your mind to consider the matter of Christ and the church, you can never be clear&mdash;the vision of Jesus is not there. The vision of Jesus is on the isle of Patmos, outside of Judaism, outside of religious organization. We must go forth unto Him without the camp, bearing His reproach (Heb. 13:13). If you will only leave the camp to follow Him, you will be in the heavens and therefore in your spirit, the Holiest of all. Here you can gaze upon Him, you can stay with Him, you can partake of Him, and you can enjoy Him. Here you have the throne of grace, here you can find grace to meet your timely need, here you may enjoy the Spirit of grace, and here you may taste all the heavenly things, the good Word of God, and the powers of the age to come.</p>
<p>If you are such a person, do you think you could keep yourself silent in the meetings? If you are such a one, who or what could frustrate you from praising Him? Your heart will be bubbling with good matters; your tongue will be the pen of a ready writer. You will have so many praises, and Christ will be the sacrifice of your praise. Your praises will not be empty, but full of the content of Christ.</p>
<p>Not just the Jews, but every one of us needs an inward vision to see that Christ is everything better than everything, and He is all better than all. Secondly we must consider Him, we must partake of Him, we must enjoy Him, we must look to Him, and we must go forth unto Him. But we cannot do this if we remain in the camp. We must go out of the camp and enter within the veil. I like these two phrases, &ldquo;without the camp&rdquo; and &ldquo;within the veil.&rdquo; Are you really without the camp? If you are within the camp and without the veil, you will lose the presence and enjoyment of Christ. If you would enjoy Him and His presence, you must be without the camp and within the veil. Learn to know Him and learn to enjoy Him; then you will be filled with so many good matters and praises concerning Him. Your praise will silence all the enemies and crush all the little foxes.</p><h2 class="head1">MEETING NOT WITH ITCHING EARS,<br />
BUT WITH PRAISING SPIRITS</h2>
<p>We Christians must be such people. As such we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together. The less we have of Christ, the less we will desire to come to the meetings. The more we are filled with Christ, the more we long for the meetings and require the meetings to express something of Him. We need a meeting to say Hallelujah; we need a meeting to shout Amen; we need a meeting to release our spirit. We need to come together, not with itching ears to listen to Doctor so-and-so. Our itching ears must be cut off. The itching ears cause today&rsquo;s Christianity to pile teachers upon teachers. We need simply to exercise our spirit and open our mouths widely to say Hallelujah, Amen, Jesus is Lord! This is the best way for us to meet. If we meet in this way, our meetings will be full of praises.</p>
<p>The more we praise in the meetings, the more we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence, for while we are praising, He praises in our praising. I do not believe that in the solos of today&rsquo;s Christianity Jesus could sing the hymns. That kind of singing is a sorrow to the Lord and a real solo. Whenever we sing, Jesus should sing within our singing&mdash;how could that be a solo? The more we praise, the more we sense that we are filled with Jesus and saturated with His anointing. The more we sing in this way, the more we will say Hallelujah! We can never finish our praising, for the more we praise, the more we have with which to praise. This is the right way for us to come together.</p>
<p>I hope that before long the Lord will bring the greatest part of our meeting into praises. There may be just a short message for the inner ear, not for the itching ears. Most of the time will be for praising.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AFFORDING HIM GOOD COOPERATION</h2>
<p>In this matter we need to afford Him the best cooperation. I have already used the illustration of the three-legged race. If my partner is capable and clever, yet I am slow and dull, I cannot cooperate well. He will be bound by me. Have you realized that you have always bound Christ? He is your companion and you are His partner, but what kind of a partner are you? When you come to the meeting and He wants to sing within you, do you offer Him adequate coordination? Or do you shut your mouth and quench your spirit? If so, He is imprisoned by you. How then could He sing hymns of praise in the midst of the church? We may, however, open our mouth and sing in the spirit, and undoubtedly Jesus will sing within us. But our singing may yet be so poor and lacking in adequate content, for we are not yet accustomed to higher praises. We have learned to say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! O Lord! Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; This is good, but we must realize that these are simply the ABC&rsquo;s, the first grade. Could we praise with a psalm like Psalm 68? &ldquo;Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered&rdquo;; &ldquo;Thou hast ascended on high and led captive a train of vanquished foes&rdquo;; &ldquo;The kings of the armies, they flee, they flee! And the women that tarry at home divide the spoils.&rdquo; Could we praise like this? I hope that some day we will psalm the whole book of Hebrews.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, let us consider our praises. In one sense we are short of praises, and in another sense we are so poor in the utterance of our praises. Not only must we know Christ as everything better than everything, not only must we labor to enter into the good land and all the enjoyment of Christ, not only must we come together filled with His praises, but we must also practice composing our praises from the new vocabulary of our experiences of Christ. We need to practice this. Practice praising Christ out of your experience of Him; then you will become accustomed to it, and when you come to the meeting, you will praise with richer and higher phrases, utterance, and expression. How we need this! This is the best way to strengthen our meetings, uplift our meetings, and make our meetings so convincing and living. Will you practice?</p>
<p>We have been so long in the book of Hebrews. We need to praise the Lord according to such a book; there is so much content for our praises from the first chapter to the last. Through Him therefore, through the Christ of this book, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God. It is comparatively easy to open our mouth and release our spirit in the meeting, but it is more difficult to compose our praises with richer utterance from the experiences of the Christ of this book. We need to practice. If we do, our meetings will be entirely different; we will be delivered from the traditional way of meeting, and we will be like the hundred and forty-four thousand, singing a new song which no other can learn.</p>

<p>At this point we need another insertion to see how in our praises we need Christ as our incense. Christ must be the incense of our praise.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOLDEN BOWLS FULL OF INCENSE</h2>
<p>Two chapters in the book of Revelation speak of incense in our prayer. In Revelation chapter five, verse 8, we are told that the living creatures and elders in the heavens have every one of them harps. Harps, of course, are for praising. They also hold golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints. (Note that the word &ldquo;odours&rdquo; in the King James Version of this verse should be translated as &ldquo;incense.&rdquo;) We must be clear here that the bowls, not the incense, are the prayers of the saints. Our prayers are the containers, the golden bowls, to be filled with incense. Then in chapter eight, verse 3, we read: &ldquo;Another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should add it unto the prayers of all the saints...&rdquo; We need much incense to be added unto our prayers. The King James rendering of this verse is not so adequate: it says that the incense should be <em>offered</em> with the prayers. The word &ldquo;offer&rdquo; is not accurate; it should be &ldquo;add unto&rdquo; or &ldquo;give to.&rdquo; It does not mean that we offer the prayer and he offers the incense or we both offer together, but that the incense has been added unto or given to our prayers. Our prayers are the bowls, and the incense is the content. Many times we have merely the bowls with no content; we have only the prayers without the incense.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OINTMENT AND THE INCENSE</h2>
<p>What is the incense? The New Testament is a book of statements and definitions; to see the pictures we must go back to the Old Testament. It is indeed interesting that in Exodus chapter thirty we have firstly a picture of the ointment; then immediately following is another picture showing us the incense. I&rsquo;m sorry that in the King James Version of this passage the word for incense is translated as &ldquo;perfume.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit has no intention of saying anything concerning perfume. The concept of the Holy Spirit is that of incense, which typifies Christ. Christ is not a perfume or an odor, but an incense which we must burn to God. Have you ever noticed these two pictures, the one of the ointment and the other of the incense? The significance here is tremendous. It is that of two way traffic, the coming and the going: the ointment is coming to us, and the incense is going to God. Christ as the Spirit coming to us is the ointment; Christ ascending from us to God is the incense. The ointment is toward us; the incense is toward God. The ointment is for us to enjoy, while the incense is for God&rsquo;s enjoyment. We should not enjoy the incense; if we do, we will be cut off. Incense is absolutely and entirely for God. But there is an enjoyment for us&mdash;the ointment. With the ointment the priests and all the parts of the tabernacle were anointed. This is our portion. The incense is God&rsquo;s portion. The ointment is Christ for us; the incense is Christ for God. We should not only have one way traffic: we should not only have Christ coming to us without Christ going back to God. We must complete the circuit by burning the incense. We need the anointing ointment, and we need the burning of the incense as well. God anoints us with the ointment, and we burn the incense to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INGREDIENTS OF THE INCENSE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Their Number</h2>
<p>Now let us see the ingredients or components of this incense. The revelation given us concerning them in Exodus chapter thirty is exceedingly marvelous. In the incense are three kinds of spices&mdash;stacte, onycha, and galbanum&mdash;with pure frankincense (v. 34). In other words, according to the numbers and items of the ingredients, there are three in one&mdash;three kinds of spices with one kind of pure frankincense. According to the grammatical construction, we must realize that the first three form one group, while the fourth, the pure frankincense, forms another. This means three plus one, which equals four. Three is always the number of the triune God, and four, the number of creature, the human being, in a good sense. So the meaning here is that the triune God becomes a human being; divinity is brought into humanity. What is this and who is this? Of course, this is Jesus Christ: He is the very God becoming a man, divinity brought into humanity. All four ingredients are compounded and mingled into one incense. It is God mingled with man, God compounded with man, divinity mingled and compounded with humanity to produce the incense.</p><h2 class="head2">Their Essence</h2>
<p>Now we come to the essence of all these spices and the pure frankincense. It is really difficult to interpret these, but with the aid of many dictionaries and some writings of ancient times we may arrive at their meaning. It is indeed interesting. The first and the third, the stacte and the galbanum, are of the plant life; they are gums from certain kinds of trees. The second spice, however, is not derived from plant life, but from animal life. The onycha is a kind of shellfish. According to the best writings, it is a shellfish produced in the marshes of the Red Sea. Its origin is not good. Now look at the picture: the first and the third are of the vegetable life, and the second, the middle one, is of the animal life. Of course, this is entirely figurative. What is its meaning?</p>
<p>We must see firstly that there are two factors in the life of Christ. In one sense His life is a generating life: He is the grain of wheat that produces so many more grains of wheat. This is the vegetable life. Christ&rsquo;s life is just like the generating and reproducing vegetable life. Secondly, His life is also like the animal life, a life that can be slain and from which blood may be shed. He is the Lamb who was crucified on the cross for our redemption. These two kinds of lives have both been mentioned by the one writer, the Apostle John. In the first chapter of his Gospel he says, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world&rdquo; (v. 29). Then in chapter twelve of the same Gospel he says that Christ is the grain of wheat, which when it falls into the earth and dies produces many grains (v. 24). As the Lamb of God He has the animal life, and as the grain of wheat He has the plant life. The animal life is for redeeming and the vegetable life is for generating, for producing.</p>
<p>Before man fell, God destined him to eat herbs, only herbs. At that time no sin was involved, and man had no need of redemption. Just the herbs, the vegetable life, were sufficient for his diet. But now since the fall, man must eat something of the animal, involving the shedding of blood. Man has need of both the plant life and the animal life, the generating life and the redeeming life.</p>
<p>In John chapter six these two aspects are brought together. Jesus said that He is the bread of life. And when the Jewish people could not understand how He could be the bread of life, Jesus said that His flesh is eatable and His blood is drinkable. On one hand He said that He is the bread, and on the other hand He said that this bread is the meat. He is the meat-bread. He is the vegetable life plus the animal life. If man had never fallen, he would not need the Lord Jesus as the animal life, but he would still need Him as the vegetable life in order to generate that life within him. We have fallen, however, so God must redeem us and regenerate us.</p>
<p>In order to redeem us, there is the need of the second Person of the Godhead with the aspect of the animal life to be slain on our behalf. We know that Jesus was such a redeeming One. The second Person, the middle Person, accomplished this. So it is the second spice, not the first or the third, that has the animal life. It grows in the marshes of the Red Sea. What is the Red Sea? It is the corrupted world. Christ became a little &ldquo;animal&rdquo; in the marshes of this corrupted world for thirty-three and a half years. But with Him there is the fragrant shell&mdash;the onycha. This is the Christ who was crucified to redeem us.</p>
<p>The first spice is called in English stacte; in Hebrew it is myrrh. It is a kind of resinous gum which may be used as myrrh, even the purest myrrh. So we may say that stacte is another kind of myrrh, signifying death. Of course, the second item, onycha, which comes from a little slain animal, also signifies death. Then we have the third item, the galbanum. Galbanum is another type of gum derived from another tree. Nearly all the dictionaries and other writings tell us that its odor is exceedingly strong and disagreeable. But this unpleasant odor has three strange functions: 1) It strengthens the fragrance of the other odors. When this spice is added to the other spices, the fragrance of the other spices will be increased. 2) It causes the fragrance of the incense to remain, to endure. 3) Finally, the odor of this spice repels and expels insects and poisonous reptiles. In other words, it expels the serpent. The death of Christ in a sense is not so pleasant, but it really strengthens, it really keeps, and it really expels. Perhaps you have been as I have in places where there is an abundance of mosquitoes. It has been my custom every day to put repellent on my hands and feet to protect myself and expel the insects. Christ&rsquo;s death is a kind of repellent; it has repelling power to expel Satan.</p>
<p>From such a picture we may say that all three spices signify the death of Christ. In the essence of all the ingredients is the death of Christ. The triune God came into humanity to die in order that He might 1) produce, 2) redeem, and 3) expel. The triune God became a man to generate us as sons, to redeem us from the fall, and to expel all the evil.</p>
<p>Following these three spices, we come immediately to the frankincense. Frankincense signifies the resurrection of Christ. So we have here both the death and the resurrection. When we put all these concepts together we see that the incense is just Christ as God, incarnated to be a man, who died and was resurrected. In this incense we have both divinity and humanity, both the death and the resurrection of Christ. The triune God in man passed into death and came out in resurrection&mdash;this is the incense. Divinity mingled with humanity suffered death to impart His life to us, to redeem the fallen ones, and to expel all the poison. We have the numbers three and four signifying divinity and humanity, we have the three spices signifying the death for generating, redeeming, and expelling, and we have the frankincense to signify His resurrection. So we have here a picture of such a wonderful Person. The incense is nothing less than Christ Himself with all that through which He passed and with all He accomplished, His death and resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">Their Measure</h2>
<p>In the prescription for the ointment recorded in Exodus 30, definite quantities are designated for each ingredient. But in the prescription for the incense, no quantities whatever are mentioned. What is the meaning of this? This means that Christ is immeasurable, unlimited. With this incense there is no measurement, no weight. In the entire universe there are no means available to weigh Christ, there is no scale large enough to measure Him. Ephesians tells us that Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth (3:18). You may have studied modern science&mdash;can you tell how long is the length, how high is the height, or how broad is the breadth? The answer is this: the length is just Christ, the height is just Christ; the length is as long as Christ; the height is as high as Christ. This is the incense.</p>
<p>It says furthermore regarding the incense that all the ingredients must be in like proportion. Why? This simply means that Christ is balanced in everything. In all that He is, in all His being and in all that He does, He is so balanced. We are all unbalanced. Sometimes a brother is so humble, but he is also rather slow. Those who are humble always have an amount of slowness. We do not like the slowness; we like the speed. But with those who are quick, there is always an amount of pride. Neither are balanced. Take a good look at the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels: He is so balanced; every part is in right proportion. He is immeasurable, but balanced; He is unlimited, but so fine and equal. No human words can adequately explain Him, but we have such a picture from which we may learn.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seasoned, Ground, and Burnt</h2>
<p>All four ingredients of the incense when mingled together must be seasoned with salt. Salt is not one of the main elements, but something added to season the whole. What is the meaning of this? It is a type of Christ&rsquo;s nature, a nature which is incorruptible, a nature which remains forever the same. All that Christ is, all that Christ does, is a kind of incense before God; His fragrance is unchangeable and incorruptible. There is nothing in the universe like Him. With this incense there is no need of refrigeration&mdash;it is seasoned with salt. In salt there is corruption-killing power. In typology it signifies the keeping and killing power of the death of Christ. The death of Christ has such power.</p>
<p>If we would offer this incense to God, we must grind or beat it into small pieces, even to powder (v. 36). Finally, it must be burnt. In summary, the incense must be seasoned, ground, and burnt.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems that we have some experiences of Christ, but they do not remain long; they are here today and gone tomorrow. Why? Because they are not seasoned with salt. Three days ago brother so-and-so may have given a marvelous testimony, but tonight when he is speaking, there is a clear sense of oldness. His experience has not been seasoned with salt. Sometimes you may sense that the testimony given by a brother is good, but there is no beating, no grinding. His experience of Christ is good, but it has never been broken into pieces or ground into powder. What do I mean by this? Suppose a sister has a real experience of Christ and in the meeting relates it with a long speech. Suppose then that while she is speaking one of the brothers interrupts her and asks her to abbreviate her testimony. If so, she may really be offended. She may say, &ldquo;If they treat me like that, I will never come to the meeting again.&rdquo; She has had a good experience of Christ, but she has not been broken. How could our experiences of Christ become a sweet fragrance to God? They require the beating, the breaking, and eventually the burning. When our experiences pass through all of these processes, they become a sweet savor to God. We not only need to experience the essence of what Christ is and does, but our experiences of this Christ must be seasoned, beaten, ground, and burnt.</p>
<p>Sometimes when others give testimonies, we sense that they are good, but they are stretched and raw. They are incense, but they are not burnt. Anything after being burnt is reduced; it is not so great in form or in quantity, neither is it so fine in quality. It is reduced to ashes. Whatever we offer to God will be consumed, but it will be so fragrant to the Father. The experiences of Christ are indeed good and fragrant to us, but they need to be burnt that they may be fragrant to God.</p>
<p>If we would have a proper church life, this is the way. It is not just that we all have some experiences of Christ and bring them to the meetings. We may do that and we should do that, but we still need the seasoning, the breaking, and the burning; otherwise, the more experiences of Christ we have, the more of a problem we will be to the church. Only when we are seasoned, broken, and burnt, will the church be built up, and we will have the fragrance of burnt incense to God. We will have a little heap of ashes, not much in form or quantity, and not even so good in quality, but so sweet and fragrant to the Father. This kind of incense must be the content of our praises and our prayers. It is not just that we are so happy; so we come to the meeting to rejoice and to praise. We need firstly the real experiences of Christ with all the ingredients of the incense. We need secondly the seasoning, the breaking, and the burning of this incense to the Father. This is the incense we should offer to God in His tent of meeting. (The &ldquo;tabernacle of the congregation&rdquo; in verse 36 should be the &ldquo;tent of meeting.&rdquo;) This is the way for us to meet, and this is the way to be built up together by meeting one with another.</p>
<p>Experience is indispensable for the burning of the incense&mdash; the experiences of Christ, seasoned, beaten and burnt. These must be offered not in our home, but in the tent of meeting for the building up of the local church, God&rsquo;s dwelling place. May the Lord unveil these things to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BURNING THE INCENSE</h1>
<p>We have seen how all the ingredients of the incense include and signify both the Person and work of the Lord Jesus&mdash;His divinity mingled with humanity, and His all-inclusive death and resurrection. We have also seen that the incense is mainly of four ingredients, but that there is another fifth ingredient, salt, added in. So we may say that it is of four kinds of fragrant drugs, and we may also say that it is of five elements. We must realize that the number five signifies ability for responsibility. On our hand we have four fingers plus one thumb, which together take the responsibility for doing things. Thus, in the incense we have four kinds of fragrance plus one additional element, the salt. With the Person of the Lord Jesus there is everlasting ability to bear responsibility.</p>
<p>We have also noticed that no weight is mentioned regarding any of the ingredients. The Person and work of the Lord Jesus as a kind of incense is immeasurable, yet so balanced and equal in every direction. This is the incense we must put into all our prayers and praises and burn before God. The content of our praises must be Christ with all He has accomplished. For this we need daily practice&mdash;privately, publicly, individually, and corporately. We need practice to be delivered from praising in the old, traditional way and to learn to praise God with the incense. May I suggest that four or five brothers and sisters come together periodically just to learn how to praise with Christ as the incense. This means that our praises must have Christ as their content, that we must praise God with Christ, with all that He is and all He has accomplished.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO ALTARS</h2>
<p>In Psalm 84 we have a psalm full of praises for the dwelling place of God. In verse 1 we read, &ldquo;How lovely are Thy dwelling places, O Lord of hosts!&rdquo; Why are the dwelling places of God so lovely? In verse 3 we have the answer. It is due to the two altars: &ldquo;Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.&rdquo; The dwelling places are lovable because of the two altars. In the tabernacle, the type of God&rsquo;s house in the Old Testament, there were two altars, the outer altar and the inner altar. The outer altar was in the outer court; it was the altar for offering all kinds of sacrifices. The inner altar was in the Holy Place, just before the ark of the testimony with the separating veil between; it was the place for burning the incense. On one side of this altar was the table of showbread, while on the other side was the lampstand. The central position was occupied by this inner altar, the altar of incense.</p>
<p>By referring to a diagram of the tabernacle, you will see that the outer altar is positioned in the center of the outer court, in a direct line with the Holy Place. You will notice also that the inner altar is in the center of the Holy Place, in a direct line with the ark of testimony, the place where God meets with man. If you consider the diagram of the entire situation according to the arrangement of all these utensils, you will see the figure of a cross. From the outer altar you go in a direct line to the inner altar, and from the inner altar on to the ark of testimony&mdash;these three components of the tabernacle are in one direct line. On the two sides are the showbread table and the lampstand, both in one line, which forms with the other line a cross. The two altars are on the main line, firstly the offering altar and secondly the incense altar. The offering altar was wrought of brass, and the incense altar was overlaid with gold; so in the Bible they are sometimes called the brazen altar and the golden altar. These are the two altars in the dwelling place of God by which God&rsquo;s house was made lovely. The Psalmist could say that even the sparrows and the swallows find a resting place at these altars, not only for themselves, but for their young. This is figurative language. We are the sparrows and the swallows, small and helpless. But in the house of God, at the altars of God, we find our home. There is no other place for us to take refuge. Only at the offering altar and at the incense altar can we find our shelter and rest, not only for ourselves, but also for our young. The dwelling place of God is lovely just because of these two altars.</p>
<p>Between these altars there is a close and real relationship. We may say that they are one thing with two ends: at one end in the outer court is the offering altar, and at the other end in the Holy Place is the incense altar. We should never separate these two altars. The first is for the second, and the second is based upon the first.</p><h2 class="head2">United by the Blood</h2>
<p>The first thing which connects these two altars is the redeeming blood. The atoning, redeeming blood was shed as a sin offering at the outer altar to accomplish redemption. After the blood was shed, it was brought into the Holy Place and put upon the horns of the incense altar (Lev. 4:3-7). The horns signify power and authority. Without the application of the blood to the incense altar, there is no basis for the burning of the incense, and without the blood, the incense has no effectiveness. It is the redeeming blood that joins the two altars as one. Redemption could never be effected with only the outer altar. It requires the two altars at the two ends of the house of God&mdash;the offering altar, where it may be shed, and the incense altar before the ark of testimony, where it may be applied. The offering altar and the incense altar are united by the blood.</p>
<h2 class="head2">United by the Fire</h2>
<p>Another element which unites these two altars is the heavenly fire. Every kind of sacrifice upon the altar of offering is consumed not by any fire of earth, but by fire from heaven. In Leviticus 9:24 we read, &ldquo;And there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat...&rdquo; At the beginning the fire came down from heaven and consumed all the offering. This fire, we are told, should never be extinguished or allowed to cease. The burning power is from heaven. It is this very fire which burns the incense. Leviticus 16:12, 13 says, &ldquo;And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil: and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony...&rdquo; There is one blood and one fire that join these two altars together. It is the same blood and the same fire that make them one. Whatever is accomplished on the altar in the outer court must be brought in to the altar in the Holy Place. By this we see that these two altars are simply two ends of one thing. This is the reason, I believe, why both are called altars. They are of one name with two ends.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Their Significance</h2>
<p>The main significance of the offering altar is redemption, while the main significance of the incense altar is acceptance, or, in other words, fragrance to God through redemption. Without redemption, we could never be accepted by God, we could never be fragrant to God. We are redeemed at one end and accepted at the other. Christ is our redemption at the outer altar, and Christ is our acceptance at the inner altar.</p>
<p>All these matters are exceedingly deep and profound. We do not have much understanding or adequate utterance to define all these things. The best we can do is to see the picture. A picture is better than a thousand words. Thank the Lord, we do have a picture.</p>
<p>At the offering altar we have all been redeemed. Now we need to come to the altar of incense to be so acceptable and fragrant to God. The way we come is through the blood, and what we must do when we come is burn the incense. To burn the incense simply means to pray and to praise God with Christ and all He has accomplished as the content of our prayer and praise. This is the real acceptance and fragrance to God. We all must realize that whenever we come to praise God at the incense altar, we must certainly have contacted the offering altar. In other words, when we come to the matter of acceptance, we must surely have passed through redemption. Now at the incense altar, what we need is not to kneel or prostrate ourselves to worship in a natural or religious way, but to burn the incense. Outward worship means nothing to God&mdash;God does not desire or require that. What God desires is the burning of the incense, the praises full of Christ and all He has accomplished. The burning is our part; we must burn the incense.</p>
<p>There is no problem with the matter of redemption, we have all been redeemed&mdash;we are exceedingly clear about that. Today&rsquo;s problem is the matter of acceptance, the matter of the fragrant incense offered continually to God. You are redeemed, and you are satisfied. You can shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah, I am redeemed!&rdquo; You have the Hallelujahs, but God is waiting for some Hallelujahs. You are satisfied, but He has not yet been satisfied. He is waiting for the burning of the incense. At the offering altar, of course, there is also a kind of fragrant odor. The burning of the sacrifices affords a sweet savor to God. Undoubtedly God is satisfied with that; yet that is outward; that is something which is only in the outer court. What God requires is inner and deeper, not just in the outer court, but in the Holy Place near to the ark of testimony. God desires this kind of satisfaction, and He can only be fully satisfied by the burning of the incense. We have nothing to offer to God and we can do nothing, but we can burn incense. We can offer in our praises all that Christ is and all that Christ has done. I hope that you may even compose something in your praises about the incense&mdash;the fragrant drugs, the stacte, the onycha and the galbanum, the pure frankincense, and the seasoning salt. We do need some living praises, not according to the human and religious concept, but according to the living reality of Christ&rsquo;s Person and work. Try to do it. We all must try to do it. We all must praise the Lord in a new way.</p><h2 class="head1">STRANGE INCENSE</h2>
<p>When we burn the incense, however, we should not offer strange incense. Anything strange is an insult to God. What is strange incense? Anything which is not Christ is strange incense. You may be an exceedingly fine person&mdash;humble, patient and gentle, etc. If we are such, there is always within us a kind of subconscious concept that in ourselves we are fairly good. Sometimes, of course, our estimation is not so correct. You may think you are good, but really you are not so good. You may think you are humble, but really you are not so humble. If you come to God with anything of your supposed inherent goodness, you are burning strange incense. Do not bring anything other than Christ, no matter how good it may be. Anything but Christ is strange and is an insult to God.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate. The marriage life is really a problem. Suppose, however, that you are a brother who has never given your dear wife a difficult time. You have always been patient, humble, and kind toward her, and as a result, she has spread your praise abroad. If, when you come to the Lord, you bring just a little of this goodness of yours before Him, you are burning strange incense. Regardless of how good you are, that kind of goodness can never be offered to God. Instead of a fragrance, it will be a blasphemy.</p>
<p>What we can offer to God is nothing but Christ. We must say, &ldquo;O Father God, I have nothing to offer You, nothing which You can accept, but Christ, only Christ. Regardless of whether I am sinful or good, all I bring to Thee is Thy dear Son, Christ.&rdquo; No strange incense should ever be offered to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STRANGE FIRE</h2>
<p>But the problem today is not so much with strange incense, but with strange fire. The fire that consumes the incense must be from the heavens, from God. What is the significance of strange fire? Strange fire is natural enthusiasm. When you are natural in your fervency, you are offering strange fire before the Lord. Sometimes we need to be emotional. To be emotional is right, but to be naturally emotional is wrong. When you come to burn the incense, you must use the fire from the offering altar. The offering altar simply means the cross. We must pass through the cross that we may offer Christ as the incense to God. Now the problem is not with the incense, but with our burning. By what kind of fire do we burn the incense? With what kind of fervency do we offer the praise of Christ to God?</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO EXTREMES</h2>
<p>The enemy is exceedingly subtle. In so many matters he would keep us either at one extreme or push us to the other. In this matter of praising the Lord, many dear Christians have been retained by the enemy in the extreme of silence, and not only silence, but something much worse&mdash;death. They really believe, however, that they are right. When they come to a meeting which is full of praising and singing, of shouting and joyful noise, they are offended and extremely critical. They like to be kept in that extreme. They have their human concept. This is the subtlety of the enemy to keep them from the incense altar. If you would not open your mouth to pray and praise the Lord, you can never minister at the incense altar. Whether those who make noise are right or wrong is another matter, but to be dumb and silent is undoubtedly wrong. Those who shout and make a joyful noise may be fifty percent wrong, but it is certain that those who shut their mouths are one hundred percent wrong. No one should be a dumb worshipper. We must make some noise. Christians are praying ones, Christians are praising ones, and Christians are preaching ones. If you never open your mouth, how can you preach? You may say that you preach not by what you say, but by what you are. Then you are just a dumb preacher. If so, God must be wrong, for He created you with an organ for speaking. You may say that your mouth is for eating. But eating is just for yourself; preaching is for God, speaking is for others. We all must say something. I do not believe Christians should cease from speaking. They should speak all the day long, either to God, to human beings, to the angels, to the demons and Satan, or sometimes to the creation (Mark 16:15). Every one must know that Jesus is my Lord and your Lord.</p>
<p>When we come to the meetings, we must be speaking members. In the last one and a half centuries the Lord has recovered the universal priesthood. If we would minister in our priestly office, we must open our mouths to speak something, to pray, to praise, or to sing. I am more than sure that you are wrong if you would not open your mouth.</p>
<p>Now we come to the other extreme. If the devil could not hold us at one extreme, he will push us to the other. He will cause us to burn the incense with a strange fire, with something natural which has never been dealt with. So we need to be balanced. On one hand we need to be released, and on the other hand we need a certain amount of restraint. These two laws are always in operation to maintain anything in existence. Every one of us must be released, and after being released, every one of us must be restricted. The fire with which the incense is burned on the incense altar must be taken from the offering altar. Our fervency must originate in the spirit through the dealing of the cross.</p>
<p>To be a faithful servant to the Lord in the ministry of the Word is not easy. We would all like to please all men. I realize that among those reading this book there are two kinds of persons: some who would never open their mouth, and some who would never close their mouth. I must be faithful in speaking to both. Those who never open their mouth are one hundred percent wrong. I condemn this. I do not condemn you, but I condemn the dumbness. As a little servant of the Lord, I must speak the truth. Some of you, however, are so bold. You must take heed: is that kind of boldness natural or spiritual? Does that kind of boldness originate in your natural disposition, or in your spirit? You see, we need to be balanced; we need an equal proportion on each side. This is something of the Lord Jesus. I hope that we all may be equally balanced to open our mouths and at the same time to utter something with heavenly fire. We must burn the incense and burn it with fire from God. Those who would not open their mouths must obtain mercy and find grace to be delivered from their dumbness. We speak much about the Lord Jesus as our life and salvation, and in this very matter of dumbness we need Him as our life and our salvation. We need to be utterly delivered from this kind of silence. Then, on the other hand, once we are set free we need a certain amount of restriction, a certain amount of balance and checking within, that we may not burn the incense with anything natural, but with fire from God. We must offer our praises from the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EMOTIONS</h2>
<p>Let us be clear about the matter of our emotions. We need to be emotional. Some say that we are too emotional. But no one can be like the Apostle Paul if he is not emotional. Paul was very emotional: many times he spoke and wrote to the saints with tears. Once he said, &ldquo;What will ye? Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and in the spirit of meekness?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:21). Paul could be very emotional. At another time he said, &ldquo;For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye...?&rdquo; (1 Thes. 2:19). It is good to be emotional. If you can never be emotional, you can never be spiritual. But listen, not naturally emotional, but emotional in the spirit; not emotional with strange fire, but with heavenly fire. Our natural emotion must be consumed on the burnt offering altar. All the natural things must be consumed there. We need to offer praises, we need to be released, yet we still need to be dealt with; we need many dealings through the cross.</p>
<p>Do not think to be noisy is emotional. If we can never weep publicly while preaching the gospel, I do not think we can bring many people to the Lord. I have read the biography of a brother who had no eloquence whatever. He was able to speak very little, but whenever he stood to speak for the Lord Jesus, his tears flowed down. Just by that kind of weeping many persons were converted to Christ. All spiritual people are emotional. Learn to be emotional; then you will know how to be spiritual. Learn to laugh; learn to weep. Do not learn so much teaching, but learn the things that will help you turn to the spirit. If you exercise yourself overmuch in your mentality, you will lose the laughing spirit. Don&rsquo;t think you are so smart. Turn from your mentality to the spirit and praise the Lord. Learn to exercise your spirit and be happy and joyful. Rejoice in the presence of the Lord, and you will be much in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAISING BY THE BLOOD</h2>
<p>We must never forget that on the incense altar is the redeeming blood. Whenever we offer praise to God, we must realize that we need the blood. In ourselves we have no merit upon which to stand. The only merit, the only ground, is the redeeming blood of the Lamb. We have to say to the Lord Jesus continually, &ldquo;We offer our praises to God under the covering of Your precious blood.&rdquo; The redeeming blood must always be applied to the horns of the incense altar. Without the blood, all manner of praises, no matter how rich and high, can never be effective.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL REDEMPTION BY PRAISING</h2>
<p>In Numbers chapter sixteen we see that the atonement is accomplished at the offering altar. We also see in verse 46 a kind of burning of the incense which is in the power and effectiveness of the atonement. &ldquo;And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the Lord; the plague is begun.&rdquo; At that time the people of Israel sinned against God, and God judged them by sending among them a deadly plague. The remedy was fire from the offering altar with incense put therein&mdash;this could make an atonement for the people. What does this signify? It is a practical, instant experience of the redemption of Christ. If you offer praises to God under the covering of the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood and with heavenly fire in the spirit, it is not only an acceptance and fragrant odor to God, but also a kind of redemption. The problem between you and God will be solved, the death will be removed, and the plague will be gone. You may have no intention, in a sense, to receive such redemption, but as long as you burn the incense in this way, an amount of redemption is included. You will not only be accepted by God, you will not only satisfy God, but there will be an amount of redemption that will solve all the problems between you and God. All the plague of death will be removed; all the barriers between you and God will spontaneously be dissolved. You will be fully at peace with God, and God will grant you sweet acceptance.</p>
<p>Note finally that the center of all that which we have been speaking is the tent of meeting. Learn to praise God, learn to burn the incense in this way, not just in your homes, but in the meetings. Then our meetings will be enriched, strengthened, and uplifted.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE STEPS TO THE INCENSE ALTAR</h1>
<p>We have seen the two altars in the house of God, one for offering and the other for burning the incense, one for redemption and the other for acceptance. Both are united, as we have seen, by the redeeming blood and the consuming, heavenly fire. For burning the incense we need these two things, the blood to redeem and the fire to consume. We all have two problems&mdash;our sins and our self. We need the blood, therefore, to redeem us from our sins and the fire to consume our self. On one hand we need to be redeemed, and on the other hand we need to be consumed. The sinful things require the blood, and all the natural elements need the fire; otherwise, the burning of the incense could never be acceptable and fragrant to God. Praise the Lord for the two altars. Praise the Lord for the blood and the fire. All these things may be used to compose praises to God.</p>
<p>Now I would ask you to refer to the diagram of the tabernacle on page 190. There you see the outer court and within it the tabernacle, which is divided into two sections. The inner part of the tabernacle, the Holiest of all, is a square area; the outer section, the Holy Place, is twice the size of the Holiest of all. As we consider the entire picture, we see that there are six items of furniture&mdash;two in the outer court, three in the Holy Place, and one in the Holiest of all. Now let us read Exodus 30:26-28.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, and the table and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense, and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notice the order of the things which must be anointed. Firstly, Moses was to anoint the tabernacle, that is, the tent of meeting; then the ark of the testimony in the Holiest of all. Now note that the Lord does not go on to the altar of incense, but to the table of showbread, and then to the lampstand. Following these three items, the two altars are mentioned together, the altar of incense and the altar of burnt offering. Physically speaking, between these two altars are three articles&mdash;the showbread table, the lampstand, and the laver. But in the sequence of the Bible these two altars are joined together. If I were doing the writing, I would probably mention the ark first, then the incense altar, the table, the lampstand, the laver, and lastly the altar of burnt offering. But the record of Moses is not like that. The two altars must not be separated; they are one thing with two ends.</p>
<p>Both man and God are satisfied with these two altars: they are for our satisfaction and God&rsquo;s satisfaction. All problems are solved here. It is the first altar that fully satisfies us and solves all our problems. Whatever we need, whatever problem we have, the first altar meets and solves. At the first altar, of course, God also obtains satisfaction. But satisfaction to God is fully realized at the second. The second altar is for our acceptance, but not for our enjoyment; it is for God&rsquo;s. God&rsquo;s enjoyment is our acceptance. It is so meaningful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRALITY OF THE INCENSE ALTAR</h2>
<p>We must note that the entire arrangement of the tabernacle with all the items related to it are just for the burning of the incense. The offerings on the altar are for the burning of the incense; the washing of the laver is for the burning of the incense; the showbread, the feeding, is for the burning of the incense; and the lighting of the lamp is also for the burning of the incense. Look at the diagram of the tabernacle again: in the arrangement of all the vessels of the tabernacle the altar of incense is at the center. One end of the Holy Place is toward the ark, and the other end is toward the laver and the first altar. On both sides, as two wings facing north and south, are the table of showbread and the lampstand. In the center is the incense altar. By this we may realize that the altar of incense is the very center, the very place where God is satisfied and we are accepted by Him. It is not till we reach the incense altar that we are accepted by God. Without this place, there is no site in the entire universe where God may accept us with full satisfaction. The acceptance of man by God with sweet satisfaction is at the altar of incense.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STEPS</h2>
<p>In order to reach the altar of incense, God&rsquo;s people must firstly labor upon the good land. Without laboring on the land we have nothing to offer at the first altar; we cannot even take the first step. We must firstly labor on the land in order to reap the produce, to have the surplus to be brought to God and put upon the first altar as our offering.</p>
<p>Secondly, we need the priesthood. Today we are the laborers on the good land, and we are also the priesthood. The situation in this age is different from that of the ancient time. Long ago there were two groups of people, those who labored on the land and the priesthood. But today there is only one: those who labor on Christ are also the priesthood. First we need to be laborers to reap the produce, and then we must be the priesthood to offer the offerings, to handle Christ.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we need the practice of the offerings. We must know how to offer the trespass offering, the sin offering, the peace offering, the meal offering, and the burnt offering. Do not imagine that these are only things of the Old Testament. These are pictures of what we must experience today as the reality. We need the priesthood to handle Christ as the reality of all these offerings.</p>
<p>Fourthly, we need the washing in the laver, the washing of the cleansing Spirit, to rid us of all the dirt of the earthly touch. Fifthly, we need the showbread upon which to feed. We must experience Christ as the life and feed upon Him as the life supply. Then out of the life comes the light&mdash;&ldquo;The life was the light of men&rdquo; (John 1:4). So following the table we have the lamp&mdash;this is the sixth step. We need the life within and the Word without; these two factors give us the light.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, do you see the steps? The tabernacle is called the tent of meeting, and this is the way for us to meet, this is the way for the people of the Lord to come together to worship Him. These are not just practices of the ancient time; these are types of today&rsquo;s reality. In present day Christianity people speak of meeting merely as two or three coming together in the name of the Lord. But it is not so simple. Consider these steps. No wonder it is so difficult to have a proper meeting in today&rsquo;s Christianity.</p>
<p>What I am doing is placing a picture before you. By looking at the picture you realize that to pass through all these steps we do need the laboring on Christ as the good land day by day. You realize also that among us we need a priesthood who know how to handle the offerings. And you realize that whenever we would come to contact the Lord, we need the offering altar and the instant, present washing of the Holy Spirit at the laver to free us from all the dirt of the earthly touch. Then you see how following that we need to feed on Christ, the showbread, in the presence of the Lord, and then obtain the light of the lampstand, which represents the Word. I tell you, then we are in the light and ready to burn the incense. By passing through the offering altar the problem of sin is solved, the matter of sin is settled. By passing through the laver we are cleansed, we are filthy no more. We may not be sinful, yet still defiled. But by passing through the cleansing laver, our problem of dirt and defilement is dealt with. Then by feeding on Christ, the problem of our hunger is met; we are filled inwardly and truly satisfied. We can then light the lamp, and the Word without will exactly correspond with the life within. Eventually, we are no more in darkness but in the light and in a position to burn the incense.</p>
<p>If you are still under the condemnation of sin, you cannot come to burn the incense. You must first go to the altar of burnt offering to deal with your sins. Though you have dealt with your sins, if you are still dirty and uncleansed, you cannot burn the incense. You must pass through the washing of the laver. If you are hungry and unsatisfied, you still cannot burn the incense. God can never be satisfied with hungry people. If you are not satisfied, neither is God. If you are still hungry, God will tell you not to come to the incense altar, but to the showbread table to feed upon Christ; then you will be qualified to burn the incense. Of course, if you are still in darkness, it is rather difficult for you to burn the incense. You must first light the lamp; then you will be adequately prepared to burn the incense unto God. You see, all these are the steps through which we must pass.</p>
<p>Now do you see why in today&rsquo;s Christian meetings the situation is so poverty-stricken and desperate? There is no laboring on the good land, there is a shortage of the priesthood, there is no real dealing with sinful things, there is no cleansing from defilement, there is no feeding on Christ, and there is no lighting of the lamp. How then could people burn the incense? It is impossible! This must not be a kind of teaching to us, but an exposing. We all must be exposed that we may see where we are and what we are. We look to the Lord for His mercy. We all must look to the Lord that He will enable us by His grace to labor on Christ day by day that we may reap a surplus to be brought to Him. We must also look to Him that He will raise up among us a real priesthood, that He will cause every member to function in the meetings in a coordinated and living way. If not, all we have is the clergy-laity system. Furthermore, we need the real experiences of offering all kinds of sacrifices to God&mdash;offering Christ as the burnt offering, as the meal offering, as the peace offering, as the sin offering and as the trespass offering. We also need to continually experience the cleansing of the living One, the Holy Spirit. Then we can feed on Christ, and we can light the lamp. Thus we are qualified to offer Christ, the compound, all-inclusive Christ, composed of so many fragrant ingredients, to God as incense. We will be full of praises acceptable to the Lord. Our spirits will be so one with Him. He will meet with us, and we will meet with Him. He will speak to us, and we will commune with Him. This is the proper way for us to meet, and this is real worship to God.</p>
<p>These are the steps to the incense altar. There is the first step&mdash;do not be offended. There is the second step&mdash;do not be disappointed. There is the third step&mdash;do not stop. There is the fourth step&mdash;keep coming. There is the fifth step&mdash;we need to be trained. There is the sixth step&mdash;burn the incense. Now we know where we are and what we need to do. We do need this kind of practical experience. Check yourself. Do you really labor on Christ? Do you really participate in the priesthood by functioning in the meetings? Do you really experience the first altar, the laver, the table, and the lampstand? If so, you have come to the very place where you may be accepted by God and commune with Him. You will be sweetly accepted, and He will be fully satisfied.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR PRACTICE AND EXPOSURE</h2>
<p>Now we do not need more teaching. What we need is practice. We all must practice in our daily walk, on our job, in our school, at our homes. Practice! Practice burning the incense! Do not fear exposure&mdash;to be exposed is a kind of glory. The most glorious among the twelve disciples was Peter&mdash;he was so exposed; the Lord continually put him on the spot. He was so open, so bold, and so stupid. But that is exactly what the Lord needs. We all need to be like that; then we will learn something. We will learn to be right by being wrong. That is the only way. The more mistakes we make, the more we will be corrected. In any case, exposed or not, almost everyone knows where we are; so why hide? Let us put ourselves on the altar and allow the High Priest to divide us joint from marrow.</p>
<p>In the early years the church in Taipei grew very quickly due mainly to one reason&mdash;a willingness to be exposed; everybody was willing to be exposed. Everyone but yourself knows where you are; you are the only one who does not know your own state. You need to be exposed, not for others&rsquo; sake, but for your sake. It is so good to be exposed. Let us practice all the time, practice to burn the incense, not fearing to be exposed. Let us practice individually, in small groups, and in the meetings. Practice will make perfect. We should not merely go on according to the stage we have already attained. We must learn something ever new and fresh.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEAVING THE TRADITIONAL WAY</h2>
<p>As we have mentioned already, it is really difficult for any Christian to discover the proper way for Christians to meet&mdash; this matter is not specifically recorded in the New Testament. The way we have practiced in the past has been more or less traditional; we have either followed the traditions of Christianity or we have instituted traditions of our own. In the past thirty-five or forty years, we who have been in some responsibility among the Lord&rsquo;s children have had a deep conviction that the way we have carried on the meetings is questionable. In a sense, we do not know what is right, but we do know what is wrong. We do not know what we should have, but we do know what we should not have.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee is so bold to say in some of his writings that the so-called fundamental Christian services must be done away with. He said on occasion that such services were just &ldquo;the custom of the nations.&rdquo; When the people of Israel were brought into the land of Canaan, God clearly told them that they should not adopt any customs or habits of the nations surrounding them. But eventually they did this very thing: they assimilated many things, not from the law of Moses, not from the teaching of the prophets, but from the practices of the nations. Likewise, Brother Nee had the boldness to declare that the modern Christian services do not spring from the teaching of God, but from &ldquo;the custom of the nations.&rdquo; We are all well aware of the general arrangement of these meetings. There is usually an eleven o&rsquo;clock Sunday morning service, set at that hour so that everyone may have an opportunity to sleep late. Then the church-goers arrive for the time of &ldquo;worship&rdquo;; but what is called the &ldquo;worship service&rdquo; is almost a period of entertainment and relaxation. The burden of responsibility falls upon the hired pastors. The men of the congregation have been working in their offices, and the women have been laboring at home; therefore, this is the time, they say, for the pastor to do his job. The pastor preaches and the choir, led by the director of music, sings to the congregation. If any of the pew members are asked to function, with few exceptions they will say that this is not their job, but the pastor&rsquo;s. I am not being critical, but just presenting the situation.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord for His recovery. It is a recovery of being in the spirit and on the ground of the church, but it is something more. To be in the spirit and on the proper ground are vital, but these are only preparatory to burning the incense. In the center of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on this earth is the altar of incense. The goal of the entire service within the sphere of the tabernacle is the burning of the incense. We must have the burning of the incense in the church meetings. We have seen that it is the priesthood, the corporate body of the priests, that burns the incense. Who are the priests? The hired pastors, the director of music, the choir, and the soloists? I believe we are clear that we are all the priests.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING UP THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>To burn the incense we need the priesthood and we need the sphere of the priestly ministry, the proper tabernacle. The practical expression of the tabernacle today is undoubtedly the local church. There is no other way to interpret the typology. If we do not have the local church, we cannot have the tabernacle. As the people of God, we need such a tabernacle to worship and to serve God. Praise the Lord for His recovery of the local churches. Now in this country we do have some genuine local churches, we do have the reality of the tabernacle. Whether this tabernacle is up to standard or not is another matter&mdash;we leave that for the moment. In any case, we do have the local tabernacles. If it were only universal, we could not touch it; it must be local. Just the tabernacle alone, however, is useless: We must have the tabernacle with the priesthood, and since we are the priesthood, we all must learn to function.</p>
<p>Brothers, you must function. Sisters, you must function. If I could, I would be a troublemaker to every one of you. I would give you no rest until every one of you learns to function in the meetings. It is really difficult to be delivered from anything traditional. I know your habit of looking at the ceiling or looking around at the walls in the meetings. You may say that you are more for God than that&mdash;you do not look around or care for the adornment of others. You care for the Lord, but in a silent way, waiting for either the pastor, the responsible brothers, or the full-time workers to do their job. Am I right? This is the traditional way. So many take this for granted as normal and proper, but we are bold to say that it is one hundred percent wrong, one hundred percent according to tradition. This is Christianity. I challenge anyone to find a verse in the Bible saying that when we come together as Christians we must be silent. On the other hand, we have this word, &ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord,&rdquo; mentioned seven times in the Psalms. Who taught you to be so silent? Not the Lord. You must not bring your traditions into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>For years we have been seeking a way to help all the Lord&rsquo;s children function in the meetings. I do believe the Lord has begun to show us the way by the corporate pray-reading and praise-reading of His Word. I am not predicting, but I have a deep conviction that there is yet something new awaiting us. In any case, the principle is this: we all must learn to function. Do not still be controlled by the traditions. May the Lord be merciful to fully recover us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAISING FROM PSALM FORTY-FIVE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">WITH A BUBBLING HEART</h2>
<p>Here in Psalm 45 we have some principles for composing praises to the Lord. The first principle is that the heart is bubbling over with a good matter. When we look into the entire Psalm, we see that this good matter concerns the King and the Queen. The King, we know, is Christ, and the Queen is the church; hence, the good matter with which the heart of the Psalmist bubbles over is Christ and the church. We do need something concerning Christ and the church bubbling over within us. This word &ldquo;bubbling,&rdquo; which in the King James Version is translated &ldquo;inditing,&rdquo; means &ldquo;boiling up&rdquo; in the original language. Something is so burning within us that we boil or bubble over. We need to be burned with the good matter of Christ, the King, and we need to be burned with the beauty of the church, the Queen. We need to be so burned that our heart simply bubbles over. This is the first principle of composing praises to the Lord.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, if you come to the meetings and do not have anything bubbling over within you, you are certainly wrong. I say this politely. If I were not so polite, I would say (forgive me) that you are dead. You are not only wrong, but dead. Why are you so quiet in the meetings? Do not say that you are just &ldquo;being nice.&rdquo; If so, you are deadly nice. I hope that you will be nice in a living way. If we would praise the Lord, we need something bubbling over within us. Of course, this requires experiences.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMPOSING PRAISES</h2>
<p>The second principle concerning the praising of the Lord is found in the Psalmist&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;I speak what I have composed.&rdquo; The Psalmist has prepared something, he has composed something to speak. What he speaks is what he has already composed. So we all need to learn how to compose. Do not compose in the meeting&mdash;that is too late. You must bring to the meetings what you have already prepared and composed before coming. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;When ye come together, every one of you <em>hath</em> a Psalm, <em>hath</em> a teaching, <em>hath</em> a tongue, <em>hath</em> a revelation, <em>hath</em> an interpretation.&rdquo; This verse clearly indicates that at the time of meeting those who gather together already have something. It does not say that everyone <em>will</em> have something, but that everyone <em>has</em> something. When you come to the meeting, you should be able to say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, I come to the meeting with a praise already composed. I speak what I have composed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not mean that we must compose our praises with knowledge in our mentality, but with experiences in the spirit. For example, consider the knowledge we have just received in the past chapters concerning the incense. We should not compose praises simply according to this teaching. We need fresh composition drawn from our fresh experiences. Perhaps in the past few days you have experienced the sweet odor of the incense expelling the enemy. Whenever you utter something as incense to the Lord, the evil one is driven away. You have learned this experientially; therefore, you need to compose something out of this experience as a kind of new and living composition. When you come to the meeting you can offer this at the proper time as a bubbling over of what you have already composed. Our meetings then will all be new&mdash;not new in doctrine, teaching or knowledge, but new in the freshness of praises from our current experiences. We must forever gather new experiences and put them into praise, either by singing, testimony, or worship directed to the Lord Himself. We all need such preparation for the meetings.</p>
<p>This is a matter for professionals, and this is our profession. Our job is the priesthood; we are all priests of God. As priests we need to be professional, we need to be expert in burning the incense. From this there is no vacation: every day is a day for exercising our profession in composing praises to the Lord from our fresh experience.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR TONGUE</h2>
<p>If we have composed something beforehand, when we arrive in the meeting, our tongue will be the pen of a ready writer. This is the third principle. Firstly, we need the experience with which to bubble over; secondly, we need the composition before coming to the meeting; and thirdly, we need to exercise our tongue. We all must be the writers, so equipped and ready with our tongue. We need to be bubbling over with Christ and the church, we need to compose something before coming to the meeting, and we need to practice speaking what we have already composed when we come to the meeting. In the meeting we do some writing with our tongue. Our writing is speaking, firstly about Christ and then about the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREEFOLD PRAISE</h2>
<p>From verse 2 to verse 8 we have what the Psalmist has composed concerning the King, Christ. Firstly we must speak about Christ. Then from verse 9 through verse 15 we have the Psalmist&rsquo;s composition concerning the Queen with the virgins, the daughters, or the women&mdash;the church with the saints. Finally, in verses 16 and 17, we see what he has composed regarding the King&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned how seldom praises concerning Christ Himself are heard in the meetings of today&rsquo;s Christianity. There are frequent thanksgivings made for material blessings of every kind, whereas praises such as those found in Psalms 68 and 45 are practically nonexistent. Rarely can you hear someone praising, &ldquo;Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured upon Thy lips: therefore God hath blessed Thee forever.&rdquo; There is nothing about material blessing here. We must learn whenever we open our mouths to praise with Christ plus the church, the King and the Queen.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have the King, you must also have the Queen. The King introduces the Queen. Therefore, from verse 9 through 15 we have the second section of this Psalm, the praise to the King about the Queen. In other words, the Queen becomes the praise of the King. If we would praise the King, we cannot forget to utter something concerning the Queen, for the Queen is a part of the King. In the first section, the praise is <em>to</em> the King <em>about</em> the King (vv. 1-8); but in the second section, the praise is <em>to</em> the King, but <em>about</em> the Queen (vv. 9-15). Lastly we have the third section of the Psalm&mdash;the praise <em>to</em> the King <em>about</em> His children (vv. 16-17). The entire Psalm is a praise to the King, but the first part is the praise about the King, the second is the praise about the Queen, and the third is the praise about the King&rsquo;s children, the princes.</p>
<p>Psalm 45 is a Psalm about Christ and full of Christ, yet it is written from the various standpoints of human relationships. As a human being you must, of course, have yourself. As a human being you also need a wife. Then, as a human being so complete, perfect and full, you need your children. Christ is not a bachelor nor is He childless: He is the King with the Queen and all the children. If we would render Him complete praise, we must say something concerning Himself, we must speak about His Queen, and we must also utter something regarding His children. His glory is not only in Himself, but also in His Queen and all His children. These are the three sections of this marvelous and unique praise of Christ. It is directed to one person in three parts&mdash;the King, the Queen, and the royal children.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s glory is not only in Himself, but also in the church. To see Christ&rsquo;s glory in Himself, we must read the four Gospels. In these the divine and human glory of Christ blazes forth. But we know that following the four Gospels are many epistles. In all these we may see the beauty of Christ in the church with many saints. There we see the Queen with the virgins, kings&rsquo; daughters, and honorable women. When we come to the book of Revelation, we also see Christ&rsquo;s glory in His church and in His children, His princes. Actually, in that last consummate book of the Holy Scriptures, we see the threefold glory and beauty of the Lord: in Himself, in His bride, and in His sons, the overcomers. How much we have with which to compose our praises! Christ and the church with the saints! The King and the Queen with the princes! The husband and the wife with the children! Hallelujah!</p><h2 class="head1">TOUCHING THE KING</h2>
<p>Firstly we need to praise with what Christ is. In verse 2 we see this. &ldquo;Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured upon thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee forever.&rdquo; This is Christ&rsquo;s being, Christ&rsquo;s person. He is a man, a fair man, the man who is fairer than all men. As a man, He is full of grace, and God has blessed Him forever. Hence, in the person of Christ, there is the fairness, the grace, and the blessing. From verse 3 through verse 5 we have Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments&mdash;the fighting, the overcoming, the riding through. Today Christ is fighting, overcoming, spreading Himself and riding triumphantly. Here it says, &ldquo;Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride triumphantly...&rdquo; Do not think that the Lord is so silent. If we have spiritual eyes, we will see how the Lord is riding through the whole universe. He is spreading Himself by riding and overcoming&mdash;this is the way He takes to ride on. I am assured it will not be long before He will be here, He will return.</p>
<p>In verse 6 we have the kingdom. &ldquo;Thy throne, O God [He is God] is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.&rdquo; After riding through triumphantly, Christ comes to establish the kingdom. We need to praise Him along all these lines. In verse 7 we see the sweet relationship between Him and God. He loves righteousness and hates wickedness. Righteousness represents the things related to God, and wickedness the things related to the wicked one, Satan. This means that the Lord loves everything related to God and hates everything related to Satan. Therefore God delights in Him and anoints Him with the oil of gladness above His companions. This does not mean that the companions are not anointed, but that they are anointed not above Him, but under Him. We are the anointed ones under the anointed One; so we are His anointed companions. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Following this, in verse 8 we have the fragrance of all His doings. The garments in this verse signify the Lord&rsquo;s deeds. What He does is so filled with the fragrance of His death (the myrrh and aloes) and the fragrance of His resurrection (the cassia). Whatever the Lord does is always based upon the principle of His death and resurrection and therefore is filled with these fragrances.</p>
<p>At this point we read of ivory palaces where there are stringed instruments which make Him glad. What is the meaning of this? Ivory here signifies the unbroken life of resurrection. When Christ was on the cross, none of His bones were broken (John 19:36). Ivory is a kind of bone. Eve was formed out of a bone from Adam (Gen. 2:22), typifying the church which has come out of the unbroken, resurrection life of Christ. Hence, the ivory palaces are not the heavenly mansions, but the local churches, which issue from Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life. Out of the local churches the music, the singing and the praising rise unto Him. So, you see, what we need in the local churches is the raising up of praises. We need to praise Him according to all these verses.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TOUCHING THE QUEEN</h2>
<p>We have seen that the church is mentioned as the ivory palaces in verse 8. In other words, the church in this verse is pictured as a building. Then in verse 9, the church is also mentioned, but this time as the Queen. The palaces are the building, and the Queen is the wife. In the entire Bible God always uses these two figures to signify the church. In Genesis 2 there are firstly all the materials for the building and secondly a bride, Eve. Then when we come to the end of the Scriptures, we see the completed building; it is the bride, the wife of the Lamb. So in this Psalm we see the church on one hand as the dwelling place of the Lord and on the other hand as the wife of Christ. How many praises we can compose out of such experience! If we are praising Christ, we can never forget the church. Christ and the church are forever joined together.</p>
<p>Now let us read verse 9: &ldquo;Kings&rsquo; daughters were among thy honorable women...&rdquo; This is the praise to Christ, but about the saints, the kings&rsquo; daughters. Spiritually speaking, before the Lord we are all females; we are the kings&rsquo; daughters. We were poor sinners, but now we are royal, we are kingly, we belong to the King&rsquo;s family. Do not imagine that the kings&rsquo; daughters are one group and the honorable women another. No, the kings&rsquo; daughters are the honorable women. The kings&rsquo; daughters speak of our royalty; the honorable women speak of our honor and majesty. We should not be proud, but we must all realize that we are so kingly, so honorable. What praise this will inspire! When you walk on the street, do people sense something honorable about you? We should not forget our royal state and our honor. This is praise about us, but this is praise to Christ. If others say, &ldquo;Look at those poor Christians, what miserable beggars they are!&rdquo; that would be a shame to Christ. However, when people recognize or sense something in us of our royal and honorable nature, though they may not agree with us, that is a real glory to Christ. How much praise we too can render to Christ for all we see of Him in the kings&rsquo; daughters and honorable women.</p>
<p>Verse 9 goes on to say, &ldquo;Upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.&rdquo; The kings&rsquo; daughters are the saints, and the Queen is the church. Individually speaking, we are the saints, but corporately speaking, we are the church. We are all one Queen; the Queen is a corporate body. And the Queen is at His right hand. Brothers, if you have your dear wife standing at your side, and I speak commendably of her, you will feel quite happy. The praise is about your wife, but it goes to you. The praise here is about the Queen, but it goes to the King. When we say, &ldquo;Look, look at the resplendent glory of that golden Queen,&rdquo; the glory goes to Christ. Every time we speak well of the church, Christ in heaven is made glad. When we say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord for the church in Los Angeles,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Praise the Lord for the church in Houston,&rdquo; He is well pleased. Whenever we commend or speak well of the local churches, it is a kind of praise to Christ.</p>
<p>The praise about the King must undoubtedly come first, but the praise regarding the Queen should follow. Suppose you were the King: what part of the praise would make you happier? If I were the King, I would delight more in the praise about the Queen. Christ is deeply gratified when we speak well of the local churches. Our praises must not only be about Christ, but many times about the Queen, about the churches.</p>
<p>The Queen is seen in gold of Ophir. Gold in typology signifies the divine nature. The church&rsquo;s beauty is not in anything but the divine nature. She is royal and she is divine; she is in gold of Ophir, the best gold.</p>
<p>Then the Psalmist immediately turns to the Queen and says, &ldquo;Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father&rsquo;s house...&rdquo; Here we have instead of praises an instruction to the Queen which is exceedingly meaningful. But, I tell you, sometimes even the instructions given to the local churches are the same as praises in the ears of Christ. Why? Because the proper instructions given to the church make the church more really the church; therefore these too are praises. All the local churches must learn how to hear and how to forget: how to hear the Spirit&rsquo;s living, up-to-date speaking, and how to forget the past&mdash;the old relationships, the old way, and the old background. We must forget our people and our father&rsquo;s house&mdash;&ldquo;So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty.&rdquo; The more we forget the past, the more beautiful we become. Whenever I hear some people speak of their past, I have the sense of ugliness. If we would leave all the past and go on with the Lord in a new way, we would obtain beauty in the eyes of the King.</p>
<p>In verse 1 of this Psalm Christ is the King, in verse 2 He is a man, in verse 6 He is God, and in verse 11 He is the Lord. Because He is the Lord, He is worthy of our worship. &ldquo;He is thy Lord; and worship thou Him.&rdquo; The Bible allows us to worship only God; anything or anyone that is not God, we should not worship. But here we have the proper worship, because it is the worship of the Lord. He is the King, He is a man, He is God, and He is the Lord&mdash;He is everything! Worship Him!</p>
<p>Verse 12: &ldquo;And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favor.&rdquo; Here we see that if the local church is in a proper condition, the people of the earth will come to it. Not only the poor and the lowly will come, but the rich and the honorable, on the one hand with a gift, and on the other hand to entreat the church&rsquo;s favor. All these are praises about the church, but praises to Christ.</p>
<p>Now let us go on to verse 13. &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s daughter is all glorious within the inner part of the palaces: her clothing is of wrought gold.&rdquo; Here we have not the daughters, but the daughter. In verse 9 we read that the Queen was arrayed in gold, but here the clothing is of wrought gold. Gold, as we have seen, signifies the nature of God. Wrought gold, however, signifies Christ. Christ is not only gold, but wrought gold. He with His divine nature has undergone so many sufferings and has been dealt with in so many ways that the gold in Him has become wrought gold. Now this wrought gold, this Christ, is our clothing, our righteousness that we may stand in the presence of God. We are all justified with Christ; Christ becomes our righteousness before God. Hallelujah! What a source of praise!</p>
<p>In verse 14 we read, &ldquo;She [the Queen] shall be brought unto the king...&rdquo; You see, it does not say that she shall be brought unto God, but unto the King. Wrought gold is sufficient for us to be in the presence of God, but we need an added factor that we may stand in the presence of the King. &ldquo;She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of broidered work.&rdquo; This raiment of embroidered work is the pure and white linen as the righteousnesses of the saints mentioned in Revelation 19. What is this? The clothing of wrought gold, as we have seen, is Christ. The raiment of embroidered work here is also Christ. But the first is the objective Christ; the second is the subjective Christ. The objective Christ is our righteousness that we may stand in the presence of God; the subjective Christ is Christ Himself woven into our character, embroidered into our being, that we may stand before the King. The latter is not merely a garment that we put on, but one that is worked into us, stitch by stitch. Christ as the wrought gold is the righteousness put <em>upon</em> us&mdash;that is our salvation. But following that, the Holy Spirit day by day is working to embroider Christ <em>into</em> us stitch after stitch. Thus, we will have another raiment. We will have two robes: the first is for God the Father&rsquo;s satisfaction; the second is for Christ&rsquo;s satisfaction. It is by the second that we will be brought unto Christ. All these are definitions and descriptions of the Queen, but praises unto Christ.</p>
<p>I believe that nearly all of you have upon you the wrought gold as your clothing. But I also believe that there is a real shortage of the embroidery. All the brothers and sisters in the church life are indeed precious, and we praise the Lord for them. But in another sense everyone is a little needle. In the local churches we need many needles to do the embroidery work that Christ may be wrought into our being. Then we will have another garment that will be a real praise to Christ. In Revelation 19 we see that it is by this garment that the bride is made ready. Praise the Lord, we have the first robe, but we need the second robe that we may not only praise Christ, but <em>be</em> a praise to Christ.</p>
<p>Verses 14 and 15: &ldquo;The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo; The virgins also are the saints. They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing&mdash;they are all praises to Christ. They shall enter into the King&rsquo;s palace. All the saints shall be brought into the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head1">TOUCHING THE CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Then we come to the third section, the praise to the King about His children. Verse 16: &ldquo;Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.&rdquo; On one hand we are the daughters and we are the virgins, but on the other hand we are the princes, the children of Christ, who will rule the earth under Christ. In that day the earth in a practical way will be possessed to the uttermost by the King through all His princes. Then all the earth, all the saints, and the entire universe will say, &ldquo;O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verse 17: &ldquo;I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.&rdquo; How could Christ be on earth with all the people praising Him forever and ever? Through the princes, through His children, through us. To satisfy Him we are the virgins, the kings&rsquo; daughters. To rule for Him we are the princes.</p>
<p>I believe that this Psalm, Psalm 45, is the richest Psalm concerning Christ. No human mind could compose such a Psalm; it is far beyond human mentality. In such a short Psalm of only seventeen verses, how many points, how many aspects, how many items there are, all from which we may compose our praises to Christ. How much we have with which to bubble over! May the Lord bring us more deeply into all these things, and may we exercise our spirit to compose and use our tongue as a pen to write praises touching Christ, the church, and all the saints.</p>

<p class="hbody-hymn">(Tune: <em>From Greenland&rsquo;s Icy Mountains, Hymns</em> #915)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">COMING TO THE MEETINGS</h1>
<p>Now we come to the matter of how to come to the meetings&mdash;not how to carry on the meetings or how to behave ourselves in the meetings, but how to come to the meetings before we arrive. Our coming to the meeting should be a kind of preparation; it is our opportunity to be properly prepared for the meeting. Many of us frequently come to the meetings without preparation&mdash;we come in a wrong way.</p>
<p>We will look shortly into some verses in the Psalms which show how the Old Testament saints came to their meetings. But before we do, I must confess the sense of shame I have had in comparing our situation with theirs. They were the Old Testament saints, they were under the law; we are the New Testament saints, we are under grace. But when you look at these verses in the Psalms and consider their experiences in coming to the congregation of the Lord&rsquo;s people, you see how backward we are. Is not this a shame? The Old Testament saints were in the shadow; we are in the reality. Certainly our experience should surpass theirs in the matter of coming to the meetings, but in fact we have fallen far behind. The Lord, however, is recovering us and will recover us even in this matter.</p>
<p>In the Psalms we see that when the saints of ancient times came to the congregation of the Lord&rsquo;s people, they came with at least seven things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOVE FOR THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Firstly, they came with a love for the Lord&rsquo;s dwelling place. In Psalm 84:1-2 the Psalmist exclaims, &ldquo;How lovely are thy dwelling places, O Lord of hosts! My soul panteth, yea, even is homesick for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.&rdquo; A love for the Lord&rsquo;s dwelling place, practically speaking, is a love for the meetings. The Psalmist said that he was even homesick for the Lord&rsquo;s dwelling place. We need this kind of love for the meetings. We should be able to say, &ldquo;Without the meetings I am homesick.&rdquo; I could testify that it is rather difficult to keep me away from the meetings for one week. You could withhold my food for a week, and I would not feel so empty. But if you kept me from the meetings for one week, you would kill me. We need a love for the meetings. If we do not come to the meetings, we should feel homesick.</p>
<p>Let me check with you: where is your home on earth today? If you really love the meetings, you will say that the church meetings are your practical home, your practical family life. Consider the people of the world today. Do they have a home? Yes, in a sense almost everybody does. But why are so many not content to stay at home? Because they have a deep sense, though they may not realize it, that that is not their home. They are searching desperately for something more, but they have not found it; so they run to nightclubs, parties, movies, and many other things. But where is <em>our</em> home? Yes, the church meetings. When we are in the meetings of the church, we simply feel at home. Without the meetings we are homesick. Is that your experience? So many of us can testify to this.</p>
<p>Are the meetings you are attending really of the Lord? How can you determine whether or not they are? You can do so by the inner sense. If you come to a meeting without a sense deep within you that you are enjoying the meeting as your home, something is wrong either with you or with the meeting. You must be clear. If the problem is not with you, perhaps that is not the place where you should meet. Do not attempt to analyze these matters with your mind. Something deep within you, your spirit, has a taste, has a sense. Your spirit knows. When you enter the right meeting, the spirit within you, indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit, gives you the sense that you are home. You simply feel that this is the place. If you are asked to explain, you cannot. But you know from deep within that you are home.</p>
<p>We all must learn the lesson of loving the meetings. Unless circumstances definitely hinder, we must certainly come to the meetings. If we really love the meetings, we can frequently find a way around the circumstances or through the circumstances to be there. Sometimes we like to get away to the sea or the mountains. But we all can testify that the Lord does not grant us a great amount of comfort simply by contacting Him in nature. We are exceedingly more comforted by being in the meetings.</p>
<p>With everything, both tangible and intangible, there are two sides, and the Christian life is no exception. There are both the individual and corporate, private and public, aspects of our life in Christ. Some saints say that since the Lord is everywhere, it is not necessary to attend the meetings. Why should we drive all the way to the meetings, they say, when the Lord is with us at home. At home we can fellowship with the Lord and at the same time care for many other things; we can kill two birds with one stone. If we go to the meetings, we are limited. But, I tell you, nothing can take the place of the meetings. Nothing else can give us the blessing, the comfort, the life, the light, the edification, and the building up, etc., that we receive from the meetings. You may complain that the noise of the meeting bothers you, that you cannot bear a meeting so full of the sound of praise. All right, stay at home, keep yourself silent for two weeks, and see what will result. I guarantee that you will be cold and dead. I do realize that so many in the local churches, especially the young people, like to make a joyful noise to the Lord. You, however, prefer to be silent. I will not argue, but simply ask you to put my proposition to the test. The problem is that you are under the influence of your background, you still have your human concept, and you are too religious.</p>
<p>Let me interject here a further word on the matter of noise in the meetings. I have already pointed out how the Bible clearly tells us to make a joyful noise and even to shout for joy to the Lord. We are to come to the courts of God with a voice of joy. You may say that it is sufficient to have joy within and not necessary to express it also without. But this is tantamount to saying, &ldquo;As long as I have air, there is no need for me to breathe.&rdquo; In my early Christian life I used to say that I did not like this or that. But we must be careful: we may not like something, but the Lord likes it; we may not like the noise, but the Lord likes it. In several places friends have come to me saying that they cannot go along with the noise in the meetings. I have replied, &ldquo;If the Lord can go along, can you not also go along?&rdquo; Some have told how they have brought friends to the meetings who were offended by the noise. To this I have answered that while their friends could not bear it, so many other friends can. Ninety percent of the newcomers to the meetings accept the noise of joy and praise; only about ten percent turn away. Should we go along with the ninety percent or the ten percent? The brothers of the church in Los Angeles can testify that when their meetings were silent they had very little increase. When their meetings began to be filled with shouting and praising, however, the attendance in the meetings doubled; so many seeking ones were solidly added to the church life. Then who is right and who is wrong?</p>
<p>On the other hand we can point to some groups who are quite silent: thirty years ago they counted fifty in their number, but today they have fifteen&mdash;they have been reduced by being silent. Which way would you take? We must be like the business men: they do not care how they make money as long as they make money. Likewise, we should not care whether we are silent or noisy as long as the Body is increased. Our business is the increase of the Body of Christ. We certainly cannot say that noise is a matter of sin. As long as the church is not sinful, the best lesson to learn is to go along with the church. You may say that the church is wrong. The church could be wrong, and many times the church is wrong, because the church is composed of so many fallible human beings. But we must realize that to be wrong is one thing while to be sinful is another. Wherever we go, we must learn to submit ourselves to the local church.</p>
<p>Let us return now to our subject. We need to come prepared to the meeting. Firstly, we need to prepare ourselves with a loving heart. We need to love the meetings; without the meetings we should be homesick.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING SWEET COUNSEL</h2>
<p>The second matter is this&mdash;&ldquo;We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company&rdquo; (Psa. 55:14). Before we come to the meeting, it is good to have some fellowship. We can say to others who live nearby, &ldquo;Brother, are you going to the meeting? Good, let us go together.&rdquo; Perhaps you are surprised that there is such a verse in the Bible. Yes, it is there: &ldquo;We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.&rdquo; It is so good to hold sweet counsel with brothers and sisters on the way to the meeting, to fellowship or to praise together in anticipation of the coming feast. This is the second way to prepare ourselves and to come to the meeting. In so doing, our hearts are turned to the Lord and our spirits are refreshed and released. The Psalmist also says, &ldquo;I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord&rdquo; (Psa. 122:1). When he heard others saying, &ldquo;Let us go to the meeting,&rdquo; he rejoiced&mdash;this is the sweet counsel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMING IN COMPANY</h2>
<p>Thirdly, we should not go to the house of God individually, but in company if possible; not just one by one, but group by group. The Psalmist said, &ldquo;For I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God&rdquo; (Psa. 42:4). And again, &ldquo;Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord&rdquo; (Psa. 122:3-4). We need to practice this. Even in coming to the meetings we need some kind of coordination; we need to come together in company. Just consider how the ancient saints conducted themselves in coming together. I do not know why they were so much better than we are today. They went in company, they attended the congregation in multitude. How pitiful and poor when I go my way and you go yours. Why don&rsquo;t we go to the meetings together? I tell you, it really helps. This is a real testimony to the enemy and our neighbors in the world who are watching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WITH A VOICE OF JOY</h2>
<p>Fourthly, we need to come to the meetings with a voice of joy. &ldquo;I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday&rdquo; (Psa. 42:4). We need not wait till we enter the meeting hall before we shout our Hallelujahs and sing our praises to the Lord. While we are walking, while we are driving, while we are still on the way, we should begin. This is the way we should come to the meetings&mdash;with a voice of joy. It is rather difficult, however, for you to do this by yourself. If you come individually to the meetings, you may easily be quenched and defeated. You need a company, you need a multitude. Perhaps four or five of you can come together, shouting, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Amen! Jesus is Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">WITH THANKSGIVING AND PRAISE</h2>
<p>Fifthly, not only come with rejoicing, but also come with thanksgiving and praise. &ldquo;Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name&rdquo; (Psa. 100:4). Before arriving at the meeting, while we are still on the way, how good it is to begin to offer our thanksgivings and praises to Christ. Thank and praise Him for the precious blood which cleanses you from all your sins and shortcomings. Thank and praise Him for all He has been to you today. Thank and praise Him for all that He will do in the coming meeting. By so doing, you will be well prepared. This should not be abnormal, but our normal experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GLORIFYING GOD</h2>
<p>Sixthly, we have to give glory to the Lord, we have to glorify Him on the way. &ldquo;Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name...and come into his courts&rdquo; (Psa. 96:8). We have to let others know that we are on our way to the meeting. This is a real glory to the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WITH SOME OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>Seventh and last, we must come with some offerings, either burnt offerings or other offerings. Psalm 96:8 says, &ldquo;Bring an offering, and come into his courts.&rdquo; We all need to come to the meetings with something of Christ as the offerings that we may offer to God. None of us should come empty-handed.</p>
<p>By these seven ways we may prepare ourselves for the meetings. We need the love of the meetings, we need the sweet counsel or fellowship, we need to come in company with a multitude, we need to come with a voice of joy, we need to come with thanksgiving and praise, we need to come giving glory unto God, and finally we need to come with our spiritual hands full of offerings to be offered to God. I beg you to put all these things into practice.</p>
<p>If you get into the Word of God and compare what is there with what exists in today&rsquo;s Christianity, you will be amazed. It is absolutely different. The proper Christian meetings do not require the forms, the gifts, and the teachings as much as a daily life and walk in the spirit, a life of taking Christ as everything by the exercise of our spirit. The proper Christian meetings require this kind of preparation, plus the seven items we have just mentioned. As far as the Word of God is concerned, this is simply the normal way for Christian meetings, but as far as Christianity is concerned, this is certainly novel and revolutionary. We must be those who keep the Word of God. Brothers and sisters, if we come to the meetings prepared in such a way, we will be in a sense &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; people. We will be those who continually make noise by singing, praising, and testifying. If we come to the meetings with such preparation, how could we keep ourselves silent? Our spirits will be strong, uplifted, released, and releasing others all the time. Are you dumb and silent, flat and out-of-it, when you come to the meeting? If so, it is because you have not had this kind of preparation. If everyone is like that, of course, the meeting will really be dull and dead. In that case, you need some actors. The speakers become actors, speaking something for your entertainment. What a poor meeting, and what a shame to the Lord!</p>
<p>Let us come to the meeting prepared to demonstrate our spirits so boldly that Satan will be put into the corner, the Lord will be exalted, God will be glorified, all the saints will be edified, and the newcomers will be attracted, caught, and built up in the Body. Let us look to the Lord, pray much, and even claim this matter for the recovery of the church. I do believe the day will come when there will not be much speaking in our meetings as far as messages are concerned&mdash;most of the time will be for the demonstration of the spirit. Everybody, at least to some extent, will demonstrate his spirit in praising, testifying, and sharing.</p>
<p>Let us take these seven points, pray-read all these verses, and see what the Lord will do. Remember well that all these verses speak of how the saints in the ancient time came together. Today we should have more than this; today we should outshine them. Will you seek by the Lord&rsquo;s grace to come to the meetings in such a way? If so, the meetings will be greatly uplifted and improved.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF PRAISE</h1>
<p>The Apostle Paul says in 1 Timothy 4:7, &ldquo;Exercise thyself rather unto godliness.&rdquo; By reading this verse in the context of the entire two Epistles to Timothy, we see that the matter of exercising ourselves unto godliness refers to the real exercise of our human spirit. We must exercise our spirit to contact God and in so many things related to God. Meeting by praising is undoubtedly one of the major items of godliness. Therefore, coming together to praise the Lord is a matter of exercise. We need more and more practice&mdash;not just to listen, to know, or to understand, but to exercise what we have received. We need practice to build up a habit of opening our mouths; we need practice to learn how to utter praises and how to compose praises from our experiences of Christ. In other words, we must learn how to conduct our meetings, not by a leader, but by everyone. You are not used to it, I know. You feel awkward in the spirit, in the understanding, and in the utterance. So you need practice. Those who have little practice or skill in driving an automobile feel extremely awkward at times. What a frustrating experience it can be to park a car! But for those who are skillful it is done quite smoothly and effortlessly. The only need is for practice. In this final chapter I want to fellowship with you regarding the actual practice and technique of praising in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</h2>
<p>We must be very clear firstly that the principle which must govern us in all our meetings is the principle of incarnation, the mingling of God and man. Today, in the dispensation of grace, God would never do anything by Himself; He requires human cooperation. On the other hand we can never do anything by ourselves; we require God&rsquo;s cooperation. It is not that God Himself does something without us nor that we ourselves do anything without Him&mdash;it is that we cooperate with God. God is waiting to do something; if we would only render Him proper coordination, He would certainly act. It is not we that are waiting for Him, but He that is waiting for us. He desires to move in the meetings, but we do not render Him adequate cooperation. This principle has been greatly neglected by Christianity. Many Christians, indeed, are not even aware of it. It is wrong to say, as many do, that we must wait for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit before speaking in the meetings. The Holy Spirit has been waiting for years&mdash;the problem is not with Him, but with us. This is why we need training and much practice. We need skill to render proper and adequate cooperation to God. We need the experiences, we need the skill of utterance, and we need the habit of opening our mouths.</p>
<p>Our problem is this: firstly, most of us have come out of old Christianity, and it is really difficult to rid ourselves of the influence of our background. Secondly, we are still surrounded by today&rsquo;s Christianity, by the old way; so unconsciously we have the concept fixed and established within us that we need not bear any responsibility in the meetings. This is a major problem. So many of us have little or no concept and consciousness of responsibility. This is our background and environment, and we are still under this influence. To have the proper meetings we must all learn to deal drastically with this subconscious influence and take up our responsibility.</p>
<p>Suppose we could go to Mongolia, where the influence of Christianity is practically nonexistent, preach the gospel to the people and bring some to the Lord. We would tell them nothing about Christianity, but just about Christ and salvation. I do believe that they would spontaneously come together in an exceedingly simple and living way. Every one would function livingly and spontaneously, praying, praising, or giving testimony in whatever way we may turn them. They would be so active, sensitive, and responsible. But in countries where Christianity has prevailed for centuries the situation is different. Brothers and sisters, if we are honest with the Lord, if we do mean business with the Lord and are faithful to His recovery, we will abandon this kind of influence and consciousness. We have to realize that when we come to the meetings we must do something. We must have responsibility-consciousness.</p>
<p>But to bear responsibility in the meeting does not mean merely to speak or give a message. Absolutely not. To function in the meeting, as we have seen, means principally to demonstrate our spirit. Today the Lord as the life-giving Spirit indwells our spirit. When we demonstrate our spirit the Lord will be exhibited&mdash;this is a glory to the Lord and a real shame to the enemy.</p>
<p>Suppose that we have four hundred people meeting together in a merely formal way: they all sing a hymn, one offers a prayer, another continues by reading a passage of the Bible, and then another rises to give a sermon. Of course, that is better than nothing. But could that put the enemy to shame? Suppose, however, that four hundred are meeting together, everyone demonstrating his spirit. What a glory that would be to the Lord and what a shame to the enemy! This is a worship and a warfare in which everyone in the entire congregation participates.</p>
<p>We have the deep conviction that the Lord has turned the age from the age of religion, forms, doctrines and teachings, to the age of the Spirit. Therefore, whenever we come together, we must come with the release and demonstration of the spirit. The key to meetings in such an age is the release and demonstration of our spirit. If we simply release our spirit, the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit will simultaneously be released. This is the principle of incarnation. Hence, when we come together every one of us must learn to release his spirit. Of course, if we have sinned, our conscience will condemn us and our spirit will be bound. But, praise the Lord, we may apply the precious blood to our failures and be at peace in our conscience; then we will have full confidence and liberty to release our spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord is going to revolutionize Christian meetings. He will work this out&mdash;by what way, we do not know. The principle, however, we do know: it will be by the release and demonstration of the human spirit. The best way of demonstrating the spirit we also know&mdash;by praising the Lord, not in the old way with long prayers, but in a new way with short and living sentences. This requires firstly a daily walk in the Lord with daily experiences of Christ, and secondly, that we open our mouths to praise the Lord, not only in the meetings, but also in our homes, schools, and places of employment. If we have daily experiences of Christ and the exercise of opening our mouths to praise Him, we will have the capital with which to conduct the meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">BEGINNING THE MEETING</h2>
<p>Let us suppose now that we are having a meeting. We have learned already that we need not wait for the stated hour to begin&mdash;as soon as some brothers and sisters are together we may start to praise. In fact, we may even begin the meeting on the street while we are coming in. It may be started at any time and by any way&mdash;it must be something of the Spirit without forms and regulations. We may begin with a hymn, with a testimony, by calling on the Lord, or by praising the Lord. No one is designated to lead; we are all participants. We all must get into the flow, open our mouths, and go right ahead. Do not try to analyze or consider; do not exercise the mind, but turn to the spirit and say something. Try not to use old terms in the old way. Forget about old words, old phraseology, old utterances. Simply open yourself to the Lord and utter something from deeply within your spirit&mdash;short, quick, real, and fresh. Eventually you will be led to some line, some verse, or some portion. Then just go on in that flow. Once a certain point has been begun, all should simply follow just as do the members of a basketball team. Once a certain play is initiated, the rest need only follow through. Of course, this requires much practice. Even if the meeting has been started in a poor way, you still must go along and seek to uplift and enrich it. This is not a game for everyone to play his own ball. We are all the heavenly team, coordinating together to score for the Lord. There is just one ball for the whole team; so we must play in a coordinated way. I may pass the ball to you; then you will pass it to another; then he to yet another. We do need practice. We all need to follow one another in a good continuation and coordination. Of course, this requires considerable sensitivity and life in the spirit, but by continual practice we will all improve.</p>
<p>Let me mention now several important points to remember in order to achieve and preserve a good coordination in praising.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SENSING THE FLOW</h2>
<p>Firstly, we should never behave in the meetings in an independent and individualistic way. Seek to be sensitive in your spirit and sense the flow of the meeting. Once anything is begun in the meeting, simply follow and coordinate with others. Sometimes you may come to a meeting and begin to speak; but after just two sentences you will sense that you are out of the flow. You must stop immediately and seek to bring yourself into the flow. Forget about all your thoughts and intentions. The meetings of the church are not a place for an exhibition of your knowledge, but where we all may exhibit Christ in the flow of the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Please note that in order to care properly for the flow of the meeting it is not good to speak much in detail or to occupy too much time. It is better to shorten everything. There is no need when sharing to give the details of days, places and names&mdash;the attendants have neither the mind nor the spirit for so much superfluous information. Just give the main point. Tell the people in concise and living sentences how you have enjoyed the Lord. By so doing, the flow of the meeting will be uplifted; otherwise, it will be choked and the spirits of the saints cooled. Sometimes to sense the flow we need to be balanced: we should not care for our own subjective feeling so much as for the flow in the whole meeting.</p>
<p>Suppose now that there is a break in the flow&mdash;the subject is suddenly changed by one who is not so well experienced in the spirit. Then you must recover the flow; you must bring it back to its course. Of course, when it has been brought back, everyone must realize that now we are back. We should not go on without coming back; otherwise, we will lose the good continuation. It is sometimes good and right for the flow to take a turn, but we need a proper progression; we cannot jump from this to that without knowing where we are going.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING MOUTH AND EARS</h2>
<p>Secondly, for a good coordination we must care well for others, using not only our mouth but also our ears. If you begin to speak and you hear others speaking, immediately stop your voice and let the others finish their praise. This is quite important. After they have finished, you need then to continue in a suitable way. Perhaps what you had begun to say would not be fitting now. You need to be sensitive to the feeling both of the church and of the Spirit. This is not a small matter. Another is this: we must not only listen for others&rsquo; voices, but also care for others&rsquo; ears. We are not speaking to ourselves, but to the Lord before others; so we all must learn to speak in such a way that others may hear. We should not just love our throats; we should also love others&rsquo; ears. Some brothers and sisters are bold in speaking and skillful with the materials, but their voice is not adequate. As a consequence the coordination is damaged, for others cannot properly hear and follow up.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>Now I must speak a word concerning our utterances while pray-reading or praise-reading the Word. I do believe it would be more impressive if we would on the one hand use the very words of the verses as our prayers or praises and on the other hand mingle the Word with our fresh experiences. It is good to quote the Word and pray the very Word, but it is also good to apply it to our experiences.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we are pray-reading Psalm 45. One brother may exclaim, &ldquo;O my heart is bubbling over!&rdquo; Then another may follow, &ldquo;We do have a bubbling heart.&rdquo; That is the time then for someone to continue by applying the Word to their current experience: &ldquo;Lord, today my heart was bubbling over with Your presence.&rdquo; You see, this is not just a kind of quotation, repetition, or interpretation of the words of the verses, but an application to experience. We must apply the words to our experiences; we must match the words with our experiences. In this kind of praising it is better to have more experiences composed into the verses. A good proportion may be to use one-third of the time for praying or praising from the wording of the verses, and two-thirds of the time for applying the verses to our experiences. We have the subject with the various points from the verses, but the content should be our experience.</p>
<p>Suppose then that you go on to the second point of Psalm 45, &ldquo;My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.&rdquo; Here you need to introduce many experiences into your praising. One may say, &ldquo;Lord, You know how much I have been using my tongue all day to write something of Your goodness and lovingkindness.&rdquo; A sister may say, &ldquo;Yes Lord, my tongue has really been writing Your praise today for Your presence in my suffering.&rdquo; We do need to put our experiences into our praises.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VARIETY</h2>
<p>In our meetings we also need some variety; we should not always stick to the old pattern&mdash;the way we did it last month, last week, or even last night. Sometimes after praising a little, I may stand up to give a short testimony. Immediately following, another may call for a chorus or simply take the lead in singing. This may lead to a further release of praise. There is no need to fall into any kind of rut&mdash;that is degraded Christianity. What we have within us is a living Spirit. Do not allow your mind to be fixed; learn to be so active, so alive, and so flexible in any situation. We all must learn to be new; in every meeting there must be something new. Sometimes there is no need to pray or sing a hymn. Just get up to give a testimony&mdash;perhaps many more will follow, or perhaps the meeting will be launched into another period of praise to the Lord in a new way. Simply learn to be so sensitive that whatever you do will not damage or kill the meeting. A person who walks in the spirit is always exceedingly sensitive. Our aim must always be to uplift, enrich, or intensify the spirit, whether by singing, testimony, praise, or any other means.</p>
<p>We all need to learn and practice many skills in order to render the best cooperation to the Lord. He is so living and moving, yet He needs our cooperation, our skillful cooperation. We must learn how to shout, how to speak, how to testify, and how to call for a hymn or a chorus to meet the need. We must learn many things in many ways; then we will be flexible to go on in the flow. We will have nothing predetermined, nothing set or fixed; we will be so new and coordinated in one spirit, following the flow all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SISTERS</h2>
<p>Let me say a word now in regard to the sisters. The sisters must be bold to participate. We brothers, on the other hand, are too bold; we must give opportunity to the sisters that they also may enter in. They are the weaker vessels (1 Pet. 3:7); we should be considerate of them. The sisters, however, must be strengthened and emboldened both in spirit and voice. For some of them it is not easy; so they must practice. When we are short of the sisters&rsquo; participation, the meeting will not be as strong. Hence, the sisters must take up their responsibility and fulfill their part. They must overcome their shyness. As a matter of fact, I have noticed when attending some sisters&rsquo; meetings that the sisters then are greatly released. So I would ask them to try to cooperate better with the brothers. This will greatly help and strengthen the meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">THOSE NATURALLY ACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK</h2>
<p>A word now to those who are so accustomed to open their mouths in a natural way in the meetings: I beg you to be somewhat restricted. I do not believe the Lord is so happy to listen to you, because you are so used to speaking. I am afraid that may be a kind of strange fire (Lev. 10:1). On the other hand, those who are so quiet and dumb must open their mouths. I do believe the opening of their mouths is a real joy to the Lord. The Lord will say, &ldquo;Look, a dumb child is opening his mouth!&rdquo; This is a wonder and a miracle. So we must be careful. You know where you stand. If you are accustomed to opening your mouth in a natural way, learn to be restricted. Give more opportunity to those who are usually quiet to enter in and participate in the praise. If you are not accustomed to opening your mouth, learn to open it. Of course, we all must take responsibility to go on without undue hesitation and waiting; yet we must still care for others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Now let us consider some examples of meetings and make a few remarks regarding them.</p>
<p>Suppose that we come together and are not quite clear what we should do. One may begin, &ldquo;Lord, we thank Thee for the meeting tonight.&rdquo; Then another may say, &ldquo;It is good to come together.&rdquo; This is not too bad, but we must go on from this to uplift the meeting. You may say, &ldquo;Lord, we meet together with Thee.&rdquo; Then someone else may continue, &ldquo;With Thee as the center.&rdquo; From this you will turn to something further till you hit some point. That point will probably coincide with the current flow in the meetings of the church. Suppose that the flow is the victory of the Lord. It may be good then to use Psalm 68. This will further uplift the meeting and release the praises.</p>
<p>Suppose now that you have begun your meeting with the subject of newness. Concerning this matter, you must realize, there is very little Scripture. With the doctrine of newness, you can finish in two sentences, and you may just find yourself repeating, &ldquo;newness, newness, newness.&rdquo; So here you need the experiences. Without experiences you will be tongue-tied, but with them, you will have many things to say. There is no need to restrict ourselves to the doctrine in such a subject. I believe many of us do have the experiences, but we have not learned how to apply them. It is better to give short testimonies telling how new Christ is according to your experiences. Two or three sentences is sufficient; you need not give a long testimony&mdash;this will kill the praising. Then others will follow to praise, taking your testimony as a base. Someone else may then share a further testimony regarding his experience of the Lord&rsquo;s newness. At a certain point we will need a proper hymn to match the praise. After the singing some will continue to praise according to the wording of the hymn. Later we may need a chorus as an insertion to uplift the meeting even further. There should not be any rules or forms. We all must learn to be so alive. We should certainly not be praising the Lord for His newness and yet our way of praising be old.</p>
<p>Now suppose that in our meeting we have taken up the matter of the greatness of God. This is a good point, but there is still not much doctrine here. Yet you may have many things to say. One may rise and say, &ldquo;Look at the universe; how great God is!&rdquo; Another may say, &ldquo;Look at the millions of saints in the earth; how great God is!&rdquo; Then another may say, &ldquo;Look at all the local churches. See how all the saints are being built up together in love. How great God is!&rdquo; Eventually someone may exclaim, &ldquo;Look at us. See how He is building us up here as the local church in this place. How great God is!&rdquo; This will release a volume of praise. When the meeting has reached the climax, we may then sing the hymn, &ldquo;How great Thou art!&rdquo; We will all be in the heavenlies.</p>
<p>Another meeting may begin with praising about the Lord&rsquo;s name. Here you have one of the richest and fullest of subjects. There are many doctrines regarding His name, and, of course, it is so easy to release some testimonies on this matter. But we need the skill. With such a subject, before we get into the various aspects and our experiences concerning it, we need to give some kind of definition, some kind of exposition of the name. Someone may then follow by saying that the name of Jesus is a mighty name. This is one aspect, but to mention the aspect of mightiness first is not so fitting. It is better first to speak of the sweetness of the name. The name of Jesus is so sweet&mdash;sweet to us in this way and sweet to us in that way. We could continue our praising of the name of the Lord for one hundred days and not be exhausted, but we need the skill. We may then turn from the sweetness to the mightiness. The sweet name is the mighty name. There are many doctrines and many hymns and choruses that we can use to enrich our praising in this matter. We need the practice till we acquire the skill.</p>
<p>In still another meeting we may praise the Lord for His house. This also is an excellent subject: it is exceedingly rich and easy to deal with&mdash;even easier than the name of the Lord. Yet we all need more skill. If we have entered into a subject like this, we need time first of all to define what the house is. Then we need to point out in our praises the goodness of the house. From there we may go on from one aspect to another, matching each one with our experiences. Of course, there are many songs and choruses we may use to enrich the praise.</p>
<p>Now I do believe that we all have the idea. We need more and more practice, however, that we may obtain a better coordination one with another and render the best cooperation to God. If we learn to meet together in this way with the proper skill, our meetings will be so sweet, so rich, so inspiring, and so edifying. They will be much more effective than the meetings merely with teachings and messages.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INSTANT ANOINTING</h2>
<p>Every time we come to the meetings, we must come fully open to the Lord, not knowing just how the meeting will be carried on. There is no need to decide that tonight we will praise the Lord for His name or His victory or some other topic. That does not work. There is no need to make up our mind in certain matters. In fact, we should not bring anything to the meeting according to our head knowledge. That will damage; that will bring death; that we must forsake. Forget about making up your mind in any way. Just keep yourself in the Lord&rsquo;s fellowship; just keep yourself open to the Lord. Perhaps at the moment you enter the meeting place you will instantly receive a certain sense deep within you. Just utter that; just follow that. You may never have dreamed of this when you were home; it is so new, so instant, so up-to-date. It may be a sense of the exceeding goodness of the Lord. Then you can immediately praise the Lord, &ldquo;O Lord, how good You are!&rdquo; Just praise the Lord according to the instant sense in your spirit. All the others will then coordinate. One has begun, and we will all cooperate to play the same ball. Then the meeting is started. The meetings in this day of the spirit should have no regulations, forms, or particular trends to follow. We all must be fully open to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WAY IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The new way of meeting is a way in the Spirit. It is not according to the teachings or doctrines of the Bible (of course, it is not contrary to the clear words of Scripture), but absolutely according to the Spirit. Do not say, &ldquo;We must act in such and such a way according to the Scriptures.&rdquo; In a sense I agree with you, but I tell you, that will kill you. The written code kills. It is rather difficult to find a verse in the Bible telling us to walk according to the Word, but there are several verses instructing us to walk according to the Spirit (<em>e.g.,</em> Rom. 8:4 and Gal. 5:16). We must be clear, I say again, that if we walk according to the Spirit, we will certainly not act in contradiction to the Word; everything will correspond to the Word. But the Spirit must be the leading, controlling factor. Do you see the difference? Merely taking the Word in letter and seeking to walk according to it will kill us. For seven years I was with a group that attempted this, and I know too well the resulting death. The Bible tells us that we must walk according to the Spirit, without anything in opposition to the Word. This is the new way. We all must learn, therefore, how to exercise our spirit, release our spirit, strengthen our spirit, and demonstrate our spirit. Then the Lord will be exhibited, the Father will be glorified, the saints will be edified, and the church will be built up in a practical way in the locality where we live. Practice this above all, and you will be ready for the meetings.</p>
<p>We must lay the foundation of the meetings in such a way. Once the foundation has been laid, it will be so easy for the newly saved ones and newcomers to follow. May the Lord be gracious to us that He may have a full recovery.</p></body></html>
