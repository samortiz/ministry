<p>The most important part of the meeting is after the gospel friends respond and the singing is concluded. This part is related to our gospel conversation. There are a few points that require our attention. First, the topic of our conversation should be focused on the message of the gospel meeting. Second, we should be sensitive to the feeling of the gospel friend. For example, if the gospel friend wants to speak about God, we should not bring up the matter of sin. I once observed a gospel friend who wanted to know about God, but the saints kept speaking about Bethlehem. This was inappropriate to that person&rsquo;s need. The topic of a gospel conversation should meet the need of the gospel friend, not our interest. If he says that there is no God, we should not argue with him but help him see the truth. Furthermore, we should not be silent if he blasphemes God.</p>
<p>For the most part, we should avoid arguing with the gospel friends. Arguments are useless and cannot solve any problem. We should not reply to issues that stir up debate. There is no solution to these issues. Instead, we should focus on positive things and engage our friends in positive issues. We should pay attention to this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STEPS IN A GOSPEL CONVERSATION</h2>
<p>There are several steps in a gospel conversation. We should lead people to know God and acknowledge that God exists. We should lead people to confess that Jesus Christ is God. Some people do not believe that God exists, and others believe that God exists but do not believe that Jesus Christ is God. We should also lead people to confess that they are sinners in more than a general way. We should help them feel that they have sinned and admit that they are sinners. We should also lead people to acknowledge the redemption of the cross by showing them how the Lord died on the cross and shed His blood to wash them of their sins. Furthermore, we should lead people to believe into the Lord, confess their sins, and receive the Lord Jesus as their Savior. When we follow these five steps, the gospel friend is ready to believe, and we can lead him to have a short prayer. However, we should not force him to pray. The prayer is for the gospel friend to confess his sins and receive the Lord. If he does not know how to pray, we can lead him to repeat after us. However, we should not force him to pray. We should never insist that he kneel down to pray. If the gospel friend wants to kneel down, we can kneel down with him, but if he has no such sense, he can pray while sitting. Whatever we do depends on the gospel friend&rsquo;s sense.</p>
<p>Finally, we should lead our gospel friend to know that he is saved. This assurance of salvation, or proof of salvation, is in the Word of God. We must help him with at least one verse in the Bible so that he knows that his sins are forgiven and that he has eternal life. Hence, in our gospel conversation, we need to lead people to believe in the existence of God, to believe that Jesus Christ is God, to see that man has sins, to acknowledge the redemption of the cross, and to believe and receive the Lord, which includes repentance and the confession of sins through prayer, and to have the assurance of salvation. We do not need to be legal and include all six points in every conversation. We need to be living in the application of these points.</p>
<p>When we speak with someone, we must first sense his feeling. For example, a gospel friend may have no problem with the existence of God and even know that Jesus is the true God. But he may not have much feeling in regard to his sins. We should help him touch his feeling concerning sins. It requires much skill to help a person touch his feeling concerning sins. We should not interrogate him and ask whether he thinks that he has no sins. Even a person who has committed a gross sin will deny it. When a person is put in a position of denying his sin out of a guilty conscience, there is no way to continue the conversation. Consequently, we need to speak wisely with others concerning sin. We can use our own experience of our attitude toward our parents as an example when we speak of sins. This will help our gospel friends touch their conscience. No matter how perfect a person is, if he considers how he has treated his parents, he will realize that he is not without blame. Even the best child in the world is short with regard to his parents. We should not condemn our gospel friends, but we should touch their conscience and leave them with no excuse. We should touch their feeling and not offend them or provoke them to anger. We can also use our thoughts as another illustration. We may say that sometimes we are covetous, and our thoughts are unclean. No matter how decent and upright a person is, he cannot claim that his thoughts are always clean. We should not begin a debate in an argumentative tone, but we should touch his feeling. We should also give him an example in our practical daily life in order to touch his feeling. Sometimes the Holy Spirit will work in him to touch his feeling. As a result, he will not only feel that he has sins but also confess his sins.</p>
<p>Suppose a person admits that there is God, that Jesus Christ is God, and that he has sins, but he does not sufficiently know the redemption of the Lord Jesus. We should begin to speak of the cross and lead him to know the cross. Perhaps he has no problems with the cross, and he also understands the gospel. He may agree with the gospel but not have believed in the Lord. He lacks the step of believing. He has not prostrated himself before God to confess his sins and receive God. At this time we may use an illustration and say that it is not enough to prepare a meal and admire it, we still need to eat it. In order to eat the Lord Jesus, we need to pray. We can then lead him in prayer and say to him that this is to believe in and receive the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>This person now has received the Lord Jesus and also has faith. However, he does not have the assurance of his salvation. He does not know for sure that he is saved. He has confessed his sins and received the Lord Jesus as his Savior, but he does not have the assurance that his sins are forgiven or that he is saved. Hence, we should lead him to read a few verses in the Bible to show him that when a person believes in the Lord Jesus, his sins are forgiven. Once a person believes, he is saved and has eternal life. To have eternal life means that we will never perish. We can use John 10:28, which says, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever.&rdquo; We should be prepared with verses like this so that when the time is right, we can open the Bible and read the verses. Usually it is sufficient to use only a few verses.</p>
<p>Here is another example. Suppose a gospel friend feels that his sins are not forgiven. We can read 1 John 1:9, which says, &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo; Then we can ask him whether he confessed his sins. If he says that he did, we can ask him what God says about that and then have him read the verse. We can ask him again in order to help him receive the Word of God. We can also explain that since God is faithful and righteous, as soon as we confess our sins, God will forgive and cleanse us. This word in the Bible is very clear. We should believe the clear word in the Bible. This can be compared to receiving a check. An amount of money is clearly written on the check. We should believe what is written on the check. We should not hold the check in our hand and say that we do not have money. To do this means that we do not believe what is written on the check.</p>
<p>We should all believe the words of God in the Bible, and we must learn to lead people to receive the word in the Bible. If we exercise to do so, we will receive light and will also lead others in a positive way. We should practice conversing in this way and not wait until the end of a gospel meeting. When we visit others, we can also apply these points. We must learn not to debate with others. We should also avoid answering too many questions. We should also learn to sense where people are in the gospel. Then we can lead them step by step and level by level.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING VISITATION</h2>
<p>At the end of the gospel meeting, we should take down the information of our gospel friends. The saints should visit the gospel friends in the following days. When we visit a gospel friend, it is best to ask another brother or sister to go with us. When we are with our gospel friend, we should let the brother or sister who accompanies us speak, and we can assist. We should also keep a record of our visitation. The record can include the response of the gospel friend and whether he is saved and baptized. If he is ready to be baptized, we can give his name to the deacons, and the church will prepare him for baptism. When he is ready to be baptized, we should speak to him the truth concerning baptism, lead him to have an interview for baptism, and help him to be baptized. He will then be a believer who is in the Triune God and in the church, and our gospel labor on him will be concluded. This person is now a brother or sister in the church and can be handed over to other saints for more edification and perfecting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>This is the general procedure of our preaching the gospel. Even though many saints have experience in this work, we can still have more study and practice. We should not depend on our zeal to invite people, to usher, to sit with others, to have a gospel conversation, or to visit the gospel friends. These matters involve much practice.</p>
<p>We should begin with prayer and deal with our sins. Then we need to learn every step. We need to learn to invite the gospel friends to a meal, to usher, to sit with the gospel friends in the meeting, to have a gospel conversation, to visit the gospel friends, and to lead them to baptism. For the sake of the gospel every brother and sister should learn these steps. We should devote our energy and money to this. The apostle Paul in the New Testament not only spent money and energy for the sake of others&rsquo; souls; he also spent himself (2 Cor. 12:15). This is part of the work of the building up of the church. This is also what the Old Testament says in Haggai 1:8, which says that when we go up to the mountain and bring wood and build God&rsquo;s house, we please God and glorify God.</p>
<p>We preach the gospel so that we can gather more building material. The more we endeavor, the more material there will be. This pleases and glorifies God. May we begin with prayer and continue to learn, study, and practice.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the House of God &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
