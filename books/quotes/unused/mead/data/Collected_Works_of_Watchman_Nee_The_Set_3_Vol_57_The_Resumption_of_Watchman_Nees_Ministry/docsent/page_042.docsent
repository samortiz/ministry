   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Watchman Nee: In tonight's meeting we would like the co-workers to give their own testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those brothers and sisters who are joining us as guests should only come with their ears.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They should not be mouths, nor should they take what they hear and use it as subjects for gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Tonight we want to speak honest words before the Lord and speak the truth in love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>NOT BEING CONTROLLED BY EMOTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Chang Yu-zhi: 1 I find it easy for me to lose my temper and to criticize; 2 I always have strong feelings for injustice in others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Nee: Brother Chang is easily swayed by his emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He does not have much problem with his will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot be influenced by our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What we learn in sickness is a discipline from God through our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>BEING DIRECT AND SIMPLE IN ONE'S MIND</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother David Hsu: 1 I always experience conflicts of various kinds; 2 whenever something happens, I fall into much consideration and my thoughts become very complicated; 3 I also experience conflict between my heart and head.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Nee: We should have thoughts that are like straight lines.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A straight line is the shortest distance between two points.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not have circumventing thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once light comes in and we see ourselves, we should apply the dealing right away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do this, our mind will become simple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having a Definite Burden in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and Speaking into Others' Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In serving the Lord, we have to seek for definite burdens in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must have the Lord's words within before we can speak His word without.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our words are not just spoken for the ears of others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The real speaking is one in which deep calls unto deep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, we should have the spiritual burden within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, our words should be conveyed to the depths of others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Need for Our Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>to Be Short and Direct</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The problem with Brother Hsu is the conveying.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have no way of knowing how much burden there is within him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, he has used so many words and so much time, and yet that which is in his spirit is not yet conveyed to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is because there is not enough practice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, his mind is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we speak, our words have to be short and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brother Hsu's problem is not a problem in the basic matter; it is a problem with his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If he practices more, he will avoid the complications and hesitations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Witness Lee's prayers are "light'' in time and "heavy" in content.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a man needs a glass of water, simply give him a glass.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no need to lay a fifty-yard pipeline first and then put the glass to it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not easy for you to take such words.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not easy for me to speak such words either.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE NEED FOR A STRONG SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>TO RENDER OTHERS THE PRACTICAL HELP</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Jih Yung-tung: I am learning to mingle myself with the other co-workers, but sometimes I become withdrawn because of others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brother Nee: Brother Jih needs to be strengthened in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Real love for the brothers has to do with our being absolute toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This requires that our spirit be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who do not have a strong spirit cannot render others much help in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They cannot build others up, and they cannot cause others to waste themselves on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only those who have a strong spirit can render others the greatest amount of help.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not give others fragmentary and defective help.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, we should render them practical and definite help.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This requires a strong spirit on our part.</S>
