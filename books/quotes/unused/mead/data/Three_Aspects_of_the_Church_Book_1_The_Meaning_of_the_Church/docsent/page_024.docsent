   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Background the World of Idols</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Rebekah originally lived in Paddan-aram Gen 25:20 , an idol-worshipping place usurped by God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The people there opposed God, forsook God, and worshipped idols as their gods.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The birthplace of Rebekah was a world of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, the birthplace of the church is also a world of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before the church was called out, it was in the world of idols where people make a name for themselves, exalt themselves, forsake God, oppose God, put God aside, and give Satan the ground and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was the original condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The focus of this type is not on our living or on sins but on our having being under the authority of the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Calling</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>the Work of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eve as a type of the church reveals how the church was produced, whereas Rebekah typifies how the church was called.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God chose the church before the creation of the world, but His calling occurred in time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Choosing comes first, then calling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God chose the church in eternity before the creation of the world, but God called the church out of the world in time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s calling is based upon His choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God the Father carried out the choosing, and the Holy Spirit carried out the calling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although God s choosing occurred in eternity, His calling was accomplished in time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The place of God the Father s choosing was in the heavens, but the calling of the Holy Spirit was carried out on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In typology, Abraham s sending of his servant to Paddan-aram was God the Father s sending of the Holy Spirit to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The old servant s encounter with Rebekah was a calling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Calling comes out of choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the type of Rebekah shows that the church was chosen out of the world, or we may say that the church was called out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two things are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We use the word calling rather than choosing because calling executes and fulfills the choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God the Father Sending the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Bible readers acknowledge that Abraham typifies God the Father, and the servant, the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abraham s sending of the servant typifies God the Father s sending of the Holy Spirit to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God the Father s choosing of the church is executed through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit executes God s eternal choosing; that is, the Holy Spirit calls the church out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Object of the Calling</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day Abraham said to his servant, You shall go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac Gen 24:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This typifies that when God called the church, He sent the Holy Spirit to work among those who were the same as His Son when His Son was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God was not able to find a counterpart among the angels and the living creatures on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church called by the Holy Spirit had to be of the same race as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hebrews 2:14 says, Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rebekah was of the same race as Isaac, typifying that both Christ and the church share the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Isaac s family was originally from Paddan-aram, and Rebekah was also from Paddan-aram.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ became flesh, and the church is composed of those who share in blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Holy Spirit could not call the church out from among the angels or from among other creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the Holy Spirit came to call the church out from the Adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Arrangement of the Circumstances</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Holy Spirit calls man, His calling is accompanied by an arrangement of circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Holy Spirit called the church, there was also an arrangement of circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Was it a coincidence that Rebekah came out to draw water and was the first to whom the servant spoke Gen 24:15-17 ?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These coincidences were all according to God s arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we consider the history of our being called, we must bow our heads and confess, saying, The circumstances were just right!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If this were not the case, we would not have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, when the Holy Spirit visits a person, a wonderful arrangement of circumstances in the environment takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not coincidence but the sovereign arrangement of the Lord of the universe.</S>
