   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETY-TWO BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROCESS OF MATURITY 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we come to the most pleasant section of the book of Genesis, chapters thirty-seven through fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All children like the stories in these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the writer came to this section, he changed his way of writing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The record of the first thirty-six chapters is brief and emphatic, but the record of the last fourteen chapters is very detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter thirty-seven, for example, contains many details.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This section is so detailed because it is very practical for our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No section in the book of Genesis is more practical than this last section of fourteen chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before we consider chapter thirty-seven, I would like to call your attention back to the beginning of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the reading of any book we must understand the subject, the purpose, of that book.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After reading through the book of Genesis, a book of fifty chapters, you still may not know the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the subject of this book?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was young, I was told that Genesis covers two main things God's creation and man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Genesis begins with the words, "In the beginning God created," and it ends with the words, "He was put in a coffin in Egypt."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was told that because the first verse speaks of God's creation and the last verse speaks about Joseph's being put in a coffin in Egypt, Genesis is a book about God's creation and man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although this view is not wrong, it is a very inadequate understanding of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not easy to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In fact, it is even difficult to understand ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although we have hair on our heads and ten toes on our feet, do hair and toes make a whole man?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Is this a complete person?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the crucial parts and organs, such as the heart and the lungs, are between the hair and the toes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, the most important parts of Genesis are between the first verse and the last verse of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genesis 1:26 is a very crucial verse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion..."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Notice two significant words here image and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yes, man was created by God, and he fell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we must consider in what way and for what purpose man was created.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible says that man was made in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nothing is higher than God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, man was made in the image of the highest One.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps you have never regarded yourself this highly before.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we bear the divine image, we should have a high regard for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not low creatures; we were made for the purpose of expressing God and exercising His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The subject of Genesis is man bearing the image of God and exercising God's dominion over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We bear God's image that we might express Him, and we have God's dominion that we might represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we are God's expression and representation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the heart of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to know this in a progressive way, we need all fifty chapters of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the generations recorded in it Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph are for one purpose: to show that God's economy in the universe is to express Himself through man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is God's purpose, God's goal, and the desire of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's purpose and economy are related to man.</S>
