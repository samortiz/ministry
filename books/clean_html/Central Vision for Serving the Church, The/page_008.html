<h2 class="head1">WORK NEEDING TO PRODUCE FRUIT</h2>
<p>We need to come into the Lord&rsquo;s presence, consider and look to the Lord, and let Him shine upon us anew. We may have fallen into the same condition as the Jewish people. They worshipped God in the temple according to the law of Moses, and we serve in the church according to what we have been taught over the years. We should never think that it is impossible for us to fall into darkness, blindness, and the authority of Satan, as the Jews did. Just as they fell into darkness under the authority of Satan, we can fall and perhaps fall even further.</p>
<p>Every tree is known by its fruit (Matt. 12:33; Luke 6:44); this is an ironclad law in the Bible. Whether our service is good or bad is not determined by the words that we speak but by the fruit that we bear. In order to have proper fruit, we must be in the spirit. The fruit in the churches in the Far East is not convincing evidence that the saints are living in the spirit. I do not say this to condemn others or the church but to remind us of our need to examine ourselves. If we are living in the spirit, where is our fruit? A grain of wheat that falls into the ground and dies bears much fruit (John 12:24). If we say that we are grains of wheat and that we have fallen into the ground and died, where is the issue of our death? If we are the same as those who have no experience of death and bear no fruit, have we truly died? If a grain of wheat bears no fruit, is it any better than a grain of sand? It is useless to debate about the reasons for our fruitlessness; even bandits have reasons for being bandits. We cannot rely just upon words; we must check to see if there is any fruit.</p>
<p>If we have been co-workers or elders for many years but do not have any fruit, we need no further proof of our lack. The fruitlessness of others is not the concern. If we have no fruit ourselves, our work is meaningless. If the Lord came to settle accounts with us today, He would not look at whether we are right about certain things but of whether we have fruit. The churches in the Far East should have a strong ability to beget many children. If the elders, co-workers, and responsible brothers have no children, we will lose a generation over the next ten years. As co-workers who have been working for so many years, we need to ask ourselves who will carry on the work? Where is our next generation? If the co-workers and elders do not produce a new generation, the consequences will be worrisome.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE NEEDING TO BE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Following Methods</h2>
<p>A responsible brother once promoted the matter of rising up at 5:30 in the morning for morning watch, but his promotion yielded no fruit, because he was promoting only human diligence. Being diligent, however, is not the same as being spiritual. Although it is difficult to know whether something is spiritual, it is easier to know whether something is not spiritual. Although few saints can give a clear definition of spirituality, everyone knows whether the promotion of a certain practice in the church is spiritual, especially when the promotion is not in the spirit. Diligence and faithfulness are valuable in every human circumstance but not necessarily in the spiritual realm. Spirituality is related to the release of the spirit. A brother should never stir up people to simply rise up at 5:30 in the morning. For the sake of the saints, it would be better if he slept more. This would be his salvation. Although it would be good if slothful ones would rise earlier, it would be better if this brother would rise later. The more he promoted rising early in the meeting, the more he deadened the meeting. His good intentions produced the opposite effect, and it was easier for the saints to receive a supply of life when he did not speak.</p>
<p>Whenever we are given an opportunity, we look for methods. In 1968 the churches in the Far East began to imitate the churches in America by being loud, but soon there was no spirit or even a taste for this. Just as being quiet is not necessarily a matter in the spirit, neither is being loud necessarily a matter in the spirit. I have no desire that we become a &ldquo;loud church&rdquo; or a &ldquo;quiet church&rdquo; but rather a &ldquo;living-in-the-spirit church.&rdquo; The spirit is living and spontaneous, causes no confusion, and does not necessarily forbid a particular practice. Whatever is of the spirit causes people to touch the spirit; whatever is not of the spirit damages the church. There are no set church practices. I deeply feel that the churches in the Far East have grown accustomed to a living that looks for and follows methods while neglecting the matter of living in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Too Confident</h2>
<p>I hope that we will examine ourselves under the Lord&rsquo;s light. According to our present situation, almost all the co-workers and elders need a &ldquo;surgical operation.&rdquo; We are like a couple who has been married for thirty years but has no children; our lack of fruit must be due to some &ldquo;illness.&rdquo; Truthfully, I have no way of knowing the details of our various situations; I can only point out that we have no fruit. We need to go before the Lord and examine our situation to determine the reason for our lack of fruit. The elders especially need to do this. Some elders have no fruit because they trust only themselves. A person who does not trust others has too much confidence in his own meticulous considerations and actions. Although he may derive some human benefit from his conduct, there is nothing spiritual about his conduct because it comes entirely from his good self. We must be in spirit in order to produce fruit. Our meticulous considerations cannot produce fruit, and the &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; that it can produce is not needed in the church.</p>
<p>Although the elders need to be broken and to pass through the dealing of the cross, this subject seems to have become old. When I speak on the breaking and the dealing of the cross today, there is not much response. The best speaker on the breaking of the cross was Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis, whom the Lord raised up fifty years ago. Many saints throughout America have her books in their homes, but these books are practically useless. It is hard to find anyone who has read her books and experienced being genuinely broken. People may hear a message, but they have no ear for it. This does not mean that the truth of the breaking of the cross is not the truth. Although this truth is still the truth, the emphasis in this age is not on the breaking of the cross. Truth is needed according to the age. Therefore, it is not enough for me to speak only on the breaking of the cross. Every businessman knows that items that were highly sought after fifty years ago may be undesirable today, even to antique dealers. The truth is always the truth, but we must pay attention to the need of the age.</p>
