<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Israel, Having Become<br>the People of Jehovah Their God,<br>Listening to His Voice and<br>Doing His Commandments and His Statutes</H2><P>Moses, with the Levitical priests, spoke to all Israel that from that day they had become the people of Jehovah their God; therefore they were charged to listen to His voice and do His commandments and His statutes (vv. 9-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Moses Commanding That<br>Six of the Tribes Should Stand<br>upon Mount Gerizim to Bless the People<br>and That Six Tribes Should Stand<br>upon Mount Ebal for Cursing</H2><P>Moses commanded the people that six of the tribes of Israel&#151;Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin&#151;should stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people (vv. 11-12). Moses also commanded that the other six tribes&#151; Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali&#151;should stand upon Mount Ebal for cursing (v. 13). Concerning which group they would be in, the tribes had no choice but had to accept God's ordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Levites Responding</H2><P>The Levites were to respond and, speaking to the people with a loud voice, were to utter the curses recorded in verses 15 through 26.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Ones Who Were to Be Cursed</H2><P>To each of the curses in 27:15-26, the people were to say, "Amen." The ones who were cursed included the following: the man who makes an idol (v. 15); the man who dishonors his parents (v. 16); the man who moves his neighbor's boundary mark (v. 17); the man who leads astray a blind man on the way (v. 18); the man who distorts justice due a sojourner, an orphan, or a widow (v. 19); the man who lies with his father's wife (v. 20); the man who lies with an animal (v. 21); the man who lies with his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter (v. 22); the man who lies with his mother-in-law (v. 23); the man who slays his neighbor secretly (v. 24); the man who takes payment to slay someone of innocent blood (v. 25); and the man who does not confirm all the words of this law by doing them (v. 26).</P>
