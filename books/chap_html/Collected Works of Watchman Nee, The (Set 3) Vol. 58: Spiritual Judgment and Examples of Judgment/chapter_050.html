L.</h2><p>I do not know the exact date when I was saved. My parents were both Christians, and I am by nature a quiet person. When I was ten years old, I began to sit through sermons. Because my older brother and sister passed away early, I became the darling of the family. While I was in medical school, I heard Dr. Stearn's preaching. Some of the words pricked my heart. At that time I was busy with my school work. One day I became sick with an almost incurable illness. I prayed, "Lord, if You heal me, I will consecrate myself to You." I became well soon after that. The matter was forgotten, and I put away my consecration. Although I read the Bible often, I had no desire to seek after the Lord. In 1942 the church received me, and in 1943 the Lord wanted me to offer up my possessions to Him. After I made the offering, I became proud, thinking that I had done something that deserved merit. The Lord's word came to me: "I love mercy, not sacrifice."</p><p>In spiritual things, I am easily affected. Some time ago I became sick again. This time I needed long-term convalescence. I stayed in bed for a few months. Because of my prolonged stay in the hospital, I neglected my family. As a result, my wife and I were not in harmony very much. When my children were disobedient and my wife reported these things to me, I would become unhappy. One day the Lord seemed to say to me, "Honor your wife." I did not agree in my heart, because I thought that my wife was the one who should submit to me. Later I saw that I was actually behind my wife in everything, and I began to honor her. Once I obeyed the Lord this way, the problems in the family went away. It is the Lord's mercy that I am able to come up to the mountain without many hindrances.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>First Corinthians 7:14 says, "The unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy." The gospel preacher always tells others that there is no middle ground. Actually, between salvation and perdition there is another ground. An unbelieving wife is different from other kinds of wives. Although children born into Christian families are not automatically saved, they are on a different ground. They are closer to the Lord, but few of them ever are saved in a dramatic way.</p><p>God deals with men in fragmentary, fundamental, or supplementary ways. Sometimes God deals with men in a fragmentary way. At other times He deals with men in a fundamental way. At still other times He deals with them in a supplementary way. Supplementary dealing is similar to fragmentary dealing, except that the significance of the two dealings is different. Supplementary dealing is additional; it is something added to a fundamental dealing. Fragmentary dealings are like symptomatic cures in medical treatment. Fundamental dealings are like major operations, and supplementary dealings are like post-operative treatments of supplemental medications that help recover the health of the body. Fragmentary dealings must be accompanied by fundamental dealings before the former will become beneficial to a person. If there are no fundamental dealings, the fragmentary dealings will become a frustration to the fundamental dealings. After there are fundamental dealings, supplementary dealings come as an added benefit. Outwardly, fragmentary dealings appear to be the same as supplementary dealings, but they are not the same inwardly. The main difference is in the experience of a fundamental dealing. Once a person has a fundamental dealing, all fragmentary dealings become supplementary dealings. Our brother was raised up in a Christian family. The Lord has not dealt with him in any drastic way. It seems as if it is easy for him to simply pick up supplementary dealings. This is a great blessing. He has an advantage over others in that he can be spared of many miscellaneous dealings and can save some time.</p><p>In our course of following the Lord, there are many big things and big revelations that we have to see. We should not be distracted by the small things. If there are supplementary dealings, we have to accept them. When the Lord is doing something big, however, we should not be held down by small things. We have to learn to pay attention to the big things. If the president of a nation is conducting a meeting on national policy, and his wife cables and tells him that the servant has overcooked the rice, the president should not tend to such a small matter, even though his wife or servant may think that it is a big matter. The same can be said of our Christian experience; we should not allow the small things in our living to affect the big things. Today God is doing many big things in the believers and in the church. But He often is frustrated because the believers have set their eyes on small things. Our brother's view should be uplifted to see the big things. In order to take care of the overall need, he should turn away from insignificant and unrelated things. The experiences you had in the past can be considered as God's supplementary work in you. However, you have overlooked the fundamental and great things. Our brother has indeed been taking a straight course, but as he just now confessed, he is afraid of being influenced by others. It seems as if he has to be led by the hand before he can walk. I hope that in the coming days our brother will place his attention on gaining knowledge of the major things.</p>
