<h2 class="head2">To Work by Contacting People in Preaching<br />
the High Gospel, in Teaching the Deeper Truths, and in Testifying the Christian Experience</h2>
<p>We also need to work by contacting people in preaching the high gospel, in teaching the deeper truths, and in testifying the Christian experience. We should always practice to contact people one by one. We should not try to preach to a group. We may speak to fifty persons at one time, but eventually we may gain none of these fifty. The most effective way is to contact people one by one.</p>
<p>We need to preach the high gospel. We should not be influenced by the old concept that people will not understand us if we share things that are deep and high. The thoughtful people want to hear the deeper truths concerning the real meaning of human life.</p>
<p>It is possible that we could share with someone about Genesis 1 in the deepest way. We could ask them to read this chapter with us. Then we could say, &ldquo;Here it says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The first thing God did was to call light into being, and then God made the air. Later, God caused the dry land to appear for the existence of the plants, the animals, and man. He created man in His image according to His likeness. In Genesis 1 we see the plant life, the animal life, and the human life, but this is not the highest life. The highest life is seen in the next chapter, and that is the tree of life. For our existence we need the light, the air, and the land, but we are also human beings in God&rsquo;s image according to God&rsquo;s likeness. God&rsquo;s intention is for us to have His life.&rdquo; We can then grasp the opportunity to ask them to pray with us and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>If we shared the truth from Genesis 1 with them in such a way, they would wonder where we learned all these things. We can tell them, &ldquo;I was a Christian for years and I did not know these things. But one day I read a message which pointed out all these things in Genesis 1.&rdquo; This will lead them into a further seeking of the divine truths. The next time we see them, we could fellowship with them about the tree of life.</p>
<p>We can speak the high gospel to people from any part of the Bible. It is even possible to preach the gospel from the beginning of Matthew 1. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.&rdquo; From this point, we can say something about Christ. Then we can proceed by telling the stories about David and Abraham. We can eventually arrive at the point of the Lord Jesus being the Redeemer and the Savior.</p>
<p>We all have to learn the truths. The entire New Testament has been expounded by us, so we have to study this exposition. From the middle of August to the middle of December, we will have a special four-month training to equip the burdened ones to go to Europe. This equipping will mainly be accomplished by an intensified study of the Life-study messages. After the saints have applied for this four-month training, there will be a process of being accepted to the training, being educated, being trained, and eventually passing the training. All of us need to study the divine truths in the printed ministry to equip us for the preaching of the high gospel.</p>
<p>We should fully abandon the old, traditional, natural way of preaching the gospel. We must have a change to the scriptural, uplifted way of preaching the gospel. Even the way of teaching mathematics has been absolutely changed from the way of teaching years ago. In order to teach the truths properly, we need to get ourselves qualified. We may feel that we need a lot of time to become qualified, but we do not need that much time. The special four-month training we will have from August through December will help us to become qualified. We may feel that we cannot make it, but the training will help us to make it.</p>
<p>We need to be equipped to teach the deeper truths of God&rsquo;s economy to those in Europe. Most in Christianity do not know the high gospel or the deeper truths. Furthermore, because of the clergy-laity system, they have not been trained to function as living members of the Body of Christ. We need to change our way. The clergy-laity system offends the Lord because it annuls the use of the members of Christ. The Lord wants every member of the entire Body of Christ to work, to function.</p>
<p>The traditional way of Christianity with one man speaking and the rest listening kills the members of the Body of Christ. All the saints can speak for the Lord. To oppose the God- ordained way is to oppose the Lord. The clergy-laity system of Christianity annuls the ability, capacity, gifts, and functions of the saints. When we go to Europe, we need to forget about serving in the way of one person speaking to a congregation. Instead, we should spend our time contacting people one by one. Then we can bring the ones helped by us to a home of the saints near the campus. Spontaneously, we will nourish the ones under our care. We will obey the Lord&rsquo;s charge to feed His lambs.</p>
<p>I would ask the leading ones to consider their situation. We may have been managing the church for years with little result. Should we not have a change? Today Taiwan makes much money because they have changed much within the last twenty years. We need the training. The training helps us to change.</p>
