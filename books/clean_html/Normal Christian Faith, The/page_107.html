<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WRONG PERSON</H2><P>If a Christian does not know the order of God's work, and if he gives up the work of evangelism to engage himself in social and political reforms, the result is not merely a matter of right or wrong, it is a dead-end street.</P><P>All the problems of today are caused by man being out of order. It is because man is evil that the system becomes evil. Since man is evil, no system can be good. Even if he is able to set up a good system, his evil nature still does not change, and he can do nothing. There are a number of philosophies which are lofty and logical, but under the hand of corrupted man, nothing can be achieved. However, if the man is right, it does not matter if the system is a little faulty. But if the man is wrong, a good system is useless. The first coming of Christ was for securing men. Without men He has no way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PARABLE OF THE WORLD</H2><P>We have to look at one passage in the Scripture to see how Christ deals with the world. First we will look at the parable and then the explanation.</P><P>Matthew 13:24-30 says, "Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field. But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away. And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares appeared also. And the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did the tares come from? And he said to them, An enemy has done this. And the slaves said to him, Do you want us then to go and collect them? But he said, No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them. Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn."</P><P>Again, read verses 36 to 40 of the same chapter. "Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Make the parable of the tares of the field clear to us. And He answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one; and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels. Therefore just as the tares are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the consummation of the age."</P>
