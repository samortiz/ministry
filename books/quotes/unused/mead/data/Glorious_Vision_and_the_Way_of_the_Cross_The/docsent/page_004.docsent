   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S CALLING BEING HIS PERSONAL REVELATION TO US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How does God call us?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He calls us by drawing us to Himself through opening Himself up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In some places in the world, there are night markets.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The merchants there lay out their beautiful, bargain goods by bundles and cases before the customers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This gives people a strong impression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many are attracted by these night markets and shop there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I hope that some among you will see God Himself in a similar way and will be captured by such a glorious vision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I still remember the experience of the God of glory appearing to me for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was on the afternoon of the day I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I walked out of the meeting hall into the street, I felt that everything was different.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I stopped by the road and prayed to God, "God!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I don't want anything else anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I only want Yourself."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the God of glory appearing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hope that in principle, you would all have the same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not be like the Christian missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They serve the Lord as a profession.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that every one serving the Lord in His recovery would have this glorious vision breaking and shining upon him at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not a matter of any outward seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, it is a definite and glorious inward seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A VISION THAT TURNS THE WHOLE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After we have this glorious seeing, our entire being will be changed in its concept, attitude, conversation, and thought.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will be thoroughly different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we still eat, drink, rest, and work, our whole person will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a response to our seeing a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we see a vision we have a response.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, when you go to the zoo and see a fierce tiger, you will surely have a response.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The vision that you see will make you beside yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your concepts will be changed, and your walk and living will become uncommon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I still remember the condition I was in when I was called immediately after I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Others began to feel differently about me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only did outsiders feel differently about me, even my own family felt that I was different.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They thought that I was depressed or that I did not sleep well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They observed that I began to lose interest in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although all of you may not be the same as I was, I do believe that a good number of brothers and sisters have had a similar experience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others notice that we are different.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps the change does not occur the day we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But three days later, or three months, perhaps even three years later, there is a thorough change.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sooner or later, the appearing of God and our spiritual vision will make us different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The world can never explain this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They cannot understand it, because they have never seen anything like it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, we know that after seeing such a vision, our whole life-style is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, formerly I may have loved the world very much, but now I gladly relinquish it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Money becomes tasteless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Fashion becomes tasteless, and amusement becomes tasteless.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything becomes tasteless.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The wonderful thing is that, on the positive side, the word of the Lord becomes tasteful, and God becomes attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who do not understand this may think that we have a mental problem, because our reaction is too different and too extraordinary!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, we know that there is nothing wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The only thing that happened is that our whole being has had an inward turn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From that day on, for us the world changed its color.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was a genuine change.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This world has become absolutely tasteless to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the positive side, our life becomes full of meaning, glory, and purpose because of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This proves that we have seen the glorious vision.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When this God of glory unveils Himself to us, our lives are changed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This can neither be imitated nor denied.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For a while, you may become somewhat cold, or weak, or may be slightly backslidden, or depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But you cannot forget the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even if you go back to the world and desire for the world, the feeling within you will not be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You will sense no taste for it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God will raise up an environment to turn you back.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He will unveil His glory to you again and will make you consecrate yourself back to this God of glory.</S>
