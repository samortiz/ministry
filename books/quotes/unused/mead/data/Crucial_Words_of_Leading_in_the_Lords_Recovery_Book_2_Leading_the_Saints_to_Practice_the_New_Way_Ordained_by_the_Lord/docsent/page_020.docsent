   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After much study and discussion, we can say that we have come to the definite conclusion that preaching the gospel by visiting people and knocking on doors is the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The result of preaching the gospel in this way depends upon how we labor; this way definitely works and is by comparison the most effective way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After people have been visited and baptized, there is no other way that will cause them to grow in life as steadily as the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Consequently, we need further study in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Human beings are living; they are not pieces of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If this way does not work, we will step back and find another way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever the case, we will gradually find a way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All of us need to practice in our localities according to what has been fellowshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regardless of the way we use, we need to be flexible; that is, we cannot be rigid and unchangeable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For instance, if what we practice this week does not work well, we will need to adjust our way the following week.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even after we have adjusted to the right way, we still need to observe it over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In short, the responsible brothers in all the churches need to promote this matter; however, they should not force the brothers and sisters but should exhort, lead, and encourage them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not everyone in the church needs to be involved in visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is good if twenty, thirty, or even forty are able to go out, while the rest bear the responsibility to pray much for the saints visiting the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way they can give themselves in prayer to the way that God has ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to let the saints know that if they do not go out to visit people, they can still participate; we are in one corporate move.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who stay behind to pray need those who visit the new ones, and those who visit the new ones need those who stay behind to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This can be likened to the time of David in the Old Testament when some went out to fight on the battlefield, while others stayed home for defense; both aspects are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way the whole church will be brought into one practice, which will gradually become the family tradition of preaching the gospel among the churches in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This does not mean that this is the only way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are many ways to preach the gospel, but in comparison, this way is the most effective.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As long as we are willing to pay the price and spend time and energy, we will surely gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While we are not sure if any other way is effective in gaining people, this way is definitely effective in gaining people; however, this way also demands paying the greatest price.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Other ways to preach the gospel do not require as high of a price; this way surely requires paying a high price.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that when the elders fellowship with the saints regarding this matter, they would fellowship with them in a thorough manner, and at the same time they would work out a definite way for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the beginning they should explain to the brothers and sisters that their going out to visit people and preach the gospel is to consecrate themselves not only to the church but also to the Lord and that the responsible brothers in the church will assist them, help them, and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way everyone will gradually be on the right track, and the way that God has ordained will become the atmosphere among us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If all the churches work hard in this endeavor, this practice will certainly become our family tradition within a year.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The churches in the different localities can set the time for the prayer meeting and home meetings according to their particular need.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These matters can be determined in accordance with the particular situation of a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The important thing is that there must be a group of saints who knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This group of saints is a crucial link without which hardly anyone will be added to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we want the church to have an increase in number, there must be this link, and among those who are brought in by this group, at least one-third will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If one hundred people are gained in this term, at least thirty will remain in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are more diligent, even more people will remain; the percentage of people who remain altogether depends upon our diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we visit and take care of people continually, it will be rare for people to make excuses and withdraw.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This way is certain and workable, and it guarantees an increase and multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This way must be built up among us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that we will constantly pray for the churches in Taiwan to practice and promote this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We desire to see that the number of people in the churches in the Lord s recovery will have a significant increase from 1988 onward and that this matter will build up a kind of atmosphere, a family tradition, in the Lord s recovery.</S>
