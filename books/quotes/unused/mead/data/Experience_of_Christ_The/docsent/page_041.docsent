   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we want to participate in Christ, experience Christ, and enjoy Christ, we must repudiate our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The greatest obstacle to enjoying Christ is our natural heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, the greatest hindrance for a naturally gentle brother to enjoy Christ is his gentleness, for he may repudiate all things except his gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we have enjoyed Christ to a certain degree, we all have been frustrated and hindered by our natural heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the good flesh that is the greatest hindrance to experiencing Christ and enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose a certain person is naturally eloquent and makes a great impact upon an audience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he becomes a Christian, he can be an outstanding preacher and draw a great crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being naturally eloquent, he can be influential and have a great impact.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But there will be no need for Christ or for the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With his natural eloquence, he can secure a large following.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I were such an eloquent speaker, you all would appreciate me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You would praise the Lord that such a brother had been brought into the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, it is difficult for such an eloquent speaker to enjoy Christ in his speaking because he has no need of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose another person is not born with the ability to speak eloquently.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the contrary, he is slow and halting in his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever he speaks more than a few minutes, everyone falls asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose he gets saved, loves the Lord and the church, and has a burden to speak a word for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Having no trust in himself, he spontaneously repudiates himself and puts all his trust in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He may fast and pray desperately to the Lord, saying, "Lord, if You don't speak, I will not be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If You don't do something with my speaking, I am finished."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he stands up to speak, he is in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But because he has repudiated himself, he experiences Christ and enjoys Christ as he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A naturally eloquent brother may have the same experience, for with him the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He may pray, "Lord, I am in fear and trembling that my eloquence and intelligence might replace You and that my ability might hinder You and keep me from enjoying You.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, as I speak I have no trust in my natural ability."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way he denies himself and repudiates his ability, eloquence, intelligence, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, when he speaks, he also experiences Christ and enjoys Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter whether we are dull or intelligent, we must reject all that we are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nothing natural should be allowed to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Any naturally good thing will frustrate us from the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
