A sweet thought recorded in the Word of God is that God is not only near us but that He has even given Himself to us to be our enjoyment
Before we eat, the food is not a part of us, but after we take it in, it becomes our nutritional supply and strength
The relationship between food and our physical body is similar to the relationship between God and our entire being
We can enjoy God in His sovereign arrangements and provisions, and we can enjoy Him as the varied supply to our inward being
Since God is so intimately related to us, the Bible uses many ways to describe and illustrate our enjoyment of God
We can say boldly that if a person does not have God within him as life, he has not come up to the standard of a human being
Although there is a certain degree of magnanimity and tolerance in man's natural life, these virtues are limited
When the infinite God enters into us and becomes the highest life within us, we become persons of an infinitely high standard
We can love what others cannot love, we can endure what others cannot endure, and we can forgive what others cannot forgive
The Bible describes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost as a rushing violent wind, which was God Himself
The Lord Jesus also came to the disciples on the evening of His resurrection and breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
In this way our whole being is saturated with the Spirit as breath; that is, we are full of the presence of the Spirit
The young people among us who are not yet married can see the relationship between a husband and wife from their parents
When the Lord Jesus came to the earth His forerunner John the Baptist declared Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
He said that the manna in the Old Testament was only a type and that He was the bread that comes down from heaven
The Lord also said that He would be lifted up and that His body would be broken and out of it would flow living water
When the Holy Spirit enters man, He satisfies man's thirst and flows out of man as a river of living water to quench the thirst of others
Without a dwelling place, we have no habitation, no place of rest, no place to set our feet, and no place to work
In the daytime we have the light of the sun, and at night we have the light of the moon, the stars, and even lamps
We need to know when to move and when to stop, when to go forward or backward, and when to turn left or turn right
When we read through the Bible and realize that it presents God as everything to us, we cannot help but praise Him
Just as He was happy to speak with the immoral Samaritan woman by the well in Sychar , He is happy to contact us, the despicable sinners
If we have revelation we will see that while He is high and lofty the Lord of glory and holiness He also loves to dispense Himself into us
Every child of God needs to realize that the God whom we worship and serve is not the God of our religious concept
Even though our God is the Lord of all, He has lowered Himself, humbled Himself, to the extent that He has become the same as we are
He did this in order to make Himself available to us for our enjoyment and so that we can gain Him and experience Him
The Chinese character for forget is also composed of the root words for heart and dead, but the character for heart is turned on its side
The way a matter is spoken of the first time determines the meaning of similar matters that are mentioned subsequently
After God created man, He placed him in front of the tree of life so that man would enjoy the fruit of that tree
God's first thought after creating man was for man to eat and drink, and the object of this eating and drinking was God Himself
If we read the four Gospels carefully, we will see that the people who came to the Lord had many different opinions concerning Him
He does not bargain with us whenever He fellowships and communes with us; rather, He presents Himself for our enjoyment
According to the Bible, after creating Adam, God did not say, 'You must worship Me in this way,' or 'You must serve Me in that way'
One day the tree of life came as the Word who became flesh, who tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality
In the four Gospels those who came to Him asked what they should do and which was the great commandment in the law
Man's natural concept has dominated Christianity for two thousand years, and we are still not set free from its influence today
God has no intention for us to do anything for Him, and He has no desire for us to accomplish anything for Him
When we enjoy Him and allow Him to become our blessed portion, all His riches become our supply and inwardly fill us
Although the branches of a fruit-bearing tree may bear much fruit, none of the fruit is the result of the work of the branches
If we say to the branches, 'You have worked too hard,' they will respond, 'This is not true; we are simply bearing fruit'
We are wrong because we focus on things rather than on God; we lay hold of things rather than of God; we pray for things rather than for God
As we contact Him, He will give us a sense that there may be problems, obstacles, and barriers between us and Him
We can worship Him and, beholding His beauty in His presence, we can pray: 'Lord, You are altogether lovely and sweet
As we fellowship with Him this way, we not only stop praying for the message, but we also forget about the message
When we are filled with Him in this way we may not think of the word patience at any time but nevertheless experience patience in our living
Although the word patience is not in our thoughts, and we do not speak of it, our daily life will be filled with patience
After absorbing the Lord and being filled with Him, we will not be the one speaking when we contact our professor
The words that we speak will be the very Lord whom we have absorbed, and it will be impossible for others not to be blessed
Moses spent forty days and forty nights on the mountain before Jehovah, doing nothing other than absorbing Him
He did not feel anything when he came down from the mountain, but the children of Israel saw the shining of his face
When he presented himself before men, he did not need to say anything concerning God; they saw God's glory in his face
If we forget about power and instead fellowship with God, absorb Him, and enjoy Him, we will have power without being conscious of it
Some have said, 'Brother Lee, the more we seek the Lord's leading, the more confused we are, and the easier it is for us to make mistakes
After praying, they consider the options and then decide which option is according to the Lord's will and leading
We do not have the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud if we are the only one speaking, and God is not speaking
As God's children, we need to change our concept and see that God's only desire is to give Himself to us to be our enjoyment
When we pray, there is no need for us to be concerned about our difficulties and burdens, such as a seriously ill child
When they come to the Lord in the morning, they should behold His beauty, absorb Him, receive Him, and enjoy Him
The Bible unveils that throughout the ages God has been doing one thing in man: He has been mingling Himself with man
He is seen as the sovereign One far away in the heavens, and men on earth are expected to worship and serve Him
He wants to be the love in our emotion, the thoughts in our mind, and the decisions and deliberations in our will
If we look deeper we will find that within this man there was unfathomable wisdom unlimited power immeasurable life and eternal discernment
Brothers and sisters, we must realize that unless God is mingled with us in our worship and service, they are not worth anything before God
When we are going to preach the gospel, we need to remember that the Lord, who is mingled with us, should be the one preaching the gospel
When we are praying, the Lord must be the one who is praying through us, that is, praying by mingling Himself with us
The real preaching and release of the Lord's message is one in which the Lord in His humanity speaks through us
If we are living as an individual person, we are not living like a Christian; we are merely living like a human being
Only when we allow Him to fill us and become every part of our being can we truly know Him as He desires to be known
Even though we have spoken of this matter often in the past, for the sake of the new ones we need to repeat this point
After he has possessed these things and has tasted of their enjoyment, he will become keenly aware of yet another need deep in his being
When he suffers greatly, experiences extreme poverty, or is sick to the point of dying, he begins to think about God
Even when animals are at the height of their excitement or suffering, they will not turn to God or worship God
When he is brought to extreme circumstances, either extreme elation or extreme desperation, the need in his spirit is made manifest
There is a spirit within man, and God created man with this spirit in order that he could receive and enjoy Him
The difference between the Lord Jesus and us is that every part within us is man, but every part within Him was God
Whenever filthy and dirty men, such as we, want to fellowship with God, who is absolutely holy, the blood is needed
In order for there to be fellowship between God and us, there is not only the need of life but also the need of the blood
As such, we are thankful to the Lord that His blood cleanses us from every sin and enables us to fellowship with Him
There is still a hidden problem in our being, which is the problem of the flesh, the self, the natural man, and the old creation
When he comes before God, he may be full of the self, full of his own views, his own thoughts, and his own desires
In the fourth step, after our Lord was crucified on the cross, He resurrected from the dead and became the Spirit
After the Lord Jesus' resurrection, the mingling of God and man was complete; God had entered into man, and man had entered into God
On the cross He shed His blood to remove the barrier of sin between Him and us, and He dealt with the self and the old creation
When sugar, grape juice, and other ingredients are added to a glass of water, it is still a glass of water in a general sense
As we practice living in this Spirit, we will gradually experience all these elements that God has accomplished for us
In order to exercise our spirit when we come to God, we should pray according to the feeling deep within our being
It is right for us to exercise our mind when we are at school, but it is altogether wrong to exercise our mind in this way when we pray
Although it is something real and substantial, if we do not have eyes or if we are blind, we will be unable to see this substance
The moment he kneels down, he will exercise his spirit instead of wandering in his mind with different thoughts
While we are praying with an exercised spirit, a thought may suddenly come to us concerning our work or our family
May we learn to follow the steps that God has taken in the work He has accomplished in order for us to contact Him
According to the common religious concept, God is far away in the heavens, and man on earth needs to worship Him
His sole intention is to come down from heaven to earth, enter into man, dwell inside of man, and mingle Himself with man
Although God dwells in His sanctuary in the highest and no one can touch Him, He desires to dwell with the contrite
If we are the only ones praying, and God is not mingled in our prayer, praying together with us, our prayer has only one nature
Andrew Murray once said that every prayer of true worth is a prayer in which the Christ within us prays to the Christ on the throne
In the example of a sister who thinks about her husband and children when she prays, the prayer was with the mind
The more they pray the drier they will become the farther they will be from God and the harder it will be for them to sense Gods presence
In proper prayer, either before or during our prayer, the Holy Spirit will initiate something within our spirit
When the Holy Spirit pushes us again, we will pray further, 'Lord, open our eyes to see that You are enjoyable'
It seems as if we are the ones uttering these words, but actually the Holy Spirit is prompting us inwardly to utter these words
When we come to God, exercise our spirit, and learn to cooperate and be mingled with Him, we will discover that we have two problems
The more we go to God and exercise our spirit to cooperate with Him, the more we will be mingled with God and sense the need for the blood
Whenever we touch our spirit, and whenever we touch God and sense His presence and mingling, we will realize that we are unclean
Even if we spend one hour praying for cleansing, we will still need the cleansing of the blood in the next hour
In the morning we should each touch the Lord's presence, turn to our spirit, and pray by being mingled with Him
Once we touch God and cooperate with Him, light will shine in us, and we will see that we are defiled in this item and wrong in that item
While we confess this, a third thought may come to us related to pride in our demeanor when we spoke with a brother
As soon as we utter these words, another thought may come that we were improper in our behavior toward our household help
After confessing, he simply made a short intercession at the end: 'God, remember Your holy habitation and Your holy city for Your own sake'
Over ninety percent of that long prayer was confession; only the last part was intercession, but this was enough to touch God's heart
He touches God and senses His presence, and God's light shines on him, exposing all his failures and hidden thoughts
He sees that the blood of the cross is not only for saving him from hell but also for maintaining his fellowship with God
The Lord's Word says that we should seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to us
When we discover any sin in us, we should confess, ask for the cleansing of the blood, and enjoy the redemption that comes through the cross
In the same principle, when the Spirit exposes the self, we have no choice but to accept the death of the cross
In our fellowship with God in His presence we will experience the death of Christ in a very real and practical way
On the one hand, we will experience the cleansing of the blood; on the other hand, we will experience the death of the cross
As we experience the first three steps, we spontaneously will experience the fourth step, which is to be in resurrection
Our sins will be cleansed, the self will be crucified, and our entire being will be in the Spirit of resurrection
In this redemption we are put to death, and the Spirit of resurrection brings us into the realm of resurrection
We should never think that as soon as one becomes a Christian, he automatically knows how to pray and read the Word
Everything that we have in our natural being can be compared to carbon dioxide, and everything that God is can be compared to oxygen
We may be full of sorrow and grief, but as soon as we come to God and breathe out, the sorrow and grief are gone
Although these points do not have a legal or fixed order, we should learn to behold the beauty of the Lord in silence
There are times when we do things according to the index of a person's eyes; we speak according to the expression on their face
How does this sister know that God wants to heal her husband promptly or to make him healthier than he was before?
Rather, He said that He was the resurrection and the life, and although her brother was dead, he would rise again
After she said this, she went and called her sister secretly to meet the Lord, saying, 'The Teacher is here and is calling you'
The Lord, however, told them to do as He said and then cried out in a loud voice, saying, 'Lazarus, come out'!
We are not used to beholding His loveliness in silence; we are not used to living according to the index of His eyes
The Lord can save a brother if he is sick, He can resurrect him even if he has died, and He can make him fresh even if he smells
If we have never touched God and have never been calm before Him or never beheld His loveliness, we do not know the meaning of inquiring
We must meditate on God's loveliness, His lovingkindness, His dignity, His glory, His attributes, and His acts
We should not think that it is a waste of time to temporarily set aside other matters in our prayers while we meditate on God
As we touch Him remain in Him behold His loveliness converse with Him inquire of Him wait on Him and muse upon Him we should worship Him
As we remain in God, muse upon Him, worship Him, and praise Him, He reveals His desire to us, and we intercede by inquiring
Many times in our prayers we go away as soon as we have finished speaking rather than letting God go away when He is finished speaking
If we always pray in this way, we will surely receive and appropriate much more of God, and He will surely be our real enjoyment
Although many people pray, they do not contact God, and although many people study the Word, they do not absorb God
In the last chapter we pointed out that prayer is not asking God to do many things, but it is breathing in God
When we study the Word, we should not look for teachings, just as when we pray, we should not ask for many things
Just as we breathe ourselves out and breathe in God through prayer, we deny ourselves and receive all that God is through reading the Word
Whenever we come to the Bible, we should not have the concept that it is for the purpose of gaining some teachings
The proper attitude for every child of God when coming to the Word is to consider it as another opportunity to contact God Himself
Not only are all things created by God's word, but the very existence of all things is also sustained by His word
We are regenerated by His word, and every spiritual experience we have after our regeneration comes as a result of God's word
Even though they may be attracted by movies, an avid moviegoer will still be bored if he visits the theater every day
We can cause people to sit still with a few words, and we can cause them to stand up and leave with a few words
The first thought we should have, the first step we should take, when we open the Scriptures is to prepare ourselves to contact God
Rather, we are altogether contacting the manifested God, the God who has revealed Himself through His speaking
The God who dwells in unapproachable light, who cannot be touched or known, has revealed Himself through the Word
When we come to the Bible, we should have the consciousness that we are contacting the revealed and released God
We should exercise our mind when we read a newspaper, asking ourselves about the content of an article or an editorial
We must believe that the more we turn from our mind to our spirit, our reading of the Scriptures will be proper
Those who are able to read the Bible need to turn from their mind and exercise their spirit in order to receive any benefit
When he comes out of his library, he will be irritable; any slight provocation will cause him to lose his temper
At this juncture we can muse and consider and even turn our thoughts into prayer, saying, 'God, may You be the beginning in all my ways
When we contact Him, we should spontaneously turn our understanding into meditation and prayer and concentrate on absorbing God Himself
We should never congratulate ourselves for merely understanding some truths which we formerly did not understand
If the result of our coming to the Word is to receive knowledge, teaching, or truth, not the Lord Himself, our reading is a failure
When we read the Word, the ultimate result should not merely be the acquisition of more truth but the gaining of the Lord Himself
We are contacting the Lord, receiving the Lord, and praying to the Lord; therefore, in the end we should gain the Lord
As we touch the Lord, we may feel peaceful and sense that the Lord's presence is with our business, enabling us to proceed with our business
As we contact the living Lord and as His element within us increases, He, the living God Himself, becomes our living guidance
Whenever our spirit touches the living word of God, we will surely be enlivened, refreshed, enriched, enlightened, and empowered
He may decline because he is very clear in his spirit yet at the same time be unable to explain his reason for declining
Even though this type of knowing is not dependent upon our understanding, there is a clear shining in our spirit
When we read the Bible, we should realize that God is contained in His Word, and we should contact it in this way
Consequently we will gain more of the Lord absorb more of Him and our inner being will be enlivened refreshed strengthened and enlightened
Rather, it is an inward enjoyment that can be compared to the enjoyment one experiences when he takes in food and water
It is wonderful to consider that in God's creation He ordained that human beings must exist by means of eating and drinking
When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He considered everything He encountered around Him as a sign of spiritual things
In God's eyes, everything that belongs to this life, everything that is temporary and visible, is not real, because it does not last forever
When we are hungry or thirsty, we should remember that we have another need in our deepest part, and this need is our real need
Rather, in effect, He was saying, 'I have presented Myself to you as the tree of life, with the fruits of life hanging from its boughs
When electricity operates in a bulb, it is light; when it operates in an amplifier, it is sound; and when it operates in a fan, it is wind
Both the evil things we did and the good things we want to do are related to the same tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
If all these things are related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and do not have anything to do with God, what should we do?
We cannot breathe out without breathing in, and once we breathe in, God comes in, and His element increases within us
Do we think that the God whose appearance is like the shining of gold and precious stones craves worship of earthy creatures?
In effect, God was indicating that there was no need to serve and worship Him, but rather to be fed and satisfied with Him
We need to eat and drink Him and allow His nature to enter into us in order for us to experience transformation
When we break the bread, we need to realize that we are not worshipping or serving Him; rather, we are eating and drinking Him
A man without God can become a man full of God, and the human element can be transformed by participating in God's element
If the Bible speaks of zeal, it is a zeal that comes from the fire that burns within us through our breathing of the fiery God
The Bible explicitly points out that this refers to the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him would receive
When such a Spirit enters man, He becomes rivers of living water in man to satisfy his thirst and to flow out of him
Before He died He established the Lords supper in which He took bread and blessed it and said to His disciples Take eat this is My body
When He came to the disciples on the evening of His resurrection, He breathed into them and in a sense said, 'Receive the holy breath'
The Bible begins with the tree of life and a flowing river, and it concludes with the tree of life and the river of water of life
In the beginning God reveals Himself to man as food for eating and drinking, and in the end He presents this same picture
When we first hear the expressions eating God and drinking God, we may consider them as hard sayings that are difficult to understand
As the living Father abides in Him, and He lives because of the Father, in the same way those who eat Him will live because of Him
Rather, everyone has the concept that following his baptism he should make a resolution to refrain from certain things
That is, after a person is saved, he needs the Lord to hold him by his right hand in order to progress in his spiritual journey
As the edible and drinkable One, the Lord Jesus would say to the man in the miry ditch, 'Poor man, are you hungry?
He only needs to take a drink of the Lord Jesus in the morning, and the Lord will live, move, and operate within him
We often say that we trust in the Lord, but the New Testament never speaks of trusting in the Lord Jesus in an outward way
When the word trust is used in the Chinese Union Version, it is often an inaccurate rendering of the original language
The Chinese Union Version translates this as, 'I am able to do all things by trusting in the One who empowers me'
It is not we who are able to do all things, but it is He who is doing all things through mingling Himself with us
It was the flesh of the lamb they ate that became their inward supply and strength and sustained them when they were thrust out of Egypt
God did not say Do this or do that rather He sent manna from heaven and daily fed them to the full so that they had the strength to continue
When they became thirsty, God did not tell them to do this or that; instead, He cleft a rock and out came water, which quenched their thirst
Prior to reaching Mount Sinai, God's deliverance of the children of Israel was altogether through eating and drinking
It was their ignorance of God and of themselves that forced God to give them the law that spoke of His requirements upon them
The Israelites did not obtain their strength from the blood; the blood could only expiate their sins before God
When He died on the cross for us, He not only made propitiation for our sins before God but also became food for us to eat
It is a pity that poor, degraded, and deformed Christianity does not know anything concerning this aspect of the Lord Jesus' death
God sent manna from heaven, and Moses, Aaron, and Miriam took it and were filled with it in order to continue with their journey
We are often like the Israelites, enjoying the Lord Jesus, eating and drinking Him, but we do not know that it is the Lord we are enjoying
The God who is the tree of life to man, who was unleavened bread, manna, and the living rock, became incarnated
No one who comes to a feast comes with the thought of working or doing something; instead, he goes with a mouth ready to eat
The meaning of being a son is to enjoy; a son enjoys all that his father has, but a hired servant works and has no share in the enjoyment
While the son proceeded with his clumsy speech, the father interrupted him and ordered the servants to put the best robe on him
If man had never fallen, there would never have been a question of shame, and there would never have been a need for clothing
When we have taken in the Son of God, when we have eaten the lamb and the fattened calf, there is genuine merriment within us
After speaking concerning eating Him in 6:57, the Lord said that anyone who thirsts should come to Him to drink in 7:37
Strictly speaking, if we have never been crazy in our experience as a Christian, our faith in Him is not very strong
Some Christians are sober before men and sober before God; they have never been crazy, because they have never been drunk with God
These verses say, 'As he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, You are insane, Paul
When we are full of the Spirit, we cannot help but be beside ourselves, because it seems as if we have been swept off our feet
They are like Peter who declared before the rulers, 'Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you judge'
Those who came to the Lord Jesus when He was on earth thought that He was a teacher, a rabbi, and that He came to teach men how to behave
The Lord went on to explain that it is the Spirit who enlivens, gives life, and that the flesh profits nothing
When He said to eat His flesh and drink His blood, He was not referring to His visible flesh, because His visible flesh cannot give life
His death on the cross dealt with these six things: sins, sin, our flesh, which is the old creation, Satan, the world, and death
In His third step, He came out of death in resurrection, fully overcoming and transcending the realm of death to enter into God
He walked out of the realm of death and entered the realm of resurrection and ascension, bringing His humanity with Him into God
Within the Spirit is the Father, the Son, incarnation, union with man, human living, crucifixion, and the termination of sins and sin itself
The termination of sins, the solution to sin and the problems of the flesh, Satan, the world, and death are also in Him
Everything of the Father is included in this Spirit, and all the experiences and attainments of the Son are also included in this Spirit
When a sentence comes to their mind, they utter it, and they also utter the next sentence that comes to their mind
When their minds are distracted by other things, they even spontaneously pray concerning these distracting matters
We generally utter groaning prayers when we are in a difficult situation, because the situation exhausts our mental capacity
When the suffering is intense, our mind is unable to control the situation, and the spirit is released through groaning before the Lord
The more we are in the spirit, the more we will touch God, and the more we will absorb Him, eat Him, and drink of Him
If we learn to assimilate God in our spirit, we will experience Him as everything, and He will be whatever we need
In a traditional wedding a pastor, based on the Scriptures, asks the husband to love his wife and the wife to submit to her husband
In the same way if the wife breathes in God, the Triune God, the Father who is in the Son and the Son who is the Spirit, enters into her
Whenever we are about to lose our temper, we should take a deep breath of God, and the temper will surely disappear
Our contact with man requires that we be sincere and truthful, but our contact with God requires that we turn to our spirit
Since our God is Spirit, and He is in our spirit, we can contact Him only with our spirit when we turn to our spirit
In summary, because God, who is Spirit, has entered into our spirit, we need to turn to our spirit and contact Him with our spirit
Whether or not a person can touch God depends altogether on learning the lesson of turning to our spirit and touching God with our spirit
Learning the lesson of turning to our spirit is a secret that enables us to touch God, making it easy for us to absorb and enjoy God
If the God who dwells in unapproachable light manifested Himself to us in His majesty, glory, and unapproachable holiness, what would we do?
When the apostle John who had reclined on the Lord Jesus breast saw the Lords glory on the island of Patmos he fell at His feet as if dead
We should thank the Lord that He presented Himself to man as food in the form of the tree of life with the fruit of life when He created man
Because God presented Himself to man in the form of food, Adam had no reason to be afraid when he saw the tree of life
The Lord's answer indicated that He was a piece of bread, because He said that the children's bread should not be given to the dogs
They despised the bread and pushed it around until it reached the edge of the table, and eventually off the table
He was no longer in Jerusalem, because He had been chased away by those in Jerusalem and was now in the Gentile land
When He descended from heaven to earth, He had no attractive form or beautiful appearance, much less any outward majesty
Although He appears to man as bread for food, the Bible says that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily
The fullness of the God of glory and of majesty who is most holy and transcendent and who is in unapproachable light dwelt in the man Jesus
Before He spoke such a word He prepared a supper in which He broke bread with the disciples and He said to them Take eat this is My body
When the children of Israel killed the passover lamb, they did not merely shed the blood of the lamb for their redemption
In the same way, when the Lord Jesus went to the cross, His death was not merely for redemption through the shedding of His blood
When He comes in a strong way, He can be compared to wind, and when He comes to us in a gentle way, He can be compared to breath
When we can hear or feel the movement of air, it is wind, but when we cannot hear or feel its movement, it is breath
We are convicted; we feel judged and condemn ourselves because the Spirit is the lamps of fire burning before the throne of God
In Revelation 1:14 the eyes of the Lamb, who is the Son of Man, are like a flame of fire that shines, exposes, and judges
When the Spirit touches man, He shines the light of God's throne into man, and man sees his unrighteousness and corruption
Everyone who has experienced this knows that when he touches the Spirit, he is connected to God and is transparent before God
In the light we see our sins, we are aware of our mistakes, we are convicted of our evil and corruption, and we condemn and judge ourselves
The more we condemn and judge ourselves, the happier we are inwardly, and the more we enjoy the Spirit's presence and God's infilling
When the Spirit shines within us, exposing our condition, we should condemn ourselves and confess our sins, breathing them out
A person who has never breathed out in this way has never breathed in God; he has never been saturated with God
We cannot help but breathe out and breathe in when the Spirit, as the lamps and the eyes of the Lamb, judges and condemns us
In this breathing out and breathing in, we find comfort, joy, peace, power, light, wisdom, healing, and utterance
Whether we are up to the proper standard as a Christian depends on whether we are right in the matter of eating, drinking, and enjoying God
If we have a problem with receiving God and are even a little off, we are not up to God's standard as a Christian
If we are proper in absorbing God, all our problems will be solved, and we will be proper Christians who match God's standard
Although we can join hands, embrace each other, or even be bound together by chains, we still cannot be fully united
Others may think that to say that man can draw near to God through the blood of Jesus Christ is an affront to God's holiness
A brother once noted that because some people eat too much beef or mutton, they have a strong smell of cow or sheep
He has not become a cow, but others will sense that he smells like a cow because the cow he has digested has become him
In the same way, when we eat and drink God, He is digested and transformed within us to become our constitution
If we do not eat, or if we do not eat enough, we will be short of an inward nourishment and supply, and we will not be able to survive
We can live, move, and work because we have eaten Him and have received Him into us as our nourishment and supply
The Lord Jesus, however, is the true bread which came down out of heaven; He is much higher than physical food
When He is digested into us to become our constitution, nourishment, and supply, He becomes our life, and we can live because of Him
In the same way, we Christians need Christ's life because every move of a Christian depends on the life of Christ
Just as a fish can never fly in the air and live the life of a bird, our natural life is completely useless in the kingdom of God
Wonderfully, while we are breathing out our sorrow, we touch the Lord, and the feeling of oppression in our spirit is lifted
Such words of exhortation may 'clip their wings,' and they are no longer able to fly though they were once transcendent
Their buoyancy, praises, and Christian countenance disappear; instead, they become heavily laden and deeply troubled
They may consider what to do in such 'dire' conditions and worry that since they have been encouraged, they must now trust the Lord
Similarly, we are Christians when we are connected to Christ, enjoy Him, and allow Him to live in us and be expressed through us
Because Christ is filling us and shining out through us, we will be a genuine Christian and not merely look like a Christian
We should not say that since we are saved, baptized, receive answers to prayers, and understand the Bible, we are, therefore, a Christian
When a believer is in this condition, he is a Christian only in name; he cannot be called a Christian in reality
At the time of our salvation we could not describe this in a clear way but in retrospect we can testify that this was truly our experience
We may listen to a message on living a proper Christian life by walking in a manner that is worthy of our calling
We see no relationship between the message and our Christian life; hence, the word that is spoken is unable to penetrate our being
When others touch us, they sense that instead of sourness and bitterness, our whole being is full of gentleness and sweetness
Before praying, we were happy and innocent, living spontaneously in the spirit, but our prayer has driven us out of our spirit
Formerly we were blissfully ignorant; now we are clear that we are evil, unreliable, and able to lose our temper
Those who are clear in their mind have been eating too much of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
We did not know the meaning of losing or controlling our temper, and we were not concerned or afraid of our temper
Once we are inwardly cut off from Christ, we lose our enjoyment of Christ and have no way to live the Christian life
We need to learn not to stray away from our spirit and not to be concerned about our thoughts and so many other things
We need to be a simple Christian and focus only on the fact that Christ is our life and that He is dwelling in us
Requests made in this way are surely granted, and we bear much fruit because His fullness is expressed and manifested through us
God operates in us, and the exceedingly great power accomplishes everything for us, even above all that we ask or think
Spending an hour a day to absorb God is of more value than occupying ourselves with other things for a thousand hours
Our problem is that we hear many exhortations concerning breathing in God, but we spend only a few minutes breathing
No matter how busy we are, we should daily devote some time for prayer with the sole purpose of breathing in God
The secret to his being filled with God was in his setting aside three definite times a day to absorb God and to enjoy Him
In the same chapter Peter was praying in the sixth hour, which is at noon: 'Peter went up on the housetop to pray around the sixth hour'
Peter probably prayed every day at noon, and Cornelius probably prayed every day at about three in the afternoon
Both the Old Testament and the New Testament show that those who truly receive God and enjoy Him have set times for prayer
Because it is too early for them to be occupied with lunch preparation, they spend some time to quietly breathe in God
We should never use the time before we go to bed for prayer, because when we are exhausted, we may fall asleep while praying
If we mean business and set aside a period of time to contact God every day, we will receive many unexpected blessings
We will see visions, we will know ourselves, and God will unveil mysteries concerning His Word and grant us understanding
We will receive a special portion of grace as a special kind of enlightenment or as a rebuke, cleansing, or dealing
If we take away this time, we will be deprived of opportunities to receive grace and of opportunities for God to work in us
Whether the saints are old or young, brothers or sisters, we will all suffer a great loss if we do not spend some time before the Lord
It is good to be silent at the beginning of our prayer, and it is also good to have a period of silence during our prayer
Because our words of prayer can distract us from the spirit, there is the need of a halt to bring our entire person back to the spirit
Everything that God wants to do to man and every grace that He intends to bestow on man can be fulfilled only after man prays
If Abraham had not walked a distance with God that day, but had instead promptly parted with God, God would not have had a way to save Lot
He intended to judge and destroy Sodom, but His child Lot was still in the city of Sodom and needed to be rescued
In visiting Abraham, He settled the business He had with Abraham and was waiting for Abraham to do something for Him
If there is an echo within when we touch a certain matter, we have touched God in that matter and can proceed to pray for that matter
If God's presence is not there, and there is no sense of God when we touch a certain matter, we should drop that matter
No matter how many burdens we have or how many difficulties we face, we should never pray according to these difficulties
The main result is that when one prays this way, even in the process of his prayer, he receives God and enjoys God
We should not be afraid that this will take too much time, and we should not worry that this will delay our affairs
In order for us to absorb God, eat and drink Him, and enjoy Him continually, we need to pray and read the Word every day
Concerning breathing in God through prayer, we have pointed out that God dwells in our spirit through His Spirit
Breathing out and breathing in deliver us from everything related to us and fill us with everything related to God
The Bible we have in our hands is the same, but it seems as if we read different Bibles because we receive different things
A brother with a deep knowledge of God and the Scriptures once said that the kind of person we are determines the kind of Bible we have
He admitted that he joined Christianity because the Christian Bible provides the clearest teaching on filial piety
Do we want a book on literature, science, arguments, filial piety, love for husbands, submission for wives, honesty, or lies?
Since we desire to be persons who eat, drink, absorb, and breathe in God, we need a drastic change in our concept concerning the Bible
We read the Bible with the purpose of eating, drinking, absorbing, and breathing in God, because we know that the Bible is the Word of God
Since God wants to be our food, His expression and manifestation to man as the Word means that the Word is man's food
Those who have experienced this can testify that when we read the Bible with a heart to absorb God, it becomes food to us
Even a commandment such as husbands loving their wives can become food to us when we receive it in the way of absorbing God
The more we honor our parents the more we will be filled and satisfied and the more we will eat and drink God and be saturated with His life
When the Jews celebrate the Passover, they slaughter a lamb, shed its blood for the remission of their sins, and eat the meat of the lamb
When the lamb was killed, its blood was shed for the remission of sins, and its flesh was eaten for the satisfaction of man
Since the Jews understood the type, they should have also understood that the Lord was the Lamb prepared by God for them
His shed blood redeemed man from his sins, and His broken body released His life to enter into man for man's satisfaction
His desire is to enter into man's spirit as Spirit, to be man's food and man's life, and to cause man to live by Him
Man does not live by bread alone, because he is not composed of only a body; within man there is also a spirit
The Lord says that man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God
We must have a change in concept to see that the Bible is not a book of God's teaching or truth; it is God's food for us
If our view changes, and we consider the Bible to be God's expression and His breathing out, the Bible will be a different book to us
When we come to the Bible, we must eat and drink God as our food; we must breathe in God Himself and enjoy Him
Many brothers and sisters often read the Bible but seldom touch God, because they are not persons who seek after God
They are students of the Bible, seekers of truths, who want to find out the logic, commandments, and precepts of God
A 'chicken' has been placed before us, but we insist on picking the 'bones' and studying them even though they have no nutritional value
Although this may seem peculiar, many people read their Bible in this way and therefore do not derive any benefit
We are now clear that reading the Word is not for studying, in the same way that eating chicken is not the same as studying the chicken
In conclusion, God is Spirit for us to breathe Him in through prayer, and God is the Word for us to eat Him through reading the word
Praying without reading is the same as walking with one foot, and reading without praying is also the same as walking with one foot
Similarly, it is not only difficult but also unnecessary to decide whether we should pray or read first when we enjoy God
There is no need to explain to the brothers and sisters what to do first and what to do next when they absorb God
In Psalm 119:147-148, when the psalmist rose in the morning, he first cried out and then mused on the Lord's word
In John 15:7 the Lord said, 'If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you'
He is the Word, and He became the Spirit so that we can contact Him, absorb Him, eat Him, drink Him, and enjoy Him
Having the Spirit without the Word may lead to error, and having the Bible without the Spirit may lead to death
In this way, reading and praying are mingled to the extent that our reading is praying and our praying is reading
It is preferable for the visible Bible to be a pocket-size version so that we can take it with us and read it wherever we may be
When we are ready to enjoy God through prayer, we should be calm, call our entire being back to our spirit, and touch the Lord
We should read the verses again, not merely with our mind but by absorbing the riches in the Word with our spirit
If we merely read the Bible, it will remain in our mind and be dead letters to us; we will not touch, eat, or drink God
We may also testify concerning how the Lord has opened our eyes to see that those who are in Him are no longer condemned
We simply need to change our way of reading from the former approach of studying with our mind to eating and absorbing with our spirit
When we meditate in this way, there will be much prayer and intercession; we will receive burdens, guidance, and commissions from the Lord
When the word that we read touches our inward being, it becomes a burden within us and directs us in our prayer
In this prayer, two prayers are combined into one; God prays in our praying, and our prayer matches His prayer
Since He is the motive and source of this prayer and He is flowing through us, we can ask whatever we will, and it will be done
In such a living we have resurrection, the Spirit, the church, the Body of Christ, and coordination in service
When we realize that God's relationship with man is based on His being food to man, our reading of the Bible will be greatly affected
Many people do not know how to read the Bible because they do not have a proper understanding of this basic concept
May every child of God clearly see this matter so that he can boldly say, 'I read the Bible in order to eat God
The Lord Jesus said that man shall not live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God
Rather, it means that we should touch this book with the deepest part of our being and not merely understand or ponder over it with our mind
If we touch the words of the Bible with our spirit, and not merely read it with our eyes, we will contact the Word with our spirit
It is true that we need to exercise our eyes and our ears, but we will neither see nor hear without the exercise of our heart
In the same way, when we read the Bible, it is possible for us to 'look without seeing, listen without hearing, and eat without tasting'
When we are reading Genesis, our mind may wander to Revelation, and when we are reading Revelation, our mind may return to Genesis
After reading he thinks that he has obtained something, but what he has received is in his mind, not in his spirit
They may not know how to restrict their mind and exercise their spirit, allowing it to take the lead when they read the Bible
Because he does not realize the weakness of the mind, he is unconsciously distracted even though he had a good beginning
He should immediately exercise his spirit to pray, saying, 'Lord, You give life to the dead, and You call the things not being as being
When he prays in this way, he is contacting God with his spirit rather than considering doctrines with his mind
Rather, we should exercise our spirit, and turn the word that has touched us into prayer so that we can breathe in God
In such a prayer we are not exercising our mind; rather, we are taking the Word as food and eating it with our spirit
In another situation the Holy Spirit may point out that instead of being dead and nothing, we are alive and full of many things
If we do not practice this, we will not eat much God when we read the Bible; we will not receive much genuine supply in our spirit
We must exercise to be limited by our spirit, and we must exercise our spirit to breathe in God by means of the Word
Whether or not we understand a passage, we should not spend time to consider it; rather, we should restrict our mind
No matter which chapter and which verse we read, we can find rich food and be filled because the Bible is full of nutrition
In the same way, when we come to the Bible, we should not come with a heart to study doctrine or to investigate some truth
We all have a pair of colored glasses within us that prevents us from knowing the true color and meaning of the Bible
If we wear green glasses and look at a white book, the book will appear to be green, and we will not see the true color of the book
The type of person we are determines the type of glasses we have, and our glasses determine the type of Bible we read
In coming to the Bible, we need to remove the glasses of our concepts before we can see the true color and meaning of the Scriptures
We must take off our inner glasses; we must break them before we can see the true color and meaning of the Bible
Daily he was bothered by the thought that an elder, who should be compassionate toward others, could offend a person in such a way
The husband said that he read Ephesians 5 that morning and found the good teaching of wives submitting to their husbands
The wife said that she too had read Ephesians 5 that morning and had found an even higher teaching than the one her husband had found
The husband found that the wife should submit to the husband, and the wife found that the husband should love the wife
A man from Zheqiang must remove his Zheqiang glasses, and a man from Shantung must remove his Shantung glasses
He spoke about not being hasty in doing anything with God, because nothing hasty, quick, or hurried is from God
He said that the Bible does not give us one instance of God running, because He is a God who is never in haste, who is never quick
We may think that these are silly stories, but they show that the kind of person we are determines the kind of Bible we read
One day he said that in the Bible when God appears, smoke goes up from His nostrils, and His voice is like thunder
A mild person has a 'mild' Bible, an angry person, an 'angry' Bible, a rough person, a 'rough' Bible, and a fine person, a 'fine' Bible
In other words, if the Lord was the Christ, He should deliver John from prison, and if He was not, John should wait for someone else
We do not need to have any concepts, we do not need to have the intention of learning something, and we do not need to seek for inspiration
When we come to the word, we must be very simple, having the attitude of not wanting anything and not knowing anything
We may wonder how a reading that does not pay attention to spiritual inspiration can help us understand the Bible
While the light of the Bible will shine brightly before us, we will also feel that no one can fully understand this book
As we eat God's Word and absorb God, we will enter into the experience of enjoying God through reading His Word
He should not read the Lord's Word with his own ideas, nor should he seek to learn some teachings from the Bible
These concepts can be compared to colored glasses that frustrate us from seeing the original color and light in the Bible
Some may think that it is not possible to come to the Word without any concepts, but this principle applies to many spiritual things
A student of the Word should not be void of all concepts, but his concepts must be dealt with and broken by the Lord
He can be full of endeavors, thoughts, and concepts, but every time he comes to the Bible, he must set his concepts aside and drop them
These concepts are a veil and limitation, blocking and limiting them from seeing the central and crucial matters in the Word
We are like tissue paper in relation to some things in the Bible; we absorb them as soon as they come to our attention
We are like oily paper however in relation to other crucial and central matters we repel them and turn away from them whenever we read them
In the previous chapter, the young man who was offended by the elders had the concept that elders should not offend young believers
Whenever God's Word touches us, there should be a corresponding condition in our being that matches His touching
If our condition does not match the Word, it will not affect us, but if our inward condition matches the Word, it will affect us
If a husband expects his wife to always submit to him, he will respond to passages on wives submitting to their husbands
If a man pursues humility, considering it to be the most necessary virtue, he will respond only to teachings on humility in his reading
Since he is filled with this concept, it is not easy for him to receive any light or to be touched by any other portion in the Bible
When he reads teachings on denying the self, bearing the cross, and following the Lord, he is immediately struck with these words
His inward being is filled with the matter of denying the self, and this is the only portion he finds in his Bible
From the beginning of the year to the end of the year you read the divinely inspired Bible which is veiled by your concepts
Even though he can still find superficial things, he has no way to find the basic and central items of the Bible
There may be many other items in the Bible, but the basic, foundational, and central thought is that God desires to be life to man
If we read the Bible with this unique concept, we will have the proper concept and we will find the crucial items in the Bible
Although these words are in the Bible, trusting God, taking refuge in Him, and trusting in His Word are common expressions among Christians
We must not only read the Word with our spirit in a calm way, but we must also learn to set our concepts aside
Preconceived concepts within man are a strong veil, preventing him from seeing the true meaning and color of the Bible
At any rate, by that time you will no longer be saying, 'To my observation,' but you will not find the true meaning of the Bible until then'
If we drop our concepts and come to the Bible for its original meaning and color, we will see the central and crucial things
The Bible may be full of weighty words, but they will not touch us, because there will not be an echo or a response within us
What is the central matter, the root and trunk, of the Bible, and what are the peripheral matters, the branches and the leaves?
Whereas God is trying to work His Son into my friend to be his life, my friend does not understand or even care for this
They might not be clear concerning who the Lord Jesus is, but by calling on Him, they can still be saved by God's mercy
As long as he is only concerned about his troubles, those who try to help him can only help him solve his troubles
Many people begin their Christian lives by asking Him to do many things for them and thank and praise Him when their prayers are answered
They become angry and stop going to meetings or praying at home, thinking that God is not faithful and not trustworthy
Since man does not know God, he thinks that God is a goodhearted and good-natured God, who blindly dispenses love and mercy
Some preachers even say that man suffers because he lacks religion and that only religion can solve the problems of human suffering
Although the Bible does mention many such precious promises, these things are not the central goal in God's heart
Because we have sufferings, sicknesses, and needs, He comforts, heals, and abides by the promises in the Bible
In the same way, when God wants to make us His vessel, to enter into us as life, He must first cleanse our vessel from sin and evil
When he reads the Bible and finds something on morality, he heartily responds to what he reads, and he echoes it
Most people mark only the passages in their Bibles on love for one another, meekness, humility, righteousness, and justice
If we can find only these matters in the Bible then the Bible is no different from the writings of other religions or the teachings of sages
Although the Bible contains these four peripheral categories of things, the central matter of the Bible concerns God becoming our life
As he continues reading, he is not touched by verse 5 but is touched by the words in verse 6, which say, 'In nothing be anxious'
He reads, 'But in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God'
He has exercised his spirit, not his mind, and has digested the word through prayer, eating God through the Word
Verse 7 says, 'The peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus'
God says that we should take account of things that are true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of
We should think of good things, not evil things, pure things, not filthy things, and lovely things, not hateful things
Because our brother's mind is full of ethical concepts, he responds immediately to these words on morality and ethics
He reads, 'I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me' , and he exclaims, 'I have found the secret to human living!
The prayer enables him to touch his spirit, and the more he touches his spirit, the more he is filled and satisfied
Even though these are central verses, his inward being is like oily paper that prevents the ink from penetrating into his heart
On the third day the brother reads chapter 2 of Galatians and does not see anything significant in verses 1 through 10
When we are satisfied, He becomes our inner wisdom and our secret to human living; we will spontaneously live out His virtues
Others may have been touched by the words, 'Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation'
Still others may be led to confession by the words, 'Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is'
Some brothers may be touched by verse 25 to love their wives and care for them because they are the weaker vessels
A brother who has not been meeting for half a year may repent and be recovered to the meetings after reading Hebrews 10:25
These saints may then testify concerning what they have read in the meetings and the meetings will be living and full of the Lords presence
If we stand only with our needs, feelings, and psychological cravings, we can receive only the superficial things from the Bible
We should still learn to read with our spirit, to deny our own thoughts, and to turn all the words that touch us into prayer
If we want genuine, spiritual prayers, prayers that reach God, touch God, breathe in God, and are in God, we must pray in the Holy Spirit
These two spirits, the Spirit of God and our spirit, need to fellowship with one another, live with one another, and be mingled together
These examples help us to understand what it means for God's Spirit to be in our spirit and for our spirit to be in His Spirit
Once we understand the story of mutual fellowship between these two spirits, we can understand what it means to be in the Holy Spirit
Although we cannot see the Spirit of God with our eyes or feel Him with our hands, we can clearly sense Him when He touches us within
On the evening of His resurrection the Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Although we can neither see nor touch air, we know that it has entered us because we feel inwardly relieved, refreshed, and comforted
When we follow the Spirit to pray in this way, we are praying in our spirit, and we are praying in the Holy Spirit
Because we are praying apart from the Spirit, our prayer seems to hit only the air; it is not solid, and it does not touch God
The more we pray in this way, the more we are inwardly enlightened, comforted, satisfied, nourished, joyful, and anointed
There should be an Amen within him, witnessing that the more he prays, the more he touches God and is filled with God
If we have all had this experience, we know the difference between these two conditions and consequences of prayer
Some brothers and sisters may be clear concerning praying in the Holy Spirit, but they might not know how to enter the Spirit
Rather, a person who can control himself even while he is losing his temper tends to find it easy to turn to his spirit to pray
It is, therefore, difficult for them to absorb and enjoy God, not to mention the fact that they have many unanswered prayers
It is profitable for a person to devote some time every day to calm his thoughts and turn his entire being to God in order to contact Him
If we are able to restrict ourselves and turn to the Spirit in this way, we should not immediately open our mouths to pray
As soon as we are free from our thoughts and turn from the outward things to our spirit, we touch God immediately
As soon as we touch God in our spirit, we feel solid within; we feel that we have the anointing and the moving of the Holy Spirit
Sometimes they do not even need to close their eyes; they can turn to their spirit even while others are talking beside them
He could calmly pray to touch the Lord, sense His presence, and be brought into the Holy Spirit, no matter how loudly they shouted
They cannot even be calm when they are alone, not to mention being calm when others argue and fight in their presence
Maturity does not depend on the number of years one has been a Christian, and it does not depend on the amount of teaching a person knows
For this reason, we must continue to exercise until we can stop ourselves and turn to our spirit when we are ready to pray
We will behold God, we will see God; our spirit will contact God, and we will be able to offer genuine prayers
We should pray in this way, not only in the morning when we contact God but also in our time of prayer during the day
Such prayers are the issue of the Spirit of God being mingled with man's spirit and of man's spirit being mingled with the Spirit of God
When a man exercises his spirit to pray he is praying with his spirit in Gods Spirit or we can say that Gods Spirit is praying in his spirit
Since prayer is an expression of the union of God and man, no true prayer can be uttered without God's initiation
Please remember that everyone who opens his mouth quickly speaks invariably from himself and from his own initiation
Another feeling may lead us to pray for a brother in difficulty or to pray for the message meeting on the Lord's Day
Sometimes we may have a feeling not to pray for anything, or even to praise or thank Him, but simply to bow down before Him and worship Him
If we restrict ourselves in this way, we will be in our mind, and we will be the initiator and motivator of our prayer
The primary matter is that we pray by following the sense in our spirit; we allow God to pass through us and to mingle Himself with us
They only know that they prayed for twenty minutes in the morning, and that they had the savor of heaven while they prayed
They muster their will, exercise their mind, act according to their memory, and try to repeat their prayer from the previous day
When they tried to consciously repeat the experience, they fall into a formality and are no longer in their spirit
We should now understand that the governing principle to touching God is to follow the sense in our spirit when we pray
Those who are experienced in prayer know that there are many things to consider related to the sense of the spirit
If the sense in our spirit is for us to pray rapidly, we should pray accordingly; otherwise, we may lose the Spirit
Sometimes the sense in our spirit may be to pray slowly requiring us to utter the words one by one otherwise we may lose the Lords presence
There are also times when the inner feeling does not allow us to stop, even if we have other matters to take care of
Even if the greatest enterprise in the world is about to fall upon us, we should not pray for it without the leading of the inward feeling
When we enjoy God through reading the Word, we need to drop our views and concepts in order to receive the central matters in God's Word
We must learn to set aside our feelings, opinions, ideas, memory, and decisions and pray solely according to the feeling in our spirit
We may utter a sentence, and the Lord will give us more feelings, which will lead us to utter another sentence
Even praying with the words of the Bible can be a frustration if it is not according to the sense in our spirit
Many know what it means to wait on God and muse upon Him, but few have truly learned to wait on God and muse on Him
May we all practice not only to enjoy God through reading the Word and prayer but also to intercede, behold, wait, and muse in our prayers
When this is a persons condition the Lord will surely be pleased to open His heart to him and it will be easy for him to know the Lords will
Although God did not mention Lot by name, the fact that He spoke of the place where Lot was gave Abraham a hint of God's heart
In order for God to work on earth, He had to find someone who would echo His heart, who would be concerned for what was on His heart
In Ephesians 6:18-19 Paul says that we should petition concerning all the saints and, in particular, to petition for him the apostle
Such persons can intercede and will intercede because God's Spirit is moving in their spirit and stirring them up to pray for God's concerns
Those who intercede for the church, the saints, and God's workers can do so because they live in their spirit and touch God
He will become drier and emptier as he prays, and he will not have the assurance that his prayers will be answered
A brother once said that he had been praying for a long time according to the Lord's promise in John 15:7 of giving us whatever we ask
His prayer to graduate from the university, marry a college graduate, and have a wonderful family had not been answered
To stand in the breach is to be one who touches God's heart, lives in God, cares for God's desire, and prays accordingly
As a result, their prayers, whether they are for themselves, for others, for the church, or for the work, are all outside of God
If we want to learn the work of intercession we must learn to turn to our spirit enter into God drop our concepts and care for Gods heart
Most people understand beholding the Lord to mean looking up at a God who sits far above in the heavens and who sends His light down to men
If we do not turn to God or do not fix our gaze on Him but instead hastily utter a few words, it will be difficult for us to enjoy God
As a spiritual fact God never leaves us, but in our experience we may sense that He is far away or that He is near us
We would not consider two hours to be too long to converse with a close friend, but we would consider two hours to be a long time to wait
If He does not seem to be near us after we turn to our spirit, and there are no feelings within, we should not initiate anything
