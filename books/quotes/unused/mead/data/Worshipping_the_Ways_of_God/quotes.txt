[1]  And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth; I being in the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren" Gen 24:26-27 .
[2]  We must worship God, but please remember that a day will come when God opens our eyes to know Him as more than just our Father; we will know Him also as our God.
[3]  As we have already pointed out, when a person receives a revelation concerning God and he sees that He is God and that man is man, he only can bow down and worship.
[4]  Our heart must be brought by God to the point of bowing down before Him and saying, "I see that I should not only worship You, but also what You have and what pleases You.
[5]  But let me repeat that all true worship comes from knowing God and receiving a revelation of God.
[6]  If we want to learn to walk before God, we will have no future unless we can learn to worship the ways of God not just to worship God.
[7]  Thus, all who know God must be brought to the point of saying, "I worship the ways of God.
[8]  The ways of God are what God wants to do in us.
[9]  This kind of person can never give glory to God because He does not worship God.
[10]  We have said before and we will say again that if we really want to worship God, we will find again and again that He gives us many opportunities to worship Him.
[11]  Our second illustration is found in Exodus 4, when God sent Moses to tell the children of Israel that He had visited them and would deliver them out of the bondage of Egypt.
[12]  When our way is well-prospered, we cannot but worship God.
[13]  Perhaps the children of Israel said, "We have been slaves for so many years, God does not care," just as we may say, "I have been sick for so long, God would not heal me.
[14]  We will tell God that everything we went through was for our benefit; we will bow our head to say, "God, I worship You."
[15]  God not only gives grace to us, but the ways in which He gives grace and chooses us cause us to worship God.
[16]  God gave him two tablets of stone with the Ten Commandments written on them.
[17]  This provoked God to great displeasure and He said to Moses: "Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
[18]  When God had proclaimed the awe of His majesty, "Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped" v. 8 . Please bear in mind that knowing God is not merely a matter of grace.
[19]  If we know God's ways by knowing Him as our Captain, God will handle everything, and we will worship Him.
[20]  He did not just worship God for His power; he also worshipped for the way in which God would defeat the Midianites, for His choosing, and for the way in which He was pleased to fight the Midianites.
[21]  This does not mean that the work of God is not important, but this does mean that worshipping God is to glorify God.
[22]  The strange thing is that when others would have rebelled, David did not rebel.
[23]  When others would have been disappointed, David was not disappointed.
[24]  Those who know and love God, those who have a revelation of Him and have seen His appearing, will bow before God and say, "If my suffering vindicates Your holiness, then I say, Amen.'
[25]  Finally, we need to see that God sometimes refuses prayer because He wants to break us, like breaking David, or wants to vindicate Himself and His holiness.
[26]  May God grant us grace from this day forth to offer Him not only the worship that is borne out of revelation but also the worship that expresses itself in submission and consecration.
