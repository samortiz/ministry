   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BREAKING OF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 The relationship of life between the believers and God being eternally unbreakable They shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My Father s hand John 10:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The relationship of life between the believers and God will never be broken, because they have received the eternal life from God, which causes them never to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, since God s hand is mighty, nothing can snatch them out of His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2 The fellowship of life between the believers and God being breakable But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word if in this verse indicates that the fellowship of life between us and God is breakable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we walk in God s light, we will live in the fellowship of God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, since we often fail to live in God s light, often disobeying and sinning, we often lose the fellowship of God s life, thus causing it to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE RESTORATION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1 By the confession of sins If we confess our sins, He God is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank God that although our fellowship of life with Him can be broken, it can also be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are willing to confess our sins to God according to His shining, He will forgive us and cleanse us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is according to His faithfulness based on His word and according to His righteousness because of the Lord s blood in order that our fellowship of life with Him may be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE NEEDING TO BE MAINTAINED BY THE SENSE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1 The Lord s life in us not only has its fellowship but also has its sense.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This sense of life is for the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fellowship of life is maintained in the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever we neglect the sense of life, the fellowship of life is broken and lost, and the sense of life thus becomes dull.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 If we will once again care for and obey this dull sense of life, the fellowship of life will be restored, even deepened, and the sense of life will also be keener.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two the sense of life and the fellowship of life reciprocally affect each other in a continuous cycle, causing the believers to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>X. THE DANGER TO A BELIEVER NOT LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1 Losing the supply and function of life and suffering loss Every branch in Me the Lord that does not bear fruit, He God takes it away John 15:2 ; If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned John 15:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a saved person, who is a branch of the Lord, the vine, does not bear fruit, he will be taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reason for his fruitlessness is that he does not abide in the Lord, in the fellowship of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, he is taken away, cast out, dried up, gathered, and cast into the fire to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not abide in the Lord and live in the fellowship of life, we will run a great risk of being cut off from the Lord and of losing our supply and function, thus suffering loss.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, this is not to perish but to suffer loss, to be punished 1 Cor 3:15 , because here the Lord is not speaking about the conditions of salvation but about the conditions of fruitbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2 Being fearful and put to shame Abide in Him the Lord , that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming 1 John 2:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we abide in the Lord and have fellowship with Him, we spontaneously walk before the Lord and live in His will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This will cause us to have boldness and not be put to shame at the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Otherwise, when we see Him, we will be in fear and will be put to shame, being separated from His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such danger should warn us to live in the fellowship of the Lord s life.</S>
