	 <h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO DEAL WITH THE WORD PROPERLY<br />
IN ORDER TO HAVE THE LORD&rsquo;S MANIFESTATION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we fellowshipped concerning the Lord&rsquo;s words in John 14:3: &ldquo;Where I am you also may be.&rdquo; Since the Lord is in God the Father, He is bringing us into God the Father. Not only so, since He is one with God and is mingled with God, He will cause us also to be one with God and mingled with God. It is rather easy for those who are one with God and are mingled with God to have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and to have His making an abode with them. What condition is necessary for us to have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and His making an abode with us? According to 14:21 and 23 two conditions must be met: one is that we love Him, and the other is that we keep His word.</p>
<p>The first half of verse 21 says, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me,&rdquo; and the first half of verse 23 says, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word.&rdquo; These verses show that in order to have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and His making an abode with us, we need to properly deal with the Lord&rsquo;s word. Hence, the burden of this chapter is a continuation of our previous fellowship, which is, if we desire to have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation regularly and to have His making an abode with us, we must deal with His word in a proper way. We must have a proper attitude toward and a good relationship with the word. Whether we can have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and His making an abode with us depends on how we deal with the word.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, there are several matters that should not be neglected when dealing with the Lord&rsquo;s word. If we neglect these matters, we will not properly deal with the word, and there will be a problem between the word and us. If there is a problem or if we do not deal with the word properly, we will not have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation, that is, His face, nor will the Lord make an abode with us. If we would have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation, the Lord&rsquo;s face, and have His making an abode with us, we must have a proper attitude when dealing with the word, and we must have a proper relationship with the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE WORD</h2>
<p>We must first pay attention to the wonderful relationship between the Holy Spirit and the word. Concerning this, we have already mentioned Ephesians 5:18-20 and Colossians 3:16-17. We compared these two portions and saw that while these two portions show the same result, they have different causes. The result is that those who are saved praise the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and they also give thanks at all times to God in the name of the Lord Jesus. In this respect these two portions are similar. They can be likened to twin sisters who have similar facial features but who, if you look at them closely, are actually different. These verses in Ephesians and Colossians are very similar in what they say, but there is still a difference. Ephesians says that when the believers are filled with the Holy Spirit in their spirit, they are able to praise and thank the Lord, whereas Colossians says that when the believers are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, they can praise and thank the Lord. This shows that the word cannot be separated from the Spirit; they are two aspects of one thing. A person who can praise and thank God must be one who is filled with the Spirit as well as with the word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word and the Spirit Being One</h2>
<p>Being filled with the word and being filled with the Spirit are not two different types of filling but two aspects of one filling. In other words, the word and the Spirit are actually one, not two. In order to be filled with the Spirit, one must be filled with the word, and in order to be filled with the word, one has to be filled with the Spirit. The word and the Spirit cannot be separated. We have a clear basis in the Bible for saying that the word is the Spirit. In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life;...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; It is not surprising that Paul says in Ephesians that we can praise and give thanks when we are filled with the Spirit, and in Colossians he says that we can praise and give thanks when we are filled with the word. He says this because the word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the word.</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Then John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; The Word is God, and God is Spirit. Let us now compare these two verses together with 6:63. John 1:1 says that the Word was God, 4:24 says that God is Spirit, and 6:63 says that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit. This is surely wonderful. In these verses we see God, the Word, and the Spirit. The Word is God, God is Spirit, and the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit. On the one hand, God is the Word, and on the other hand, God is the Spirit. Thus, the Word is also the Spirit. The three&mdash;God, the Word, and the Spirit&mdash;are one. Hence, when we touch the Word, we touch the Spirit. Moreover, when we touch the Word and the Spirit, we touch God because the Word is God, and the Spirit is also God.</p>
<p>If we would have a proper attitude toward the Lord and His word, we must see that the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God. God is Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Word. God&rsquo;s words are the words in the Bible, and these words cannot be separated from the Holy Spirit. We must have the Holy Spirit in us in order to have the Lord&rsquo;s word in us. Likewise, when we have the words of the Bible in us, we will have the Holy Spirit, because these two are one&mdash;they are God. The Word is the Spirit, God is the Word, and God is also the Spirit. Hence, the Word is God, the Spirit is also God, and the Word is the Spirit.</p>
<p>On the one hand, God is the Word, and on the other hand, God is the Spirit. Therefore, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. This may sound simple, but it is not so easy to explain this accurately. This is the relationship between the Word, the Spirit, and God: God is the Word, and God is also Spirit. Hence, the Word is the Spirit, because both are God. It is no wonder that when the apostle Paul was moved by the Holy Spirit to write Ephesians and Colossians, he uttered this light to cause the believers to see that they are full of praise and always give thanks because they are filled with the Holy Spirit and with the Lord&rsquo;s word. Indeed the word and the Spirit are actually one.</p>
