   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>UNTO AN INHERITANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Peter 1:4 says, Unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the end of verse 3 there is a comma, not a period.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then verse 4 begins with unto.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that unto an inheritance in verse 4 is in apposition to unto a living hope in verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the living hope is the inheritance and that the inheritance is the living hope.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A living hope, resulting from regeneration, is our expectation of the coming blessing; an inheritance is the fulfillment of our hope in the coming age and in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The inheritance in verse 4 comprises the coming salvation of our souls see verses 5 and 9 , the grace to be received at the unveiling of the Lord v. 13 , the glory to be revealed 5:1 , the unfading crown of glory 5:4 , and the eternal glory 5:10 . All these items of our eternal inheritance are related to the divine life which we received through regeneration and which we are experiencing and enjoying through our entire Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This inheritance is the full possession of that which was promised to Abraham and all believers Gen 12:3; see Gal 3:6 ff.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>, an inheritance, as much higher than that which fell to the children of Israel in the possession of Canaan, as the sonship of the regenerate, who have already received the promise of the Spirit through faith as a pledge of their inheritance, is higher than the sonship of Israel: compare Gal 3:18, 29; 1 Cor 6:9; Eph 5:5; Heb 9:15 Wiesinger, quoted by Alford .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At this point we need to ask an important question: Is this inheritance for us today, or is it only for the future?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I was young, I was taught that the inheritance in this verse refers to the eternal blessing, the blessing of eternity, which we shall enjoy in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was also taught that this inheritance is not for our enjoyment today, but is for us to enjoy in the future, after we die and go to our heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians have been taught in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Others may think that in 1:4 Peter is speaking about an everlasting inheritance in contrast to the temporal inheritance of physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of understanding is altogether natural; it is without light or revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This verse does say that the inheritance is being kept for us in the heavens, but it does not say that the inheritance is for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, as we read this verse, our natural mind may inject into it the thought of the future, even though this verse says nothing concerning the future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Often when we read the Bible we read things into it; we inject some element of our natural thought into God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is serious!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not regard the inheritance in 1:4 as only for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This inheritance is for us today, tomorrow, and for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the day we were regenerated this inheritance has been our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>An inheritance is a proper and legal possession.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not gained by our energy, ability, or deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, it is granted to us by another in a way that is legitimate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not work for an inheritance; we receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the day we were regenerated, we were given the right to share an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This inheritance includes all the blessings related to eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our first birth gave us an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we were born of our parents, we inherited God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because creation is our inheritance through birth, we can enjoy the air, the sunshine, and the rain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The money we pay for food actually goes to pay the cost of the labor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The food itself is given to us by God the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there were no sunshine, rain, or air, who could produce food?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Food is a gift from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By our first birth we have inherited the earth, the sunshine, the air, the atmosphere, the rain, and the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All these aspects of our earthly inheritance serve to keep us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without such an inheritance, no one could live.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the same principle, through our second birth, regeneration, we have been born into a new inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This inheritance is not on earth; rather, it is kept in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although the new inheritance is kept for us in the heavens, we can enjoy it now on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may use as an illustration the application of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although electricity is stored in the power plant far away, we apply it and enjoy it daily in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Electricity is transmitted from the power plant to our homes for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, our heavenly, divine, spiritual inheritance is kept in the heavens; yet it is continually being transmitted into our spirit for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do you not enjoy the riches of the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As reborn ones, we can daily experience a divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we call on the Lord Jesus, we may have the sense that something within us is connected to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before we were regenerated, we never had this kind of realization.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This transmission is the application and enjoyment of the inheritance kept in the heavens for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The strength of an electric current is measured in amperes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The greater the amperage, the stronger the current will be.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The principle is the same in our experience of the divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When I was saved, the amperage of the transmission into me was quite small.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But through the years, this heavenly amperage has increased so that now, especially when I minister, the amperage of the heavenly transmission is beyond my ability to measure.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to be impressed with the fact that the inheritance in 1:4 is for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not only for us to enjoy in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once a man has been born on earth, he has the right to enjoy the earthly inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the same principle, once a person has been born again by God with His Spirit, that one is born unto a living hope, and this living hope is the inheritance of all the spiritual and heavenly blessings related to eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Daily we need to take possession of this inheritance and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This inheritance is legal, proper, and legitimate, for Christ has died to purchase it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He paid the price of His precious blood, and we have been sprinkled with this blood.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, every day we may enjoy the riches of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Daily we may participate in the inheritance that is ours today and for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In verse 4 Peter uses three words to describe our inheritance: incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Incorruptible refers to the substance, which is indestructible, not decaying; undefiled, to its purity, to its being unstained; unfading, to its beauty and glory, to its not withering.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In contrast to any earthly inheritance, our heavenly inheritance is incorruptible, for it is not material.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Anything material or physical is corruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But our inheritance kept in the heavens is divine and spiritual, altogether incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Furthermore, this inheritance cannot be defiled; nothing can make it unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Finally, it is unfading; its beauty and glory cannot wither.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These are the excellent qualities of our eternal inheritance in life.</S>
