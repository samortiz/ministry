   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEHOLDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most people understand beholding the Lord to mean looking up at a God who sits far above in the heavens and who sends His light down to men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They consider beholding God to be looking up to such a light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to our spiritual experience, however, this is not the meaning of beholding God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Beholding God is to gaze and look at God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I meet with a friend, we typically look each other in the eye and measure each other before we say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes after speaking, we look at each other again before we depart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our looking at each other conveys a kind of warmth and intimacy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is impossible for two persons to speak to each other without looking at each other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same way, beholding God means to gaze on Him when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After we pray a few sentences, we should turn to gaze on Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not turn to God or do not fix our gaze on Him but instead hastily utter a few words, it will be difficult for us to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we pray, we must be calm, turn to our spirit, and gaze on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then according to the feeling within, we can speak to Him under His gaze.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should continually behold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such beholding is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, beholding transpires only in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not behold with our physical eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our eyes are closed when we pray; we do not see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our spirit, however, we are before God and look at Him face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We gaze on God by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>WAITING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many people think that they need to wait on God when He does not answer their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Generally speaking, this can be considered as waiting on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is an outward waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, we are speaking of the waiting that transpires in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose we are calm and turn to our spirit, but we do not sense that we have the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a spiritual fact God never leaves us, but in our experience we may sense that He is far away or that He is near us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At times we may feel that He is near, but He has not initiated anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When this happens, we should not say anything quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, we should spend some time to wait in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God should always take the full initiative in our prayer, and we should simply follow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should pray according to the feelings He gives us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same principle, sometimes He purposely delays His coming so that we learn to wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot care merely for our convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must care for His convenience and wait.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should never be rash or impatient.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason the psalms say that we should wait on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This kind of waiting is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We would not consider two hours to be too long to converse with a close friend, but we would consider two hours to be a long time to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Waiting requires patience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we pray, there is also the need to wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes God likes to test us in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If He does not seem to be near us after we turn to our spirit, and there are no feelings within, we should not initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there is no feeling within, there can be no prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should learn to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When He moves, we should follow, and when He does not move, we should wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Can we spend half an hour to quietly wait on Him without uttering any words?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Can we happily tell others that we spent our morning waiting on the Lord in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Can we wait for a long time without praying to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps after waiting for some time, we may need to say, Lord, I must go to work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am unable to wait on You any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Can we do this?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we desire to enjoy God in prayer, we must learn these lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is difficult for rough and rash people to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Old Testament the priest s garment had bells at the hem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The sound of the bells was to warn the high priest not to be careless Exo 28:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who come before God must not be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord prefers us to listen to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, He rebuked Martha for being so anxious and troubled about many things Luke 10:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not believe Martha could wear the priestly garment without there being the sounds of bells everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many people are like Martha.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those with quick and rash temperaments cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have to learn to wait patiently on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>MUSING</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Good prayer often does not need many words.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At times we do not need to say anything when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can simply muse on God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He cares for our musing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Psalm 104:34 says, May my musing be sweet to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Prayers in which we continually speak to God may not be good prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In good prayer we behold God and muse upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may think that musing is something of our mind, but it is actually connected to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We actively muse upon the attributes of our God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is fine, tender, careful, dignified, glorious, and great.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We muse upon His dealings with us and His promises to us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As we muse, our inner being is filled with much feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our musings are prayers, and at the same time they are not prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They are like words, yet they are not like words.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They are thoughts that arise from our inner being and are a delight to God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In summary, we should turn to our spirit to touch God in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>These prayers do not require many words.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Sometimes it is best to spend some time to look at God or remain silent in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should learn to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should never pray with our own burdens; rather, we should set aside our burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should say, Lord, I give all my burdens to You and come to You with an unloaded spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should be calm, turn to our spirit, and behold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should then pray according to the inward sense.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As we pray, we should continue to behold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should also wait and muse on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we do this, we will touch and absorb God richly through prayer.</S>
