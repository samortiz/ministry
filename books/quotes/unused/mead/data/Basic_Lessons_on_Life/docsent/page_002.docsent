   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With the breath of life for a spirit that man may receive God Prov 20:27; John 4:24; Rom 8:16.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God breathed the breath of life into man.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man being created a vessel to receive and contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This series of brief messages on life and service are being given for the purpose of training the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need to pray much to get yourself into these messages, and even to get these messages into you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Merely to repeat what is here in black and white will be a kind of dead speaking of knowledge according to the dead letter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These messages may be considered as groceries, which you need to cook in a living way through much, much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have to pray yourself into the message, pray yourself into a burden, and pray that the message will become your personal message in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These are just the materials, but you have to cook them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to labor on all these points, and you have to pray until you yourself get into these messages, making them your own messages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then you will speak not my message but your message, and you will speak out from your being with much exercise of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then whatever you speak will be living, will be personal, and will be with the living impact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do hope that we will not carry out this training in a light way but in a way full of prayer, full of the Spirit, and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this first lesson on life, we want to speak about the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to read all the verses cited in the Scripture reading above and be impressed with the main points of these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I. THE CREATOR THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Creator of man is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man's creation was wrapped up with the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was not merely God who created man but it was the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is based upon Genesis 1:26, which says, "God said, Let us make man in our image."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here the plural pronouns us and our are used, indicating that the very God who intended to create man was triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Genesis 1:26, it seems that before God came in to create man, the Triune God had a kind of "Godhead conference," a kind of conference among the Trinity, to make a decision about how to create man in His image and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The decision to create man was made by the Triune God, indicating that the creation of man was for the purpose of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Trinity of the Godhead is not for theological doctrine, but for the dispensing of God Himself into man according to His divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, at the very beginning when God intended to create man, God decided to do so in His Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why He said, "Let us make man in our image."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's intention in creating man was to carry out His economy for His dispensing of Himself into man.</S>
