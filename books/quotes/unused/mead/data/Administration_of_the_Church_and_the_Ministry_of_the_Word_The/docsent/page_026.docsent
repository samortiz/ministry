   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING SOLVING ALL THE PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE CHURCH AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BRINGING IN GOD S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul was the greatest apostle of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, when he wrote the Epistle of 1 Corinthians, he said, Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul s reference to Sosthenes shows that he had a consciousness of the Body and a spirit of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is doubtful whether many people have paid attention to the name of Sosthenes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostle s spirit is different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The isolation among us is becoming more serious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everyone is capable, the younger ones and the older ones, and it seems as if there is no need to depend on one another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The older ones think that they are more experienced and know everything concerning the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They feel that they know how to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though they might not say this, it is the attitude in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can be polite and call this a spirit of tearing down, but it is actually a spirit of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a brother speaks, some may be critical and say in their heart, I know this already.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of spirit is destructive to God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not expect our work to be blessed if we are isolated and individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not expect such a work to produce the building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since we minister the word and participate in God s work to some extent, there will be some results.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even the work of the Catholic Church produces some results.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must ask, however, whether this work is producing what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Can the Catholic Church edify two or three million people so that they are in one accord, love one another, and stand for God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The people they edify will be full of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is not able to build in them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He cannot gain a dwelling place, a habitation, in them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the Lord s mercy, may we see that we need to be built and labor in a work that builds up others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we bring people to salvation, there must be an element of building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we bring people to salvation, we not only need to make them spiritual, but we also need to build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After being led to the Lord by us, they should not only love the Lord but also be built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same principle, the elders not only need to administrate the church, but they also need to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the brothers and sisters under the elders administration will be in one accord and will be willing to submit to others, considering submission as their glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the glorious work that we need to do here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Capacity alone is not the only measure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Compared to the elders, some younger brothers may be keener in terms of skill and mental capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But this does not mean that they can serve as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The qualification for being an elder does not depend on skill or mental capacity but on being broken and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is possible for our service as elders to produce saints who are dissenting and rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our service may save people and cause them to be spiritual and love the Lord zealously, but they will not be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please allow me to say a solemn word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since the beginning of the year I have felt that Satan wants us to do a work that is spiritual and full of zeal but which tears down and is lacking in mutual submission.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many young brothers have been poisoned in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to proclaim a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who desire to serve the Lord must take the way of building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If there is edification but no building, this is the way of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there is spirituality but no building, this is the way of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Throughout the two thousand years of church history no person was useful in God s hand who was unwilling to put himself under God s hand and be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The work God desires today is not only to save sinners or edify the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The primary work of God is to build a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should never think that the building is not essential or can be easily manufactured.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God must do much work in order to build up an isolated person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He wants us to enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He wants us to be built up with others into His glorious dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Unless we are coordinated and built up with others, we cannot enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we can coordinate, God will add others to us who can also coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If God cannot build in us today, He will still do it later.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who enter into God s glory must be built by God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to be built, it is crucial that we are able to coordinate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order to coordinate with others, we need to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may consider ourselves to be an excellent stone but be unable to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Likewise, we may consider someone who is able to coordinate with others to be an ugly stone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This only shows that being able to be built with others, not spirituality, is what matters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not easy for God to find a group of people who is willing to be subdued and built up by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God wants to pour out His blessing, but it is not easy for Him to find such a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord said that if two or three are gathered in harmony, He will be with them, and their prayer will be answered Matt 18:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In other words, God s blessing is wherever the building is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If one-tenth of the serving ones in Taipei are in one accord, God s blessing will follow their service.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the contrary, even if there are no arguments in a locality, if there is no building, God s blessing will not be present.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God s blessing is based on our one accord, being in harmony in spirit with one another, having real coordination, and having genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For example, if five brothers and four sisters meet together, the brothers should be submissive toward one another just like the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If a brother chooses a hymn, everyone should sing together with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Such a condition and spirit will bring in God s blessing.</S>
