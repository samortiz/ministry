<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BELIEVERS' PROPER ATTITUDE<br>TOWARD THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 4:8; Phil. 3:20; 1 Thes. 1:10; Rev. 22:20; 2 Pet. 1:19; Matt. 24:32-33, 42-44; 25:13; Luke 21:34-36; Rev. 3:10; Matt. 25:4, 10; 24:45-51; 25:19-30; 1 Cor. 3:10-17; Rev. 16:15</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Loving His appearing&#151;2 Tim. 4:8.</li><li>Earnestly awaiting His return&#151;Phil. 3:20; 1 Thes. 1:10.</li><li>Calling for His return&#151;Rev. 22:20.</li><li>Giving heed to the prophetic word as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts&#151;2 Pet. 1:19.</li><li>Giving heed to the fig tree, signifying the nation of Israel: seeing her branches become tender (the reestablishing of the nation of Israel) and put forth leaves (Israel's regaining of the capital, and other such events), and knowing that the summer (the restoration of the nation of Israel) is near&#151;Matt. 24:32-33.</li><li>Being watchful and being ready&#151;Matt. 24:42-44; 25:13.</li><li>Taking heed to ourselves lest at some time our hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and anxieties of life, and that day come upon us suddenly as a snare; for it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth&#151;Luke 21:34-35.</li><li>Being watchful, at every time beseeching, that we may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man, that is, to be raptured to the presence of Christ in heaven&#151;Luke 21:36</li><li>Keeping the word of the Lord's endurance, and being kept out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try those who dwell on the earth&#151;Rev. 3:10.</li><li>Being the prudent virgins with our souls, that is, our entire being, filled and saturated with the Spirit of God, lest we be shut outside of the marriage feast of Christ&#151;Matt. 25:4, 10.</li><li>Being a faithful and prudent slave, taking care of the Lord's church by giving food to the saints at the appointed time, that is, according to the gifts received, fully exercising our function lest we lose our reward and receive punishment&#151;Matt. 24:45-51; 25:19-30.</li><li>Being careful how we build the church on the foundation laid by the apostles, lest our building be consumed, bringing loss to ourselves so as through fire&#151;1 Cor. 3:10-17.</li><li>Being watchful to keep our garments, lest we walk naked&#151;Rev. 16:15.</li></ol><P>From the teaching of the New Testament, we can see that when the apostles, including Paul, were writing the New Testament, they thought that the Lord Jesus would come back in their lifetime. The prophets in the Old Testament, in foretelling the coming of Christ, thought that He would have only one coming. But actually, there are two comings of Christ. Moreover, these two comings are separated by at least two thousand years. This is like two peaks of a mountain. When looking from afar, they seem to be joined together, one stacked in front of the other. When we read these prophecies now, we know that the Lord's coming is at two times. Moreover, the second coming of Christ will not be as soon as the apostles thought.</P><P>Some may wonder why the Lord's return is not yet fulfilled now that the two thousand years have nearly passed. Did not the Lord say at the end of the Bible, at the conclusion of Revelation 22, that He would come quickly? We should not forget that to the Lord, a thousand years are as one day (2 Pet. 3:8). To the eternal Lord God, time is not a factor. In fulfilling the promise of His return, what is important is not time, but the facts. Today, as I stand before you, I can say with assurance that the time of waiting will not be very long, because from the various prophecies of the Bible, and in comparing these prophecies with the present world situation, we can see that the Lord's coming is near.</P>
