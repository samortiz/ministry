   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Do we believe that it is easy for the Triune God to mingle Himself with us?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If I want to mingle flour with oil, the flour does not struggle with me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is "obedient" and "submissive."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when the Triune God comes to us to mingle Himself with us, do we agree?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most of the time we are like naughty children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a mother wants to give a dose of medicine to her child, the child may refuse to take it and struggle with her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are like this with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who is submissive among us?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do we submit ourselves to our circumstances?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do we submit ourselves to our environment?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Usually, we do not go along with our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, we are altogether rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why the divine mingling of the divine persons with us does not go quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I can testify that the Triune God has been mingling Himself with me for over sixty-six years, but this mingling has not yet been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The mingling revealed in Ephesians 4, the mingling of the Divine Trinity with us, does not go so smoothly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ephesians 4 shows us the divine mingling and the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, the divine mingling is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, the building is taking place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mingling and building are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They are like two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the divine mingling stops, the building stops.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From God's side, we need the mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From our side, we need the building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Much of the time we resist the Triune God's efforts to mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why it is so difficult for the elders in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be an elder is very demanding because all of us children of God are naughty children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes I wondered why God begot so many naughty children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems that God chose all the naughty ones of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a meeting, we may behave ourselves as ladies and gentlemen, but when the meeting is dismissed, we immediately begin to misbehave.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since this is the case, how can the churches be built up?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When can we see the building consummated?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The mingling cannot go smoothly, and the building is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is everything so sweet and pleasant in the local churches?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are the mingling and building going on smoothly?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is every day a clear day or a cloudy day?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I would say that it is probably more than cloudy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the church life in the Lord's recovery, we have periodic storms.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows that we need to give ourselves to the Lord so that the divine mingling can proceed and so that the building of the Body can be consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul received a vision of this mingling and building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He received a trance, and in that trance he saw all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, he prayed for us that we might also have a trance, that is, that we might have a spirit of wisdom and revelation Eph 1:17 .</S>
