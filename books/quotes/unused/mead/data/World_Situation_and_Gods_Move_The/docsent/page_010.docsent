   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the fall of 1943 Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek met at Cairo for a conference to discuss the war and the postwar problems.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Roosevelt proposed getting rid of the Japanese emperor, Chiang Kai-shek advised against this, pointing out that the emperor was needed as a figurehead in order to keep the Japanese people under control.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the secret Yalta agreements in 1945 Roosevelt agreed to give Stalin Russia's former rights in Manchuria, which Japan had taken over.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The United States withdrew.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The two Communist countries, Russia and China, should have been friendly toward each other, but six or seven years after the Communist takeover of China they had a dispute over the territory of Siberia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This led to a break and an end to their friendship.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their statesmen urged them to be friendly toward China, rather than attack it.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In spite of all their forces, their bombings, their brutality toward the women, they were utterly unable to subdue so many millions of people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Besides a large territory and a big population, natural resources and skills are also needed in order for a country to be powerful today.</S>
