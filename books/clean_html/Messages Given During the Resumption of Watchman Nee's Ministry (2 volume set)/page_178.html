It is no longer my own business, but the Body's business." This is rightly put. Your burden is no longer on your shoulders, but on the shoulders of the brothers and sisters and the church. If you hand yourself over, everything becomes the Lord's. If you make money, it is God who is making the money; and if you lose money, it is God who is losing the money. Our principle is to let the dead bury the dead. We have to know that to serve God is not just a matter of serving God alone, but to serve Him in the Body. Today, by the grace of God, we have handed ourselves over. If you merely say with your mouth that you are serving God, nobody knows when you have stopped this service. This kind of service is not definite. However, if you hand yourself over, you cannot turn back even if you want to. You may say that you cannot walk, but many others will carry you; they can move you. If our service is for the church, we will be able to give up even the things that we could not otherwise give up. It is not a matter of my own arrangement, but a matter of the Lord's arrangement in the Body. It is a tremendous thing for a person to decide to consecrate himself. However, this thing is not done individually, but in the Body.</P><P>Brother Chow asked: In the future, should the brothers engage in business by using the name of the church? (No answer from Brother Nee.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SISTER RUTH LEE'S FELLOWSHIP AND TESTIMONY</H2><P>Sister Ruth Lee: I have asked for permission already from the other brothers concerning what I am about to say. It all happened about thirteen years ago. At that time I wanted to have an apartment, but I could not go into detail about the reason for having it...Although I have been negative in recent years, there was still a supply from the brothers. Brother Chu gave me ten thousand dollars, and when Brother Chang Tze-che came from Tsingtao, he gave me a few thousand dollars. From that time on, I decided to set aside a certain amount from what I have received...When I moved back from the countryside, I saw many more white-haired people in the church. The next time I came back, there were even more white hairs...The sisters had given up all their savings, and some sisters had to stay in the hospital and could not go home...What I have can only become less; it will never become more. All the money that I have is enough to feed one more person for a month only; it will be gone by the second month. I can sleep on the floor and let others sleep on my bed. But others will not feel comfortable sleeping this way. If we have to provide a place for others to rest, it should be a place where others can rest comfortably. I felt that somehow I have to have a place that is like a home, that others will not feel ashamed or burdensome to live in, and which is close to the meeting hall. Only then will such a place be able to render others some spiritual help...When a person gets older, she tends to develop her own peculiarities. Others say that living together provides fellowship. Actually, living together provides frustrations. This is why I have hoped all the time to have a place that can provide hospitality for the saints. Brother Lee said that perhaps they can provide a place for me in Chefoo.</P>
