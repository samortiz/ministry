   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A REVIEW OF THE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY FROM GENESIS TO JUDGES</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to see the significance of the sequence of the books of the Bible according to the crucial points in each book.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Genesis shows us God s creation and God s purpose in creation, which is to gain an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God made man in His image for His expression 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Genesis eventually reveals that God desires a house.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This revelation came to Jacob while he was fleeing from his brother, Esau, after taking Esau s birthright and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jacob had a dream from God, and upon waking from the dream, he prophetically named the place Bethel, which means the house of God 28:17-19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This prophecy concerning God s house was initially fulfilled at the end of Exodus when the tabernacle was built as God s dwelling place among His people 40:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Genesis and Exodus four basic items are revealed and applied by God: God s sent One, the tabernacle, the offerings, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the sent One, God came to His created and chosen people as an angel and as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first time God came to His people as a man was in Genesis 18.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Three men appeared to Abraham, and one of them was Jehovah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>13-14, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We know that Jehovah came to Abraham as a genuine man because Abraham washed His feet and served Him a meal vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>4-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jehovah also appeared several times in Genesis as the Angel of Jehovah, the sent One of God 16:7, 13; 22:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This sent One also appeared to Moses in Exodus 3, where the Angel of Jehovah is called Jehovah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2, 4 , the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob v. 6 , and I AM WHO I AM v. 14 . After Exodus 3, this Angel appeared quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Angel fought the battle for Israel against Pharaoh s army 14:19-20, 24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was continually with the children of Israel from the time they left Egypt and crossed the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Angel of Jehovah appeared several times in Judges.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the Angel appeared to Samson s parents, He was repeatedly called a man 13:3, 6, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Judges 13:20 says, When the flame went up from the altar to heaven, the Angel of Jehovah went up in the flame of the altar, while Manoah and his wife looked on.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>More than a thousand years before Christ ascended in a cloud Acts 1:9 , the Angel of Jehovah, as a man, ascended in the flame of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, the Angel of Jehovah was Christ as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Old Testament reveals that the Angel of Jehovah was Jehovah, and the name Jesus means Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The appearing of the Angel in Exodus issued in the children of Israel building the tabernacle, which is a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Exodus also mentions the offerings, which are described in detail in Leviticus, and are all types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 1, which is an extract of the entire Gospel of John, shows that Christ is the fulfillment of the tabernacle v. 14 , and as the Lamb of God, He is the aggregate and the fulfillment of all the offerings v. 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Exodus also contains several types of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The cloud fighting for Israel in 14:19-25 and covering the tabernacle in 40:34 typifies the Spirit 1 Cor 10:2; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The water that flowed out of the smitten rock in Exodus 17:6 also typifies the Spirit John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The compounded anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25 typifies the all-inclusive, compound Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; John 7:39; Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, by the end of Exodus we have seen the four major items: the Angel of Jehovah, God s sent One as a man; the tabernacle as the embodiment of the Triune God and His dwelling place among His people; the offerings as the means by which God s people enter into the enjoyment of the Triune God; and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These items are fully revealed and realized in Christ in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, we can see that the Old and New Testaments actually speak concerning one thing: God s economy to work Himself into His chosen people through the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Trinity is crucial for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If God were not triune, He would not be able to reach and enter into His creature man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order to dispense Himself into man, God had to be triune.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God needed to become a man as the sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This sent One also needed to be the embodiment of God and the reality of the offerings in order to be the means, the sphere, and the entrance for God s chosen ones to enter into the enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order for all these accomplishments to reach and be applied to God s people, the sent One had to be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because God is the Spirit, His people can drink Him, and He can anoint them as ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Triune God as the Spirit is mingled with His elect by entering into them as living water and covering them as the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the picture presented by both the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Apparently, the Old Testament contains biographies, history, poetry, and prophecy, and the New Testament contains accounts of the Lord s earthly ministry and the letters that the apostles wrote to the early churches.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, the Old Testament and the New Testament intrinsically reveal the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>While I am speaking, others see my clothing, my face, and my hair, but these things do not represent me.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is something more intrinsic, that is, what I am speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Bible similarly has an intrinsic content.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to get into this intrinsic content.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God s sent One, God s embodiment, the offerings, and God the Spirit are the intrinsic content, the innermost essence and elements, of the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The entire Bible is constructed with these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Primarily through these items, we have seen the Divine Trinity in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Judges.</S>
