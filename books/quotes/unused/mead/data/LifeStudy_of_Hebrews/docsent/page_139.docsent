   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Lord s New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that after the Lord left the covenant with us, it became the new testament containing all the accomplished facts as our bequests.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord s new testament is executed by the resurrected Christ as the Mediator in the heavens 9:15; 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While the Lord is resting on His throne in the heavens, He is concerned for all the heirs of this new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is concerned whether the heirs are wise and diligent enough to take the bequests, or whether they are trusting in their own cleverness and trying to do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because He is so concerned, He is interceding that we shall have the full realization of all the bequests contained in His bequeathed will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our eyes are opened to see this matter of the Lord s testament, we shall be beside ourselves and say, How poor the situation has been for over nineteen centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Very few Christians have realized these bequests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All Christians understand God s salvation in a low way according to the natural human concept, not in the way of bequests.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Have you ever heard that the forgiveness of sins is a bequest?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Were you ever taught that the imparting of the divine life, the rebirth, and our crucifixion with Christ are also bequests?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were crucified before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was accomplished by Christ on the cross and it is one of the many bequests itemized in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our perfection and glorification also are bequests.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the new testament, the new will, everything is a bequest which has been accomplished already.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the last portion of this new will, the book of Revelation, the Apostle John uses the past tense very often.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, in Revelation 20:10 John said that the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, and in 21:2 he said, I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both of these are in the past tense because every item in the will is a bequest, not a promise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In your preaching, have you ever told people of their bequests?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Most preachers say, If you believe, God will forgive your sins and you will be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to tell people, I have a will for you, God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will clearly says that all your sins were forgiven long before you even committed them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will also declares that your rebirth, justification, sanctification, perfection and glorification have all been accomplished by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these items are bequests presented to you in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Will you accept it?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you are willing to take it, just thank the Lord and receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a person will accept the will in this way, he will immediately have forgiveness of sins, rebirth, justification, sanctification, perfection, glorification, and even the New Jerusalem!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From now on, we must enjoy and partake of all the bequests itemized in the Lord s new will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we have this view, we shall be radically revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you have seen this matter of the new testament, you will no longer need to pray in a begging way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many Christians understand Ephesians 5:19 and 20 in this way: Praying to God continually, begging earnestly and fasting to the Lord, making petitions to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But these verses say, Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In these verses, there is no begging but praising and thanksgiving, because the Lord has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father promised everything and the Lord Jesus accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the accomplished facts have been itemized in the new will as our bequests.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not need to beg; we need to thank and praise the Lord for our bequests and enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we know God s economy, we shall praise the Lord and thank Him for all He has accomplished and bequeathed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose a relative has bequeathed a house to you in his will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no need for you to beg for that house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you learn that the house has been given to you, all you need to do is say thank you and accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no need for us to beg; we simply need to take with thanks to the Lord what has already been given to us in such an extraordinary way in the way of the new will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nothing is as binding and as strongly established as a will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one can change it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever is bequeathed in a will is final; it must go to whom it has been bequeathed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If our eyes could be opened to see that we have such a will, we would be beside ourselves with praise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need for people to wait for their rebirth, for that is an item in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They should simply accept regeneration as a bequest and say, Thank You, Lord, for such a wonderful rebirth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, thank You for the impartation of the divine life accomplished at the time of Your resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s selection is another bequest in the will, having been accomplished before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since this is clearly itemized as a bequest in Ephesians 1:4, there is no need to kneel down and pray, O God, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am a pitiful sinner, and hell is my destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>O God, please grant me Your selection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How foolish it is to pray in this way!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Simply say, Father, thank You for Your selection which has already been accomplished and bequeathed to me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s selection and predestination both are bequests of the new will which have already been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans 8:30 even tells us that we have already been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Glorification, into which we shall enter in the future, is also a bequest in the new will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In God s reckoning, it has been accomplished already.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to have the heavenly vision to see that all God s blessings are bequests.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do you need peace?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is a bequest.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was promised by the Father, accomplished by the Son, and has been itemized in the new will as your bequest.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Simply thank God for it and receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the new way to partake of God s blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not be a poor beggar you are a glorious inheritor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>An heir has no need to beg; he simply receives all the bequests with thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When my eyes were opened to see this matter of the bequests in the new testament, my whole concept was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is why I do not beg.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whenever I pray, I pray with the realization that everything was already given to me nineteen and a half centuries ago as a bequest in the divine will and that I can take all I need.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I can boldly say, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is mine and I take it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord s new testament is executed by the resurrected Christ as the Mediator, the Executor, in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today the resurrected Christ is executing this will by restfully interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The testament, the will, has been confirmed and validated by Christ s death and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The promise of God s covenant is insured by God s faithfulness, God s covenant is guaranteed by God s righteousness, and the new testament is enforced by Christ s resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christ is now on the throne interceding for us to realize this testament, this will.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All the seeking Christians throughout the world are hungry and thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you tell them about this will and its bequests, they will gladly receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They will be willing to give themselves to it and be consumed by it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This will has been given to the Lord s people for over nineteen centuries, but few of them have realized it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>By His mercy, the Lord has brought us into a full realization of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now He is speeding up His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The heavenly Intercessor is motivating and energizing us day by day with His heavenly pum, pum, pum that we may partake of all the riches of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the reason that the Christians in the Lord s recovery are so aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God s promises have all become accomplished facts in the new covenant, and the new covenant has been bequeathed to us as the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Now, in resurrection as the ascended One sitting on the throne in the heavens, Christ is executing what He has bequeathed.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The crucial point in this matter is the automatic and innate function of the law of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Praise the Lord!</S>
