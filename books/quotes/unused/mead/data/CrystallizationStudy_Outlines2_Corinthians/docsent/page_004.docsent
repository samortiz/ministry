   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The heavenly ink is the Spirit, and the essence of this Spirit-ink is Christ with all His riches; to have this ink in our experience, we must enjoy Christ, possess Christ, be filled with Christ, be saturated with Christ, and be covered with Christ 2 Cor 3:3; Gal 1:15a, 16a; 2:20; 4:19; Eph 3:8, 16-17a.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only One qualified to do the work of writing living letters of Christ is God 2 Cor 3:5-6: The living God Himself is the sufficiency, competency, and qualification of the apostles ministry for God s New Testament economy to dispense Christ into God s chosen people for the building up of the Body v. 5.</S>
