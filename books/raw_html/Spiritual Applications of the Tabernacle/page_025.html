 <h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS LIGHT IN RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Although there is no measurement for the lampstand, there are many occurrences of the number three in the description of the lampstand. Exodus 37:18 says, &ldquo;And there were six branches going out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand out of one of its sides, and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side.&rdquo; The lampstand had six branches, three on two sides. Three, here, represents resurrection, while two represents a testimony. On each branch there were three cups shaped like almond blossoms with calyxes and blossom buds (v. 19). The calyx is the leafy green layer of a flower, while the blossom bud is the flower itself. The word <em>cup</em> is used to describe the whole flower, including the calyx and the blossom bud. In addition to a calyx and the blossom bud, an almond blossom also has the almond fruit. The whole flower, including calyx and blossom, was a cup to bear the oil for shining the light.</p>
<p>According to Numbers 17:8, Aaron&rsquo;s rod budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds. This is a picture of resurrection, life coming out of death. Aaron&rsquo;s rod was a dead stick, but through resurrection it brought forth almonds. The almond blossoms with the calyxes and blossom buds depict the issue of the resurrection life of Christ. Christ as light to us is the issue of Christ as life to us. The resurrection life of Christ is for the light. Christ could be light to us by passing through resurrection.</p>
<p>The lampstand is full of symbols of resurrection. Every branch of the lampstand is like a branch of an almond tree. Furthermore, the many occurrences of groups of three on the lampstand indicate resurrection. On each branch of the lampstand were three almond blossoms with a calyx and blossom bud. When the flower blossoms, it yields the almond as fruit. This indicates that the resurrection life is the light to us.</p>
<p>Exodus 37:20-21 says, &ldquo;And on the lampstand were four cups made like almond blossoms, its calyxes and its blossom buds; and a calyx under two branches of one piece with it, and a calyx under two branches of one piece with it, and a calyx under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it.&rdquo; There were six branches, and at the base where each pair of branches met there was a calyx. On each of the six branches there were three calyxes. Three branches were on one side, and three branches were on the other side. At the base of three pairs of branches were three calyxes, and on each branch there were three almond blossoms. This totaled to seven groups of three blossoms.</p>
<p>On the shaft of the lampstand there were an additional four almond blossoms (v. 20). It is very meaningful that there is at least one mention of the number four in the lampstand. If there had been no number four, the lampstand may have had nothing to do with us as the creatures. Thus, with the lampstand there are the number three and the number six, and with the shaft of the lampstand there is the number four. The basic number is three, signifying that the entire lampstand is a matter of resurrection. But this resurrection is for man, the creature, because Christ as light is a man, that is, a creature, as signified by the four almond blossoms on the shaft. If He were not a creature, He would be the light, but He would not be light to us. Because He is a creature, He is light to man, who is signified by the number six, since man was created on the sixth day. The light of Christ is wholly a matter in resurrection. Christ is life and light in resurrection, but He is also a creature that He may be light to man. Moreover, verse 24 says that the lampstand was of a talent of gold, signifying the divine nature. The light of the lampstand is the divine light of the divine nature.</p>
