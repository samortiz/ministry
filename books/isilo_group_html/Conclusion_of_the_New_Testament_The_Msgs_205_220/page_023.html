Verse 5 says, &#8220;Adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue, and in virtue knowledge.&#8221; The word &#8220;supply&#8221; in verse 5 actually means develop. Hence, to supply virtue in faith is to develop virtue in the exercise of faith, in the exercise of the like precious faith allotted to us by God (v. 1) as the common portion of the New Testament blessing for the initiation of the Christian life.<p>The virtue in verse 5 refers to that mentioned in verse 3, where Peter speaks of the One who has &#8220;called us to His own glory and virtue.&#8221; Furthermore, this virtue is related to the divine nature (v. 4), which denotes the riches of what God is. The virtue in verses 3 and 5 is, therefore, the issue of the experience of the divine nature in verse 4. When we partake of the divine nature, the different aspects of the riches of what God is, these riches become our virtues.<p>In verse 5 Peter also tells us to supply &#8220;in virtue knowledge.&#8221; Virtue, the vigorous action, needs the bountiful supply of the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord (vv. 2, 3, 8) regarding the all things related to the divine life and godliness and the partaking of the divine nature for our enjoyment in the development described in verses 5 through 7. This knowledge is actually the knowledge of all things related to life and godliness. We must have this knowledge developed in our virtue.<p>In verse 6 Peter continues, &#8220;And in knowledge self-control, and in self-control endurance, and in endurance godliness.&#8221; Self-control is the exercise of control and restraint over the self in its passions, desires, and habits. Whereas self-control is related to the self, endurance is related to others and to our circumstances. As to ourselves, we must have self-control, and as to our circumstances, no matter what they may be, we need endurance. Then in our endurance we need to develop godliness, a living that is like God and expresses God. As we exercise control over the self and bear with others and with circumstances, godliness needs to be developed in our spiritual life so that we can be like God and express Him.<p>In verse 7 Peter concludes, &#8220;And in godliness brotherly love, and in brotherly love love.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;brotherly love&#8221; is philadelphia, composed of phileo, to have affection for, and adelphos, a brother; hence, brotherly affection, a love of delight and pleasure. The Greek word for love in verse 7 is agape, the word used in the New Testament for the divine love, which God is in His nature (1 John 4:8, 16). It is nobler than phileo, and it adorns all the qualities of the Christian life (1 Cor. 13; Rom. 13:8-10; Gal. 5:13-14). It is stronger in ability and greater in capacity than human love (Matt. 5:44, 46), yet a believer who lives by the divine life and partakes of the divine nature can be saturated with it and express it in full. Such a love needs to be developed in brotherly love, to govern it and flow in it for the expression of God, who is this love.<p>Faith may be considered the seed of life, and love, the fruit in its full development. This development includes virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, and godliness. Eventually, we have the full development and maturity from the seed of faith, through the roots of virtue and knowledge, the trunk of self-control, and the branches of endurance and godliness, to the blossom and fruit of brotherly love and love. Verse 11 indicates that, as a result of the growth and development of the divine life unto maturity, the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to us.<p>According to Peter&#8217;s word in 1:5-11, to grow to maturity is to develop what we have already received. We have been allotted the like precious faith, which is an all-inclusive seed. All the divine riches are in this seed, but we must be diligent to develop them into virtue. Then we need to develop in our virtue, knowledge; in knowledge, self-control; in self-control, endurance; in endurance, godliness; in godliness, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love. Through such a growth and development we eventually shall reach maturity and shall have a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.<p>The fact that those who develop and grow in the life of God in the church life will have a rich entrance into the coming kingdom implies that certain believers will not have a share in the coming kingdom, because they have not been living in the proper church life and have not had the adequate growth in the divine life. For this reason, at the time of the manifestation of the kingdom, they will have no participation in the kingdom. But those who grow and develop in the divine life to the full extent will be supplied with a rich and bountiful entry into the coming kingdom.<p>We have seen three aspects of the status of the church: first, the church as an assembly separated from the world; second, the church as the house of God composed of those who have been born of God; and third, the church as the kingdom of God, which is the reality and living of the church today. We all need to grow in the divine life in the church life so that in the coming age we may have a rich entrance into the kingdom of God.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 205-220) &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
