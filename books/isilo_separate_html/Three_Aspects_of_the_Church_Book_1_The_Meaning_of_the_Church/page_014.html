<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S WORK TO RECOVER<br />
THE ONENESS IN THE UNIVERSE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Ephesians 1:10, 22; 4:13</h1>
<h2 class="head3">Satan Damaging the Oneness of God&rsquo;s Creation through Death</h2>
<p>The oneness of God&rsquo;s creation was damaged by Satan. Satan damaged the element of oneness by introducing death into all creation. Death had three spiritual consequences. First, it severed the Creator&rsquo;s relationship with the creation; second, it caused the creation to lose its original function with respect to the Creator; and third, it caused the creation to be corrupted and abandoned. Nevertheless, God is now recovering us with His life so that we may be joined to Him. He is recovering our function toward God, and He is recovering God&rsquo;s life, which is indestructible, incorruptible, and unchangeable.</p>
<p>When all things were separated from God, the oneness of God&rsquo;s creation was lost. The center of the universe is God Himself. Hence, the oneness of the universe is also God Himself. Once the created universe lost God and its relationship with God was severed, it lost its center. Colossians 1:20 says, &ldquo;Having made peace through the blood of His cross.&rdquo; Peace in this verse does not merely refer to sinners being reconciled to God but also to a restoration of the relationship between the universe and God, in which there is no separation from God. Through the blood of Christ, God and the universe are in one accord and in harmony. This harmony is the great oneness of the universe. However, when Satan introduced death into the universe, the universe was separated from God, and the one accord and the oneness were lost. Thus, there is not full harmony. Wars being fought among the nations and people killing one another demonstrate the lack of harmony and oneness among men. Even the fact that mosquitoes bite people shows that there is no oneness in the universe. The universe has lost its oneness because it has been separated from God, the source of oneness. Peace and harmony can be found only in God.</p>
<p>The disharmony in the universe will continue until the restoration of all things, that is, until the coming of the millennial kingdom. Romans 8:19 says that the creation is anxiously watching, eagerly awaiting the revelation of the sons of God. The revelation of the sons of God will occur when the sons of God reach maturity. In the restoration of all things, vipers will not hurt people, and lions will not bite or harm people. This is the condition of the kingdom as depicted in Isaiah 11:6-8: &ldquo;The wolf will dwell with the lamb; / And the leopard will lie down with the kid, / And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; / ...The nursing child will play by the cobra&rsquo;s hole, / And upon the viper&rsquo;s den / The weaned child will stretch his hand.&rdquo; On that day all things in the universe will be in harmony. Men will not war any longer, and all the weapons of war will be changed in their nature (2:4). Furthermore, at that time &ldquo;the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, / And the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of seven days&rdquo; (30:26). The Jews and the Gentiles will minister to the one God and be in complete harmony (56:6). Isaiah presents a thorough description of the harmonious situation that will occur upon the restoration of all things in the future. God is working continuously until the day when all matters, things, men, and God will be in one accord.</p>
<p>The situation in the restoration and the issue produced from death are totally contrary. When death entered, all things lost the oneness and entered into darkness. If we do not have light in a meeting, we will fall into darkness and confusion. Death brings in darkness, and darkness brings in confusion. If there is a condition of confusion among the brothers and sisters, we know that they are in darkness and lack life. On the contrary, life brings in light, and light brings in oneness. In the restoration of all things, everything will be in the light, and all things will be in harmony with one another. At that time, &ldquo;They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain, / For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah, / As water covers the sea&rdquo; (11:9). Harmony results from the knowledge of Jehovah. The knowledge of Jehovah is light. Today, however, in the universe there is no harmony, because all things have been separated from their Creator and have fallen into death.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
