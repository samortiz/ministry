   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO CATEGORIES OF HEALING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to have a clear understanding of the two categories of healing in Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The four cases in the first category are related to being enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The four cases in the second category are related to the recovery of the crucial organs of hearing, speaking, and seeing, the spiritual organs necessary for contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 5:21-43 we have the healing of a woman with a flow of blood and the raising up of a dead girl.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The case of the woman with the flow of blood is a case of the leaking out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since this woman s case is merged with that of the girl and since the twelve years of the woman s sickness equal the age of the girl and both are females, these cases may be considered the case of one person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this view, the girl was born, so to speak, in the woman s death-sickness and died of it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the woman s death-sickness was healed by the Savior, the girl rose up from death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 7:24-30 we have the case of casting a demon out of a Syrophoenician woman s daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are told in 7:26 that the woman was a Greek, Syrophoenician by race.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She was Syrian by tongue, Phoenician by race see Acts 21:2-3 , and the Phoenicians being descendants of the Canaanites a Canaanite woman Matt 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What made her a Greek religion, marriage, or something else is difficult to discover.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although this woman was threefold a Gentile, in the sight of God she was a little dog whom He loved vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we put all these cases together, realizing that they make up a composite portrait of Peter, our representative, we shall see that these cases indicate that Peter was fully healed and recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter two of Acts, Peter is not only alive; he is strong in life and in the ability to hear, speak, and see.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE CONDITION OF MAN S HEART</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 7:1-23 the Lord Jesus exposes the condition of man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this section of Mark the Lord is a surgeon who opens our inner being and exposes its true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 7:20 the Lord says, That which goes out of a man, that defiles a man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then He lists a number of evil things that proceed out of the heart of men vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After this, He concludes, All these wicked things proceed from within, and they defile a man v. 23 . We all need to see man s inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need to realize that there is nothing good in the heart of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TWO CASES OF FEEDING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After the exposure of the heart, there are two cases of feeding: the feeding of the Gentiles as the little dogs under the table 7:27-30 and the feeding of four thousand 8:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 7:27 the Lord Jesus said to the Syrophoenician woman, Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children s bread and throw it to the little dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The woman answered, Yes, Lord, but even the little dogs under the table eat of the little children s crumbs 7:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Jews were regarded as God s children, and here the Gentiles are portrayed as little dogs, not as wild dogs, but as pet dogs, little dogs under the family table.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the children were eating at the table, the pet dogs were waiting under the table for any crumbs that might fall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those crumbs became the portion of the pet dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we see that the Lord is not only the children s bread on the table, but also the crumbs under the table.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is even the portion of the little dogs, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 8:1-9 we have the feeding of the four thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the people ate and were satisfied, they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE UNVEILING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>WITH HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 8:27 9:1 we have the unveiling of Christ with His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before that time, the Lord Jesus had not been unveiled to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They followed Him blindly, without realizing who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then at the end of chapter eight the Lord brought them away from the religious atmosphere of Jerusalem to the clear atmosphere of Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>8:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They replied, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, one of the prophets v. 28 . Then the Lord questioned them, But you, who do you say that I am? v. 29 . Peter took the lead to declare, You are the Christ! He saw the vision that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Immediately, the Lord went on to speak to them concerning His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, here we have the unveiling of the Person of Christ and also the unveiling of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In these verses we have the crucial revelation of the Person of Christ with His death and resurrection.</S>
