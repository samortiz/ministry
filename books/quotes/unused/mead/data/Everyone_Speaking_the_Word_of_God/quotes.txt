[1]  The messages contained in this book and in two related books entitled The Full Knowledge of the Word of God and Meeting to Speak the Word of God were given in October, 1985 in Taipei, Taiwan during a training in which the author spoke three times daily.
[2]  THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: Num 11:29; 1 Cor 9:16-17; 14:31 OUTLINE God s desire: Spoken by Moses in the Old Testament Num 11:29.
[3]  I have read the Bible for many years, but not until recently did I discover that in the book of Numbers in the Old Testament there is the concept that everyone must speak the word of God, or that everyone may speak the word of God, or, we might say, that everyone is able to speak the word of God.
[4]  In summary we might say that one who is saved, one who serves the Lord, has the qualification, the right, the ability, and also the responsibility and burden to speak the word of God.
[5]  We have already seen that God desires all men to come to the full knowledge of the truth 1 Tim 2:4 ; this is God s heart s desire.
[6]  A second desire of God s heart is that we would speak for Him.
[7]  In America I incurred the displeasure of the sisters by saying to them, Sisters, you have a particular characteristic: when you are on the telephone, you seem to be glued to the phone, and you are not able to put it down.
[8]  After you were saved, time after time when you came to the meeting, were there not many times when you felt that you should speak, but after some consideration you eventually did not speak?
[9]  When you speak the Lord s word, the more you speak, the happier you will be; the more you speak, the healthier you will be.
[10]  In Taipei we have more than four thousand brothers and sisters in the meetings.
[11]  This number may not be large compared to the total population, but if over four thousand brothers and sisters all speak the word of the Lord in every place, this will be a tremendous matter.
[12]  The Lord Jesus said, But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth Acts 1:8 .
[13]  Today the important biblical truths have been made clear in our publications, but what I fear is that we all may say that we have already heard these things.
[14]  Being filled with the Holy Spirit and speaking the word of God Acts 4:31.
[15]  I hope that when you speak God s word to others, you will not just tell them that the Word of God is very good, and that the word in your church is the richest of all.
[16]  I hope that you will not merely tell people that previously you were not able to speak, but now you are able; that formerly you were dumb, but now you open your mouth; that previously you had no boldness, but now you have boldness; or that previously you had no eloquence, but now you have eloquence.
[17]  Now you have the treasure the Word of God.
[18]  In Acts 6:4 the twelve Apostles said, But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.
[19]  At the same time you must have the faith, asking the Spirit of the Lord not the essential Spirit but the economical Spirit, the poured out Spirit to be with you, just as in Acts 4:31, And as they were beseeching, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.
[20]  OF THE WORD OF GOD 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 20:32; Eph 1:13; Acts 8:4; 1 John 1:1; Phil 2:16; 1 Tim 6:3; 2 Tim 1:13; Eph 4:29; Heb 6:5; 5:13; 1 Cor 12:8 OUTLINE What aspect of the word of God should we speak?
[21]  I cannot say that every time I speak for the Lord I am filled with the Holy Spirit or have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but I can tell you that many times I knew that indeed I had the filling of the Holy Spirit; this was undeniable.
[22]  We all should realize that the Lord in whom we believe is the Lord who accomplished these seven great items: as God He was incarnated; He passed through human living; His all-inclusive death solved all our problems; He was resurrected, and He caused us to be resurrected together with Him in order that we might be regenerated; then He became the life-giving Spirit and breathed Himself into us; He ascended to the height and was made both Lord and Christ; and as the outpoured Spirit, who is also the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit, He poured Himself upon us, the church.
[23]  When you exercise to speak the word of God to others, you must believe that you have the Spirit within you and that you also have the Spirit upon you.
[24]  We pray, and we believe that we have the Spirit of power upon us.
[25]  There are ten major categories of the word of God: the word of grace, the word of truth, the word of the gospel, the word of life, the healthy word, the edifying word, the good word, the word of righteousness, the word of knowledge, and the word of wisdom.
[26]  To speak the word of God to people is to speak these ten major categories of the word.
[27]  Some words are not healthy, but all healthy words contain life, and health pertains to life.
[28]  He knew that some had come out teaching differently; therefore, in chapter one he said to Timothy, I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently v. 3 . For the believers to receive the different teachings would be like their eating stones or lumps of coal; these things are not nutritious.
[29]  OF THE WORD OF GOD 2 Scripture Reading: Acts 8:29-31, 34-35 OUTLINE Approaching people, helping people, and knowing people: Following the leading of the Spirit to approach people Acts 8:29-30.
[30]  The book of Hebrews conveys to us the word of righteousness.
[31]  He is also the Son of God, the effulgence of God s glory, and the express image of God s substance v. 3 . He was resurrected from among the dead, becoming the firstborn Son of God, and will return with the status of the firstborn Son v. 6 . Such a One, of course, is much higher than the angels, who are revered in Judaism.
[32]  Chapter two also says that this One is the Son of God, but because He became incarnated, taking a human body of flesh and blood, He was temporarily made a little inferior to the angels v. 7 . While He lived on this earth, He passed through all kinds of trials and temptations v. 10 . Through His death He redeemed us from our sins and did away with the Devil, who had the power of death v. 14 . Then He was resurrected.
[33]  The first part of chapter eight says that this Apostle from God has enacted a new covenant for us.
[34]  After shedding His blood for this covenant, He, in resurrection and ascension, has become the Executor of this covenant; therefore, He is the Mediator of the new covenant v. 6 . In this new covenant our sins are truly forgiven, and we have also received the divine life and the law of life vv.
[35]  I have spoken in the past concerning the two becomings of Christ.
[36]  The first becoming is the Word became flesh John 1:14 , and the second becoming is the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[37]  Because the book of Hebrews speaks these words of righteousness in every section, it issues serious warnings according to these words.
[38]  The first two chapters tell us that Christ is the complete God and a perfect man, far superior to the angels, becoming our great salvation.
[39]  Based on this word, the second warning is issued in the section from 3:7 to 4:13, saying, Do not harden your hearts 3:8 , so that you will not provoke God s wrath and be unable to enter into the rest of the coming kingdom.
[40]  This righteous word does not mean that the saved persons can still perish forever and miss the enjoyment of God s eternal rest; rather, it means that if we neglect the righteous word of God and allow an evil heart of unbelief or the sins of a hardened heart to deceive us 3:11-12 , when the Lord comes we will not enter into the millennial kingdom and enjoy the rest of reigning with Him in the kingdom.
[41]  This solemn and righteous word, of course, does not mean that we who are saved by grace may perish forever; rather, it means that after we receive the Lord s salvation, if we do not come forward to enter into the realm of the Lord s ascension and enjoy all the riches of His heavenly ministry, when He comes back we will surely receive His severe dealing and punishment.
[42]  The seventh point under Everyone Speaking the Word of God is Approaching People, Helping People, and Knowing People.
[43]  If you desire to speak to people, you must approach them.
[44]  At that time, the Spirit of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Approach and join this chariot v. 29 . Philip then ran to the eunuch and heard him reading the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, and asked him, Do you really know what you are reading? v. 30 . The eunuch said, How can I unless someone guides me? And he asked Philip to come up to the chariot v. 31 . Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from the scripture, He was led as a sheep to slaughter... v. 32; cf.
[45]  The word of God being parallel with the testimony of Jesus Rev 1:2, 9: Speaking the word of God being to testify how the person, living, and work of Jesus Christ is the testimony of God.
[46]  Today our speaking for the Lord is our testifying for the Lord.
[47]  The word of God speaks concerning the Lord, that is, concerning the Lord s person, living, and work.
[48]  They cannot speak concerning the fact that the Lord was God in eternity past, and that He was then conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of Mary and was born of Mary, having both the divine element and the human element.
[49]  We have said that everyone needs to speak the word of God.
[50]  We must pray to be filled with the Holy Spirit, and we must experience life.
