   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX PORTIONS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REVEALING THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE DIVINE MOVE AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN OUR EXPERIENCE 3 Scripture Reading: Eph 3:14-19; 4:4-6; 5:19-20; 6:10-11, 17; 1 John 4:2; 1 Peter 4:14; 2 Cor 13:14; Jude 20-21; 2 Thes 2:13-14; Rev 1:4-5; 22:1-2</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning portions in the New Testament revealing the Divine Trinity in the divine move and in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most of these portions are very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Ephesians 3 Paul speaks of the breadth, length, height, and depth of Christ v. 18 . Our fellowship here concerning the Divine Trinity is in the direction of His depth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>EPHESIANS 3:14-19</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 3:14-19 reveals the apostle praying to the Father; the Father strengthening the believers through the Spirit; Christ making His home in the believers' hearts; and the believers' being rooted and grounded in love, apprehending the dimensions of Christ, and knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ to be filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Ephesians 1 Paul prayed that God would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation that we might know Him and His economy v. 17 . He prayed that we would have the ability, the power, to see the spiritual revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter one his prayer is for our seeing the vision, but in chapter three his prayer is for our experience of the depths of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, Paul prayed to the Father as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the Father strengthens the believers through the Spirit as the means, the channel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then Christ moves and works to make His home in the believers' hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, the issue of the moving of the Father and the Spirit, and of the Son making His home in our hearts is the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father is the source, the Spirit is the means, the Son is the object, and the fullness of the Triune God is the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The source is the Father, the means is the Spirit, and the aim, the goal, is the Son because the Son is the center.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever the Triune God does is for the Son as the center, out of the Father as the source, and through the Spirit as the means.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul prayed to the Father as the source, asking the Father to strengthen the believers through the channel of the Spirit that a goal might be reached.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The goal was that Christ would make His home in the hearts of the believers.</S>
