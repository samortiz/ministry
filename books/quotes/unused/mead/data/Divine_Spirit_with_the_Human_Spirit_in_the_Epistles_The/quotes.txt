[1]  The Divine Spirit with the Human Spirit in the Epistles CONTENTS
[2]  Christ in the Gospels Becoming the All-inclusive Life-giving Spirit in the Acts and the Epistles
[3]  Enjoying God, Reigning in Life, Walking in Newness of Life, and Serving in Newness of Spirit
[4]  The Justifying, Speaking, and Guarding Spirit in 1 and 2 Timothy, the Renewing Spirit in Titus, and the Spirit of Grace in Philemon
[5]  IN THE ACTS AND THE EPISTLES Scripture Reading: John 1:1; 4:24; 1:14, 29; 10:10; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 6:17
[6]  Now, according to who Christ is, we must say that Christ is both God and man, but according to what Christ is, He is both Spirit and flesh.
[7]  Then God as Spirit became a man to die on the cross to bear our sins and accomplish redemption.
[8]  IN ROMANS Scripture Reading: Rom 1:1, 3-4; 5:10-11, 17; 6:4; 7:6; 8:2, 4-6, 9-10, 14-16, 23, 26-30; 12:11; 14:17
[9]  As we have seen, the four Gospels present Christ as the Head, and the Acts shows us the spreading of the Head, which is His Body, the church composed of many members.
[10]  According to the book of Romans, the Spirit of life is doing a fourfold work within us, a work of four aspects.
[11]  First, the Spirit of life liberates us; that is, He sets us free.
[12]  Romans 8:2 says, The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.
[13]  First, this Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God v. 16 . Even when we are fallen and backsliding, the Spirit within us always tells us that we are a child of God.
[14]  AND SERVING IN NEWNESS OF SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10-11, 17; 9:5; 6:4; 7:6, 25; 8:2, 4, 16; 12:2, 11; 14:17 ENJOYING GOD AND BOASTING IN HIM
[15]  Romans 5:10-11 says, If we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled, and not only so, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
[16]  To boast in God is to glory in God and enjoy God.
[17]  The redeeming Christ today is within us as the life-giving Spirit.
[18]  On the cross He was the redeeming Lamb of God, and now in our spirit He is the life-giving Spirit.
[19]  The Lamb is for redemption, and the Spirit is for life.
[20]  The key point of the Christian life is that Christ is in our spirit and that this wonderful Christ is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.
[21]  Romans 12:11 says, Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.
[22]  What we need is not to do many things but rather to be burning in spirit.
[23]  IN 1 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:1-2, 9, 5-7, 22-24, 30; 2:2, 9-16; 3:1-3, 7-13a, 16-17; 6:17, 19; 7:10, 12a, 25, 40; 10:1-4; 12:3-4, 7-13; 15:45b
[24]  It is not easy for many Christians to receive the proper light concerning the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians.
[25]  Even though the apostle presents the Spirit in a particular way, many today are too impressed with the supernatural gifts of the Spirit.
[26]  Verses 1 and 2 of chapter 1 say, Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours.
[27]  We need to experience this Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit, because it is the Spirit that searches the things of Christ, knows the things of Christ, and reveals, teaches, and discerns the things of Christ.
[28]  First Corinthians 3:1-3 says, And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.
[29]  First Corinthians 7:10 says, To the married I charge, not I but the Lord, A wife must not be separated from her husband.
[30]  IN 2 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:21-22; 3:3, 6, 8, 17, 18; 4:7, 16; 5:5; 12:8-9; 13:14
[31]  In the book of Romans, the Spirit is the Spirit of life, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the Son of God for our sonship to make us the real sons of God so that Christ may be the Firstborn among many brothers.
[32]  These many sons of God and brothers of Christ are the living members that form the Body of Christ as His corporate expression.
[33]  Then in 1 Corinthians, the Spirit is the indwelling Spirit who reveals to us all the things of Christ to bring us into the enjoyment, the fellowship, of all His riches, and through this enjoyment He builds us up together as one Body.
[34]  The pledge is the proof, guarantee, and down payment that all that God is, is our portion.
[35]  The seal means that we belong to God, and the pledge guarantees that God belongs to us.
[36]  The seal declares that we are God s, and the pledge declares that God is ours.
[37]  The Holy Spirit within us today is the firstfruit and foretaste of our enjoyment of Him, guaranteeing that God will give us the full enjoyment.
[38]  Therefore, for the Spirit to write Christ on us as living letters means that He writes Christ into our mind, emotion, and will; that is, the Spirit takes our whole heart as the tablet for inscribing Christ.
[39]  Verse 18 says, But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[40]  In addition to showing us that God s intention, desire, and pleasure are to reveal Christ in us, have Christ living in us, have Christ formed in us, and clothe us with Christ, the book of Galatians speaks much concerning the Spirit.
[41]  Galatians 4:4-5 says, When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under law, that He might redeem those under law that we might receive the sonship.
[42]  Verse 5 does not say that God sent forth His Son to redeem us so that we may go to heaven.
[43]  The way we know that the Spirit of the Son of God has been sent into us is that there is a cry within us.
[44]  Verse 8 says, For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.
[45]  We must not only walk in the Spirit but also sow unto the Spirit.
[46]  Then we will have something of the Spirit to reap as a harvest.
[47]  Therefore, we need to walk by the Spirit, live in the Spirit, sow unto the Spirit, and do everything in the Spirit for God s pleasure.
[48]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT IN EPHESIANS Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3, 13-14, 17-23; 3:3-5; 2:18, 22; 3:16-17a; 4:3-4, 23; 5:18; 6:17-18
[49]  The two main subjects of the New Testament Christ as life and the church as Christ s expression can be seen in the two books of Galatians and Ephesians.
[50]  Galatians tells us that Christ is our life, and in Ephesians we see the church as the Body of Christ.
[51]  In Galatians the Spirit is for us to take Christ as our life, live by Christ, and live out Christ.
[52]  Then in Ephesians the Spirit is for us, as the members of Christ, to realize and experience the Body.
[53]  As the introduction to the book of Ephesians, 1:3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.
[54]  Ephesians 3:3-4 says, By revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written previously in brief, by which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding inthe mystery of Christ.
[55]  In Colossians 2:2 the mystery of God is Christ, who is the story of God, the explanation and expression of God.
[56]  To see the mystery of Christ, which is the Body of Christ, requires a revelation in our spirit by the Holy Spirit.
[57]  The next aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit is that He renews all the parts of our soul our mind, emotion, and will.
[58]  Verse 23 of chapter 4 says, And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.
[59]  As our inner man is strengthened and the Spirit gains the opportunity to spread into all the parts of our soul, He becomes the renewing Spirit.
[60]  Originally, the Spirit was only in our spirit, but after strengthening our spirit, He spreads into our mind, which is the leading part of the soul and of the heart.
[61]  He is the revealing Spirit, the uniting Spirit, the building Spirit, the strengthening Spirit, the renewing Spirit, the filling Spirit, the slaying Spirit, and the praying Spirit.
[62]  In the book of Galatians the Spirit is for us to take Christ as our life and live Him, and in Ephesians the Spirit is for the Body life.
[63]  Romans 8:9 says, You are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.
[64]  Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.
[65]  This verse speaks of the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ.
[66]  To be poor or to be rich, to be persecuted or to be honored, are all the same to us if we have learned the secret of remaining in any state in order to magnify Christ by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[67]  Verse 3 of chapter 3 says, We are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.
[68]  As we have seen, we need to experience Christ in four aspects.
[69]  In whatever happens to us, we must remember that within us there is the all-inclusive Spirit supplying us all the time.
[70]  IN 1 AND 2 THESSALONIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:5-6, 8; 4:8; 5:19; 2 Thes 2:13; 1Thes.
[71]  First Thessalonians 1:5 and 6 say, Our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, even as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.
[72]  These verses indicate that the preaching of the gospel must be in the Holy Spirit, and the receiving of the gospel must be also in the Holy Spirit.
[73]  to Make Man Holy by God Coming into Him
[74]  The principle of incarnation is that God comes into man to mingle Himself with man.
[75]  By incarnation the Holy Spirit, the holy One, comes into man, the common one, to make man holy.
[76]  To those who preach, the Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus for suffering in the work, but to those who receive our preaching, He is the Holy Spirit bringing the gospel to them and bringing God into them.
[77]  The Lord opened our eyes to see that there is a third aspect of sanctification, which is to be saturated with God s divine element and substance.
[78]  We may illustrate this with a glass of water.
[79]  First Thessalonians 5:19 says, Do not quench the Spirit.
[80]  As we cooperate with the sanctifying Spirit and do not quench Him, day by day and hour by hour we will spontaneously be freed from every kind of sin and be separated from the world and all things other than God.
[81]  In the same principle, whenever we are not doing things in a way that expresses God, the Spirit condemns, but when we exercise ourselves unto godliness to walk and live in a way that expresses God, the Spirit justifies, vindicates, that we have godliness.
[82]  First Timothy 4:1 says, The Spirit says expressly that in later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons by means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, of men who are branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron.
[83]  Here Paul does not say the Holy Spirit ; he simply says the Spirit.
[84]  Many times in the New Testament this term denotes not only the Spirit Himself but the Spirit mingled with our human spirit.
[85]  Titus 3:5-7 says, Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, in order that having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
[86]  God has given us the Spirit, the holy One, and has poured out this Spirit upon us with the purpose that we may be heirs of the eternal life according to our hope, that is, that we may enjoy the eternal life as our inheritance.
[87]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE ETERNAL, TESTIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, AND ANOINTING SPIRIT IN HEBREWS Scripture Reading: Heb 9:14, 12, 15; 5:9; 3:7-8; 9:6-8; 10:15; 1:1-2a; 2:4; 10:29; 4:16; 6:4; 1:9; 12:9, 23; 4:12; 10:19
[88]  The book of Hebrews tells us that Christ is superior to Judaism and everything related to it.
[89]  However, if we read this book carefully in the spirit, we will realize that it also deals with the indwelling Spirit.
[90]  It is not a book of doctrinal teaching; rather, it is a book of experience in our spirit through the Holy Spirit.
[91]  This verse says, How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
[92]  We have already considered several titles of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament: the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the life-giving Spirit.
[93]  Verses 6 and 7 of chapter 9 say, Now these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle the priests enter continually, accomplishing their worship; but into the second, only the high priest enters, once a year and not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people.
[94]  If we are in the spirit while we read concerning the things of the tabernacle, the Holy Spirit, the eternal Spirit who is not restricted by time or space, will speak to us and point out to us the real significance of these things.
[95]  Verse 9 of chapter 1 says, You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners.
[96]  The Lord Jesus was anointed with the oil of the eternal Spirit.
[97]  Because God poured out the Spirit of exultant joy upon Him, He could offer Himself to God by this eternal Spirit.
[98]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE ENVYING SPIRIT, THE SPIRIT OF GLORY, THE PROPHESYING SPIRIT,
[99]  Concerning idols, Exodus 20:5 says, You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them; for I, Jehovah your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me. Because God is a jealous God, we should worship only Him and not divide our worship between Him and anyone else.
[100]  Verses10 and 11 of chapter 1 say, Concerning this salvation the prophets, who prophesied concerning the grace that was to come unto you, sought and searched diligently, searching into what time or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them was making clear, testifying beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these.
[101]  The prophecies concerning Christ were made by the Spirit of Christ in the prophets of the Old Testament dispensation.
[102]  Even before Christ came, His Spirit in the Old Testament was with the prophets who diligently did their best to seek out, to search, and to know what would happen to Christ.
[103]  The Spirit of glory within us today gives us the understanding that if we suffer with Christ, we will also be glorified with Him.
[104]  Verse 21 of chapter 1 says, No prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God while being borne by the Holy Spirit.
[105]  As they were carried along by the Holy Spirit, the prophets spoke from God.
[106]  In 1 Corinthians He is the building Spirit, and in 2 Corinthians He is the transforming Spirit.
[107]  In 1 and 2 Thessalonians He is the sanctifying Spirit, in 1 and 2 Timothy He is the Spirit for our exercise unto godliness, and in Titus He is the renewing Spirit.
[108]  The Lord speaks in the Spirit, through the Spirit, and with the Spirit, because He is the Spirit.
[109]  Verse 6 of chapter 22 says, He said to me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show to His slaves the things which must quickly take place.
[110]  In summary, Revelation tells us that the Spirit of God today is the seven Spirits of God for God s administration in judgment, that the Lord is one with this Spirit in speaking to and dealing with His church, that the Spirit is one with the completed church as the bride, that the Lord is the God of the spirits of the prophets, and that in order to see the heavenly visions we need to be in our spirit.
