   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE LAW Date: November 20, 1935, morning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Chuenchow</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As believers, we live by the Holy Spirit, not by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people do not know what the law is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result, they do not know the Holy Spirit either.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not know what it means to live by the law and what it means to live by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The failure in our work is due to the fact that we work by the law and not by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we trust in the law, we will not have the power or the fruit because the law is something that the Lord has judged.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>WHAT IS THE LAW?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The law is not just the Ten Commandments or the few hundred ordinances of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are the Old Testament laws, but there are also New Testament laws.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Israelites in the Old Testament had their laws, and the church in the New Testament also has its laws.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the principle of the law?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God has a will, and this will is written down on tablets of stone or on paper, including anything from one item to a thousand items of ordinances, we have the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By walking according to these hundreds and thousands of items of the law, a man becomes clear what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also becomes clear concerning the way he should take.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once a man begins to walk according to this dead law, he can put God aside and ignore Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is like saying that a student can ignore the principal of his school as long as he abides by the school rules.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Good and evil, right and wrong, are known through the written code.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The path that one has to follow comes entirely from his knowledge and not from the inner leading of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When this happens we have the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people can tell the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, without ever fellowshipping with God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This knowledge, however, is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who live this way are still living under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you measure everything according to this rule, you will find that many things are still under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man is naturally inclined to the law because he can easily tell from the law what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most people are afraid of living by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They would rather live according to some prescribed rules.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Keeping the law is both legal and dead, but it is also something convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One can know how many laws he has kept and which ones he has come short of.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The law turns man away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With the law, man does not need to contact God; he can put Him aside.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After you have passed the gate of victory, you should no longer live under the law, but live by the Spirit Rom 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>LIVING UNDER THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let us consider the meaning of walking according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I did not know what it meant to live according to the law until a few years ago, that is, until 1928.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I had been a preacher for many years, but I did not know what it meant to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is true that I could explain the law to others according to my theological knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But in my practical experience I never understood this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was a time when I was gravely ill.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord healed me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After I was healed, I rested and recuperated by the seaside.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There I met Brother Simon Meek and stayed with him for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His health was not good either, and he wanted me to give him some advice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I asked, "What do you want me to help you with?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He answered, "Please tell me if it is scriptural to ask for healing."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I said, "God does heal people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But Timothy had to use some wine, and Epaphroditus was not healed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul's eyes were not good and could not read small handwriting."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I went on to tell him the experience of many people who were healed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brother Simon Meek said, "Your answer is no answer at all."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At that time, I realized what the law is.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the Bible tells us what to do step by step, all we have to do is to act accordingly in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, God wants direct fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He wants us to receive His revelation and then act according to His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do not fellowship with Him, the Spirit will have no outlet for His work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Man likes to have clear instructions from the Bible concerning everything he does.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, in the matter of divine healing, he wants a clear yes or no from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However the Bible shows us that some sicknesses were healed and some sicknesses were not healed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Bible does not have any rule regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God has no intention for the church to hold on to some dead letters and forsake Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He wants to see men seeking, praying, and waiting quietly on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He does not want us to have any trust in something apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The law speaks of God's past will; it is not God's present will.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, man always wants to know God's present will according to His past will.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God wants man to fellowship with Him and understand His present desire through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He does not want us to merely keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is why we need to have fresh fellowship with God every day.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Only then we can know His will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The second aspect of the law is that it dictates how we should live.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God does not want to decide how the church should live from day to day.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He wants the church to fellowship with Him moment by moment so that the church can know His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If I prescribe everything that one of my employees should do and the way he should live, he can abide by my prescriptions for a day, a week, or even a month without fellowshipping with me or asking me anything.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the principle of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The law is doing God's will without communicating with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When I was in Shanghai, I had a servant who also was a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>One day I considered how the Lord wants us to exercise our spirit and not follow the law when working for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I wanted to see if it would work if I were to deal with my servant by the Spirit and not by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is convenient to lay down laws in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If I laid down some laws, it would be easy for my servant to work for me.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Of course I have to abide by the same laws as well.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I began to talk with my servant and told him that he should check with me in everything and not make any proposals of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Neither would I give him any prescribed rules.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>While I was talking with a friend, the servant came in a few times and asked each time, "What do you want to eat?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What do you want to drink?"</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I said, "Just wait a while."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Later, the servant confessed that it was easier to work according to some laws than to ask for instructions in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>From this we see that it is easy to keep the law, but it is not easy to work according to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Easy or hard, however, this is God's desire, and we cannot take the easy way.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We have to take the God-ordained way, which is not being under the law but under the Spirit.</S>
