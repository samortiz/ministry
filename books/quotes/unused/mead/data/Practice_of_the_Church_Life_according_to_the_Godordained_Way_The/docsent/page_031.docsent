   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Manifesting the Believers' Spiritual Function</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Enrich the Church's Service</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in the Lord's Economy</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaking manifests the believers' spiritual function to enrich the church's service in the Lord's economy 1 Cor 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without the believers' speaking, there is no way to enrich the church's service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the saints do not speak, the riches of the Body of Christ will not be manifested and used.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the poor, degraded practice of Christianity, all the functions of the believers are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But among us in the Lord's recovery, the believers' spiritual function should be manifested to enrich the church's service in the Lord's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some would say that they are not like other brothers who have been manifested to be very useful in the church's service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, they may feel that they are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, they do not like to become manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, it is better for everyone to be manifested, whether they seem to be useful or not.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When someone is manifested to be somewhat weak, this will cause the perfecting ones to spend more time on this one in order to make him useful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the full-time training, we are doing this kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are laboring to transform the weak speakings into wonderful speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the trainees come and speak, making all kinds of mistakes, their weaknesses are manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we know what kind of medicine to prescribe for them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, the trainees will go back to their respective churches as different people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When they stand to speak, the whole church will receive the benefit of their function.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have a concern for all of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The trainees should go back to their churches in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They should not go back to direct the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They should not have the attitude that the church should listen to them and do what they feel to do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That kind of behavior would be ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They should not go back claiming or proclaiming anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They should simply attend the church meetings and at the right time stand up and speak a word for the benefit of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. Building Edifying the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>in Life and in Truth</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Practicing to prophesy is for building edifying the believers in life and in truth 1 Cor 14:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every kind of speaking should have some amount of life and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Silence ministers nothing of life and truth to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if you speak something for the Lord, by the Lord, in the Lord, and with the Lord, there will surely be something of life and truth in what you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This edifies the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>E. Building Them Up</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>into the Body of Christ, the Church</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Prophesying builds the believers up into the Body of Christ, the church 1 Cor 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On a building site, there may be many pieces of material lying around, which may be close to the building but have not been built up into the building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have never spoken in the church meetings, you have never been practically built up into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more you speak properly for the Lord, the more you are built up into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>F. Keeping the Believers to Live in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>and to Not Be Detached from the Body</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By speaking we are built up into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By speaking we are also kept so that we can live in the Body and not be detached from the Body Eph 4:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many saints among us are detached.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As long as you do not speak, you are detached.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many have never been attached because they have never spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why you should exercise to speak for the Lord.</S>
