In the spring of 1937 Watchman Nee delivered a series of twenty-six messages on the basic truths of the gospel of God to the church in Shanghai, China. These messages compose the contents of this two-volume set. The matters covered are comprehensive, ranging from man's sinful condition before salvation to his destiny in the coming age. In the first volume, Watchman Nee presents the particulars of God's salvation, that is, man's sins; God's love, grace, and mercy; the nature of grace; the function of the law and God's righteousness; the work of Christ and of the Holy Spirit in God's salvation; and faith as the way of salvation. In the second volume, he covers in detail the issues of eternal security of salvation and God's way of dealing with the believer's sins both in this age and in the age to come. For both issues Watchman Nee presents persuasive reponses from the Scriptures to various understandings current among Christians.</P><P>The messages in this series were spoken by Watchman Nee in Chinese and were transcribed by hand as they were being given. The handwritten notes have been translated into English and edited as necessary. As much as possible, the spoken nature of the messages has been preserved. Many of the illustrations Brother Nee used were drawn from his life in China at the time.</P><P>These messages demonstrate the Lord's commission to our brother and His equipping of him with the revelation in His Word. May the Lord richly bless all who read and see these truths released by the Lord through our brother.</P><P>The Editor</P></td></tr></table></div>
