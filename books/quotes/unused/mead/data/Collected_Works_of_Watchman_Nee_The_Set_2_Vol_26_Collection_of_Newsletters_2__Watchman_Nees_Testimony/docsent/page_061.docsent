   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ISSUE NO.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>12 July 1935 AN OPEN LETTER FROM THOSE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PUBLICATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To the brothers who are of the same mind in all localities:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our intention when first publishing Collection of News- letters was that through this little publication the brothers in all the localities might be able to share their news with each other and that the assemblies in various places might be able to fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We had also hoped to obtain more news concerning the personal spiritual experiences of the brothers and sisters so that all the saints in different localities could be mutually edified in their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our work is spiritual, and our emphasis is life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This has already been pointed out in "The Origin" in the first issue and in "A Letter about This Publication and the Co-workers" in the ninth issue.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was also pointed out in "Some Words from the Responsible Brothers" in the tenth issue.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, although this was our intention and hope, the letters which we received from the saints have for the most part not paid attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And even we ourselves have not held firm to our purpose in the way we have edited the material.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Articles in the past have mostly dealt with outward matters such as baptism, leaving the denominations, etc. Thus, it seems that this paper has become a special publication on leaving the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is now clear to us that since this is the case, we have not only failed to achieve the objective of this publication, but have also fallen short of our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers, we have deviated from the Lord's heart in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can therefore only seek the grace of God and hope for a change.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have pointed out before that "our work is spiritual and that our emphasis is life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are clear that God wants us to manifest the life of Christ in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the reality of our work is the life of Christ, and the outward expression of our work is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this present time, when the outward church is desolate, we do not have the slightest intention to start a new movement,' group,' organization,' or denomination.'</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We dare not even call ourselves the churches in the various places.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We stand only on the position of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"What is our center?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is our work to preach Christ as Lord or to preach leaving the denominations?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am really fearful that in every locality there are brothers who, being limited in understanding and spiritual experience before God, only have a little knowledge about outward matters such as baptism, head covering, and denominations, and exhaust their effort to publicize these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By doing so, they cause outsiders to misunderstand us, thinking that we only emphasize these outward things and that we do not exalt Jesus Christ as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know that if anyone follows the Lord, he will certainly take care of these outward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But it does not mean that anyone who practices these outward things is necessarily following the Lord completely.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must emphasize again and again for the sake of the ignorant brothers among us that although we believe in these outward matters, yet our testimony, that which makes us different from others, is not in these outward things."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>See Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>9 and 10 of this publication.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have, therefore, decided that after this issue we shall no longer publish this paper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We hope our decision will seem good to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hereafter may we pay more attention to the inward testimony than to the outward matters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not to say that we are neglecting the outward matters but that we should not overemphasize them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We admit they have their place, but they are neither our center nor our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can only ask God's forgiveness and the brothers' forbearance for the past failure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May the Lord cause us to pay attention to what is important to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord bless you all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Peace be with you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Watchman Nee</S>
