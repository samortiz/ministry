   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>7 WHAT ARE WE?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They said then to him, Who are you,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>that we may give an answer to those who sent us?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What do you say about yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1:22 Therefore I will be ready always to remind you</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>concerning these things, even though you know them and have been established in the present truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2 Peter 1:12 Scripture Reading:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John 1:22; 2 Peter 1:12</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today we will look at one question: what are we?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What are we doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the past we have not said much about this matter because it is somewhat awkward to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason we have been reluctant to speak about ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, though we have not mentioned the matter, others have often asked us, What are you?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some have even said that we are the Revival Church, or the Little Flock Church, or The Christian Editor s note: Watchman Nee published a magazine, The Christian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, we would like to say a few words concerning this question.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, we must clarify that we are not some thing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not a new denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Neither are we a new sect, a new movement, or a new organization.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not here to join a certain sect or form our own sect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Other than having a special calling and commission from God, there would be no need for us to exist independently.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason we are here is that God has given us a special calling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>ESTABLISHED IN THE PRESENT TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second Peter 1:12 mentions the words established in the present truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The present truth can also be rendered the up-to-date truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the up-to-date truth?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, all the truths are in the Bible; there is not one truth that is not in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although they are all in the Bible, through man s foolishness, unfaithfulness, negligence, and disobedience many of the truths were lost and hidden from man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The truths were there, but man did not see them or touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not until the fullness of time did God release certain truths during particular periods of time and cause them to be revealed once more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These freshly revealed truths are not God s new inventions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, they are man s new discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no need for invention, but there is the need for discovery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In past generations God revealed different truths.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During certain periods of time, He caused men to discover these specific truths.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can see this clearly from the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Take, for example, the raising up of Martin Luther in the sixteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God opened his eyes to see the matter of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was a vessel raised up by God to unveil the truth of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does not mean that before Luther there was no such thing as justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fact already existed before Luther s time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Luther was merely the one who realized this truth in a stronger way; he was particularly outstanding in this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason, this truth became the present truth in that age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every worker of the Lord should inquire before God as to what the present truth is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to ask: God, what is the present truth?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although there are many major and crucial truths in the Bible, what we need to know is God s present truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only do we need to know the general truths, we must also be clear about God s present truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>TRUTH RECOVERED</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>DURING THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From the sixteenth century on, God has been recovering different truths.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The sixteenth century was the age of the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was a time of monumental change in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This does not mean that before the sixteenth century there was no recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There were recoveries before that time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, it was from the sixteenth century on that there were significant recoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to consider the history from the time of the Reformation as belonging to four periods.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first period is the period of the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The second period is the time immediately after the Reformation, from the sixteenth century to the eighteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The third period is the nineteenth century, and the last period is the present twentieth century.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First, let us consider Luther s Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When Luther was raised up by God, he saw the light and proposed that man go back to the truth in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today many people evaluate Luther s work from the political angle and consider it to be a political movement.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, having read Luther s diaries, writings, and books, I see that his motives and goals were right.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The best thing about him was his recovery of the truth of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is Luther s particular recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Of course, God did not recover all the truths through Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Luther recovered only the truth concerning justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He did not make complete changes with regard to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, he still recognized the state church and approved of the church being part of the state.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He did not receive light regarding this point.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For this reason, not long after, the Lutheran denomination became the state religion of Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Luther himself once said that the church should not be controlled by the state.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet he considered administrative questions transitional, temporal, and of the outer court, and not matters that belong to the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, he was not thorough in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God allowed the question of church administration to be left unsolved at Luther s time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although this matter was not successfully recovered, the truth of justification by faith was definitely recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God dug up this buried truth from all the traditions, human opinions, and creeds and caused this truth to be known and preached once more.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If a person were born in that age, what he should have done was preach this truth and exhort others concerning this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If he did not do this, he should not be considered a faithful worker of God in that age.</S>
