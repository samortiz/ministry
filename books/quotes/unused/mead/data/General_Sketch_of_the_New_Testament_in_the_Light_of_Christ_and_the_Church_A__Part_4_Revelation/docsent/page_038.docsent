   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE THE NEW JERUSALEM 2 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:12-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we shall consider further aspects of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Her Structure and Measurement</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 21:12-13 says, It had a great and high wall and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel: on the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Having the Four Directions</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>of the Dwelling Place of God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>East, north, south, and west is the spiritual order of the directions of the tabernacle, conveying the thought of God s dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The four directions of the tabernacle begin from the east, the direction the entrance faced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When someone would come into the tabernacle, he would enter from the east.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then from the east he would turn to the table of the bread of the Presence on the north, the lampstand on the south, and the incense altar toward the west.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then to the rear of the incense altar was the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the writing of the holy Scriptures, the Holy Spirit was very careful to record the details in Revelation 21, showing that the holy city is the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>East, north, south, and west are the directions of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Having Three Gates on Four Sides</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>in a Balanced Way</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That the city of New Jerusalem has four sides, each side with three gates, indicates that it is in the center of the universe, and it is the very center itself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If, for example, someone puts a building in the corner of a lot, it can have gates only on two of its sides because the other two sides do not face onto the property.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For a building to have gates on four sides, each opening onto the lot in balanced proportions, it must be in the center.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In my lifetime I have come in contact with many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I can testify under the covering of the Lord s blood that I have never met a person so balanced in so many directions as Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was one of many reasons why I was willing to submit myself to him, even though he was only two years older than I. His balance was a great help to us and to the churches in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By the mercy of the Lord, the churches in the Far East have always been balanced in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A few times in recent years some believers who attended our meetings told us that we are like the holiness churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, others came and said that we are like the Baptists, the Presbyterians, and the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When someone asks us if we are Brethren, we say, Yes, in a sense, but not in every sense.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Still others thought we are Pentecostals.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is difficult to say what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are nothing, yet we seem to have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must not denominate ourselves, and if we are balanced in every way, it will not be easy for others to denominate us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Jerusalem has twelve gates on four sides, not only one gate on one side.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should never build in the corner of the lot.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must never go to any extreme or take our stand in a corner.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If someone pulls us to one side, we should lean toward the other side as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not be a cake not turned Hosea 7:8 , with one side burned and the other raw.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, to be in the center is not to be neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The best way to be great is to compromise by staying neutral, but we should be holy not great.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are part not of the great city, Babylon, but of the holy city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, on the one hand, we must be absolute and uncompromising, but on the other hand, we must be balanced.</S>
