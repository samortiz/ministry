   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AND THE NEW LIFE CHAPTER NINE FORGIVENESS OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In accomplishing His work in man, God does not deal with individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He includes the whole of humanity in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whatever He executes in Christ is carried out in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The doctrine of salvation is found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God also gives man a new life in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has no desire to change our outward behavior; He only wants to change our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His one intention is to replace our old life with a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He can only accomplish this in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we are in Christ, this work of replacement is automatically applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A FEW PREREQUISITES</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, before God can dispense a new life to us, some matters need to be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If these things are not settled, God can never give life to us, and we will never have the right to receive anything from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know that the most crucial matter in the Christian faith is the possession of a new life from God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But there are a few prerequisites, without which it is impossible to partake of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, these items occupy an important position and rightly demand our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>FORGIVENESS OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first item is the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This provides God with a proper standing to dispense life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all know that the manifested behavior of our natural life is extremely evil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is hopeless beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our corrupt behavior is made known by the sins we commit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some commit rash and ugly sins, while others indulge in more refined and subtle ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In either case, all these sins have to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have to be forgiven justly and properly before we can receive the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE SOLUTION TO THE OLD LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, the very life which activates sins must be dealt with thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Unless this life is removed from its root, the possibility of sin remains; it will continue to bear corrupt fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin will still be manifested in our thoughts and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God must give a final solution to our old life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It must be terminated once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After these two things are taken care of, God can freely dispense a new life to us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we can walk according to it day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will also be able to live a God-like life on earth and fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TO REPENT IS NOT ENOUGH</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How does God forgive our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people have an erroneous concept concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They think that although they have committed many sins, the sins can all be pardoned if they repent of their evil conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But repentance can never remit a sin that you have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No matter how much you repent, your sins are still there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may regret your sins as much as you want, but they will not be removed simply by your repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I was preaching in Kaifeng, some government officials were present.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I told them, suppose a bandit committed many crimes and murdered many, but was not caught for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then one day he appeared before you, saying, "I repent of all my past misconduct.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From now on I am going to reform.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have determined to be a law-abiding citizen and a good man."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Please tell me, would his repentance annul his former crimes, the cases brought up against him by his victims, and the prosecutions conducted against him by the law?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Would they be nullified?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Would the law let him go?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD MUST BE MAINTAINED</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible shows us that all sins incur certain kinds of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nothing we do is lightly passed over.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The outward manifestation of our life is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not only do we sin against ourselves, but we sin against others and, above all, against God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He cannot evasively bypass our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His righteousness does not permit Him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I remember a true story.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once a man murdered someone and stole a sum of money.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He then took refuge in another town.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There he married and had some children.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The people in that place knew nothing of his past.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One day, three detectives came to look for him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They found the man and were about to take him away.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The man turned to his wife and asked, "For all these years that I have been with you, have I not been a good husband?"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The wife agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then he turned to his children, saying, "Am I not a good father to you?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The children also nodded.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Finally he turned to his neighbors: "In all these years, have I ever intruded upon your property or done any wrong to you?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Would you not consider me a good neighbor?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They all consented unanimously that he was a fine person.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He then turned around to the three detectives and defended himself, saying, "See, I have been a good man all these years.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Here are all these witnesses testifying to my goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You should let me go!"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The three replied, "You may be justified before everybody, but you are not justified before the law.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Your repentance may guarantee your future innocence, but it can never remove your past guilt, nor can it deliver you from the judgment of the law."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the end, he had to face his trial in court.</S>
