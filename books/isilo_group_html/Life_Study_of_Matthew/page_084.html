Praying That God&rsquo;s Will May Be Done on Earth</h2><p>Verse 10 also says, &ldquo;Let Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.&rdquo; Following the rebellion of Satan (Ezek. 28:17; Isa. 14:13-15), the earth fell into the usurping hand of Satan. Thus, the will of God could not be done on earth as in heaven. Hence, God created man with the intention of recovering the earth for Himself (Gen. 1:26-28). After the fall of man, Christ came to bring the heavenly rule to earth so that the earth might be recovered for God&rsquo;s right, that the will of God might be done on earth as in heaven. This is the purpose of the new King establishing the kingdom of the heavens with His followers. The kingdom people must pray for this until the earth is fully recovered for God&rsquo;s will in the coming kingdom age.</p><p>When the Father&rsquo;s name is sanctified, the Son&rsquo;s kingdom has come, and the Spirit&rsquo;s will is done on earth as in heaven, that will be the time of the manifestation of the kingdom. But we who are in the reality of the kingdom today must pray for these things.</p><h2 class="head4">d. Praying That God May Give Us<br />Our Daily Food</h2><p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Give us today our daily bread.&rdquo; This prayer is all-inclusive. The patterned prayer firstly cares for God&rsquo;s name, God&rsquo;s kingdom, and God&rsquo;s will; then secondly, for our need. This reveals that in this fighting prayer the Lord will still take care of our needs. According to verse 11 we are to ask &ldquo;today&rdquo; for our &ldquo;daily bread.&rdquo; The King does not want His people to worry about tomorrow (v. 34); He only wants them to pray for their needs today. The term &ldquo;daily bread&rdquo; indicates living by faith. The kingdom people should not live on what they have stored; rather, by faith they should live on the Father&rsquo;s daily supply.</p><h2 class="head4">e. Praying That God May Forgive Us Our Sins</h2><p>Verse 12 says, &ldquo;And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.&rdquo; Thirdly, the patterned prayer cares for the kingdom people&rsquo;s failures before God and their relationship with others. They should ask the Father to forgive their debts, their failures, and their trespasses, as they forgive their debtors to maintain peace. Verse 12 indicates that in this fighting prayer we must admit and confess that we have shortcomings, mistakes, and wrongdoings. We are in debt to others. Hence, we must ask the Father to forgive us as we forgive others for the Father&rsquo;s sake.</p><h2 class="head4">f. Praying That God May Keep Us from Trial<br />and Deliver Us from the Evil One</h2><p>Verse 13 says, &ldquo;And do not bring us into trial, but deliver us from the evil one.&rdquo; Fourthly, the patterned prayer cares for the kingdom people in dealing with the evil one. They should ask the Father not to bring them into trial, but to deliver them from the evil one, Satan, the Devil. Remember, the King was led into temptation. The word &ldquo;trial&rdquo; in verse 13 actually means temptation. Sometimes the Father brings us into a situation where we are tried and tempted. Thus, as we pray to the Father, we must recognize our weakness and say, &ldquo;Father, I am very weak. Do not bring me into trial.&rdquo; This implies that you admit that you are weak. If you do not recognize your weakness, you will probably not pray in this manner. Rather, you may feel that you are strong. That will be the very time the Father will bring you into trial to show you that you are not strong at all. Thus, it is better for our prayer to indicate to the Father that we know our weakness. We should say, &ldquo;Father, I fully realize that I am weak. Please do not bring me into trial. There is no need for You to do that, Father, for I recognize my weakness.&rdquo; Never say to yourself, &ldquo;Whatever happens, I am confident I can stand.&rdquo; If that is your attitude, be prepared to be led into the wilderness to confront temptation. Instead of having such an attitude, pray that the Father would not bring you into trial, but that He would deliver you from the evil one.</p><h2 class="head4">g. Recognizing God&rsquo;s Kingdom, Power, and Glory</h2><p>According to this pattern of prayer, the kingdom people must recognize God&rsquo;s kingdom, power, and glory. Verse 13 also says, &ldquo;For Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. Amen.&rdquo; The kingdom is the realm for God to exercise His power that He may express His glory.</p><h2 class="head3">5. The Condition of Prayer&mdash;<br />to Forgive Others Their Offenses</h2><p>Verses 14 and 15 reveal that the condition of prayer is to forgive others their offenses. These verses say, &ldquo;For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses.&rdquo; &ldquo;For&rdquo; indicates that the word in verses 14 and 15 is an explanation of why the kingdom people must forgive their debtors (v. 12), If they do not forgive man&rsquo;s offenses, neither will their heavenly Father forgive their offenses; hence, their prayer will be frustrated.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Regarding Fasting</h2><p>In verses 16 through 18 the King speaks regarding fasting. Instead of appearing to men to fast, we should fast in secret. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;And whenever you fast, do not be as the hypocrites of a sad countenance; for they disguise their faces so that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.&rdquo; To fast is not to refrain from eating; it is being unable to eat because of being desperately burdened to pray for certain things. It is also an expression of self-humbling in seeking mercy of God. To give alms is to give what we have the right to possess, whereas to fast is to give up what we have the right to enjoy.</p><p>Verses 17 and 18 say, &ldquo;But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father Who is in secret; and your Father Who sees in secret shall repay you.&rdquo; This indicates that our fasting, like our giving of alms and praying, must be done in secret, not before men. The Father sees in secret, and He will repay us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_083.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_085.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Matthew &nbsp; pg 84</div><br></body></html>
