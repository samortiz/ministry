   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Man-child</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, just as the first man failed God, so this new man also failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first man was a failure; the second man was a success, but the new man again became a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last book of the Bible, Revelation, was written after the failure of the new man, that is, after the failure and degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This book was written for the purpose of calling the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the One who cares for the churches, Christ speaks as the Spirit to the many saints who have become degraded in order to call the overcomers to overcome the degraded situation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These overcomers eventually become a corporate entity which is called the man-child Rev 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>BEING UNVEILED TO SEE THE STRATEGIC POINTS OF THE BIBLE RELATED TO GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we have four titles: the first man, the second man, the new man, and the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please do not say that this is my teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, we should say, "This is the teaching of the Bible."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 15:45a speaks of the first man, saying, "So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul.'"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 47 mentions the second man: "The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then Ephesians 2:15 and 4:24 and Colossians 3:10-11 speak of the new man, who is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Finally, Revelation 12:5 speaks of the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may have been in Christianity for many years, but we never heard of the first man, the second man, the new man, and the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shows us the poverty of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These things are clearly revealed and unveiled in the Bible, but we may never have heard them in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a subtlety of the enemy, Satan, because these are the strategic points of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christianity has missed these strategic points and turned its attention to the minor, secondary things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yes, the Bible does tell the wives to submit to their own husband and the husbands to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the Bible is not a book of wives submitting or husbands loving.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not make the Bible such a book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That is your Bible; that is not God's Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible speaks of the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some may argue with me and say, "Isn't there a verse in the Bible telling wives to submit and husbands to love?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yes, there is, but there is also a verse that says, "Now the serpent was more crafty than every other animal of the field which Jehovah God had made" Gen 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you think, therefore, that the Bible is a Bible of the serpent?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not make the Bible a Bible of the subtle serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible also says that a donkey spoke in a human language Num 22:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While Balaam, the Gentile prophet, rode on a donkey, all of a sudden that donkey spoke in man's language.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet, do not make the Bible a Bible of a donkey's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible has many things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible has the serpent, the Bible has scorpions, and the Bible has the lake of fire, but the Bible is not a book of such things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is the Bible a book of the lake of fire?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is the Bible a book of scorpions?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is foolish, yet it is in this way that Christianity has erred.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christianity makes the Bible a book of many secondary, minor things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the Bible is a book of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's eternal purpose is not to have a wife submitting to her husband or a husband loving his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus tells us that in the resurrection there will be no more husband and wife Matt 22:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Again, do not argue with me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not my teaching; this is the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, do not follow the traditional teaching of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Come back to the pure Word and remove all your veils.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many teachings we received from Christianity, whether bad or good, right or wrong, sound or unhealthy, are veils over our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It took me more than fifteen years to take away all these veils.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once when I was in Manila, a dear one came to me and asked, "Brother Lee, why can you see so many wonderful things from the Bible and we cannot?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I told him that was because he had too many layers of veils.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Day by day we have the Bible, but we also have not only one layer but many layers of veils on our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have picked up many doctrines and teachings from our youth until today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some are good, and some are bad, but they all can become veils.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Lord Jesus came to the earth the first time, many publicans, sinners, and Gentiles came to Him, and when they did, they saw something.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Pharisees and priests, however, saw nothing of the Lord because they were veiled with their teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The teachings and doctrines they picked up from the Old Testament became their veils.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If I were to go to Mongolia, it would be easy to speak the things of the Lord to the people there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Regrettably, however, it is not as easy to speak in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Christians here are veiled, covered with all kinds of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we tell the Mongolians about the second man, they would learn and be glad to know that such a matter is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But in this country if I speak of the second man or the man-child, some may accuse me of coming from China with oriental philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is due to the veils of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible is not a book of many different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Bible is a book of the eternal purpose of God, which is for God to have a corporate man to express Him with His image and represent Him with His authority by man's taking Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The first man failed God in His purpose, but the Lord Jesus came as the second man and succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He died and rose again, and in His resurrection He was multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now we are the many grains blended together to be the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, the majority of the members of this new man failed God again, but the Lord came in to sound out a call, not the first calling but the second calling.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first calling was for our salvation, but now the second calling is for our overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is not merely to overcome our temper, our little sins, or our little bad habits; it is to overcome degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who overcome are the man-child, which eventually fulfills God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This man-child expresses God and represents God by God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This brief word is very simple, but it covers the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The entire Bible is under the span of these four men: the first man, the second man, the new man, and the man-child.</S>
