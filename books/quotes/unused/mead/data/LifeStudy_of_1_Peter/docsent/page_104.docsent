   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOBER AND WATCHFUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 8 Peter continues, Be sober; watch.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Your adversary, the Devil, as a roaring lion walks about, seeking someone to devour.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be sober is to have a clear mind of sobriety and self-control so that we may know, especially as disclosed in this chapter, God s purpose in disciplining us and His enemy s scheme to destroy us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not cast all our anxiety on the Lord, it will be difficult for us to be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many saints become confused because of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we hold on to our anxiety, our mind will not be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead of being sober, we may be under a thick cloud of confusion and have no sense of direction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If our mind is disturbed by anxiety, we cannot be sober.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our thinking will not be clear, but will be confused, mixed up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If our mind is in such a condition, it will be difficult for us to hear the Lord s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Anxiety may also cause us to speak in a nonsensical manner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, if we would be sober, we must cast our anxiety on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to what Peter says in 5:8, we also need to watch.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To watch is to be vigilant as in warfare, as soldiers on the frontier.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anxiety is a subtle enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many times anxiety is Satan s incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to be watchful and not allow anxiety to invade us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A country s defense requires watchfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those in the defense department are always watchful lest an enemy invade the country.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is also Peter s concept when he urges us to be sober and watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter wrote verse 8 according to his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter may have been lacking in schooling, but he was rich in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he was a young man, he was called by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the Lord s resurrection, Peter learned much in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before the resurrection of Christ, Peter had heard and seen many things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, he did not have the proper interpretation and understanding of those things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But after the Lord s resurrection, the Spirit came to be within Peter and upon him, and he began to understand what he had experienced during the three and a half years he was with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peter, therefore, was a man full of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His writings are based not merely on doctrine, but also on experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of his experience Peter could charge the saints to be sober and watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we have indicated, the word watch implies fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are involved in a warfare, and we need to be vigilant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not let the enemy come in. Anxiety is a subtle enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Often the Devil is concealed within anxiety or lurks behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you welcome anxiety, you will welcome Satan, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, you need to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus also charged His disciples to watch and pray Matt 26:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to watch, to be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>OUR ADVERSARY, THE DEVIL</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason we need to be watchful is that our adversary, the Devil, as a roaring lion walks about, seeking someone to devour.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Literally, the word adversary in Greek means an opponent in a lawsuit .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here this word refers to Satan, who is our accuser Rev 12:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Greek word for Devil, diabolos, means accuser, slanderer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Devil, who is Satan, accuses us before God and slanders us before men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Devil, the adversary, in verse 8 is related to the anxiety in verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we give way to anxiety, we shall also give way to the adversary, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may even say that the anxiety in verse 7 is the adversary in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An adversary is different from an enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>An enemy is an opponent who is objective to us, outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>An adversary is a subjective opponent, an opponent within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Satan is not only the enemy outside of us; he is also the adversary within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Anxiety is a form of the Devil as our adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we are anxious or worried, we should say, Satan, you are exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This anxiety is really you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Don t cover yourself with a cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I know who you are.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not anxiety this is you, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Satan, get away from me!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to the context, anxiety is actually the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Devil comes to us to attack under the cloak of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He pretends to be anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we need to be watchful, vigilant.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A ROARING LION SEEKING SOMEONE TO DEVOUR</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In verse 8 Peter also says that the Devil is as a roaring lion walking about, seeking someone to devour.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The word roaring indicates that this lion, the Devil, is howling in hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The words walks about indicate the Devil s constant and aggressive activity in seeking prey.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is a proverb which says that the Devil never sleeps.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is always busy and aggressive, seeking someone to devour.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Here Peter warns the suffering believers in persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If they would not be humbled under God s mighty hand and cast their anxiety on God, they will be devoured by the roaring lion, the Devil, their adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This teaches us that pride and anxiety make us delicious prey to fill the hunger of the roaring lion.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this respect Peter no doubt could not forget the Lord s warning to him regarding the Devil s desire Luke 22:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Peter s writing in verse 8 is simple, short, and to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We all have something to learn of him, especially in the giving of testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Certain testimonies are long stories, filled with unnecessary details.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Instead of long stories in the meetings, we need testimonies that are brief and to the point.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Often this kind of testimony is most effective.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>STANDING FIRMLY IN THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In verse 9 Peter says, Whom withstand, firm in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being accomplished in your brotherhood in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To withstand here does not mean to resist nor to struggle against.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is to stand firmly as a rock on the ground of our faith before the roaring Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this verse the faith actually means our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It refers to the believers subjective faith, their faith in God s protecting power and loving concern.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In verse 9 Peter says that the same sufferings are accomplished in our brotherhood in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>According to the context of this chapter and the preceding one, these sufferings are sufferings in persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have seen that the brotherhood is the aggregate of the brothers, the family of the brothers, the brothers in the feeling of brotherliness 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The anxiety spoken of in 5:7 is related to persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When saints are under persecution, they are anxious, not knowing what will happen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This anxiety, this worry, may cause them to doubt the gospel they have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This may have a negative effect on their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>For this reason, Peter charges the believers to withstand the Devil by remaining firm in the faith, that is, firm in their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Instead of doubting what we believe, we need to be firm in our faith, knowing that the same sufferings of persecution are being accomplished in the brotherhood throughout the world.</S>
