Admiring God as the One Enthroned at the Flood<br>and Sitting as King Forever</H2><P>David also admired God as the One enthroned at the Flood and sitting as King forever (v. 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Blessing the People of God<br>with God's Giving Strength to Them<br>and His Blessing Them in Peace</H2><P>At the end of Psalm 29, David blessed the people of God with God's giving strength to them and His blessing them in peace (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. IN HIS SONG AT THE DEDICATION<br>OF THE HOUSE OF GOD</H2><P>Psalm 30 shows us the mixed expressions of David's sentiment in his song at the dedication of the house of God. The house of God, the temple, was built and dedicated after David's death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Extolling God for His Lifting Him Up<br>over His Enemies, for His Healing, and<br>for His Deliverance of His Soul from Sheol</H2><P>David extolled God for His lifting him up over his enemies, for His healing, and for His deliverance of his soul from Sheol (vv. 1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Exhorting God's Saints to Psalm to Him<br>and Praise His Holy Name</H2><P>David also exhorted God's saints to psalm to God and to praise God's holy name (v. 4). God's holy name is His memorial. Then he said that God's anger lasts but a moment, but His favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may linger in the evening, but a ringing shout goes up in the morning (v. 5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Prospering and Never Being Shaken</H2><P>In verse 6 David said, "As for me, I said in my prosperity,/I will never be shaken." Although David said this in Psalm 30, he surely was not prospering when he was being chased by his rebellious son, Absalom. In verse 7 David said that God made his mountain strong. His mountain refers to his empire, his kingdom.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_116.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_118.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 117</div><br></body></html>
