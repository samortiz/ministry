<P>Oh, how excellent is the glory to come! Oh, how complete is the salvation God has given us! Now is the time for us to rise and go up. Oh, may "heaven" so saturate us that the flesh has no more ground and the world poses no more distraction. Oh, may the love of the Father be so much in us that we have nothing more to do with His enemy! Oh, may the Lord Jesus so satisfy our hearts that we desire nothing else besides Him! Oh, may the Holy Spirit create in every believer a prayer that cries, "Lord Jesus, come quickly!"</P><P CLASS=HBODY>You will not die, but will be raptured to see the Lord!<br>This is the pathway the Father has lately shown.<br>The Holy Spirit has this clearly taught,<br>That we may turn from the world to the throne.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>You will not die, but will be raptured to see the Lord!<br>Oh what glory, we will return to our heavenly place!<br>In the twinkling of an eye we will be fully changed,<br>And will be raptured to see Him face to face!</P><P CLASS=HBODY>You will not die, but will be raptured to see the Lord!<br>Such promise is true and faithful indeed.<br>Though we know not the day or the hour,<br>We feel that the time is drawing close.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>You will not die, therefore be sanctified,<br>Cut off all ties with all sins,<br>The world soon passes away, and heaven's glory will appear,<br>May we pass our days in godliness.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>You will be raptured to see the Lord in the air!<br>Therefore keep your spirit from all earthly defilements,<br>We are not waiting to die here,<br>But are looking moment by moment to be raptured<br>from this world.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>You will not die, but will be raptured to see the Lord!<br>Advance therefore until the day breaks.<br>Hold fast, that no one takes away your crown,<br>For soon, the Lord will reward you with the throne.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>You will not die, but will be raptured to see the Lord!<br>God's children, what victory this is!<br>Your spirit should say, "Come Lord!<br>Come quickly, and be with us forever."</P>
