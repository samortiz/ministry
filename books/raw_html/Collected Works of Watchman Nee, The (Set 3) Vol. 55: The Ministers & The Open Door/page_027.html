        <h2 class="head1">BROTHERS AND SISTERS GOING THROUGH<br />TRIAL OF FAMINE IN CH'ANG-CH'UN</h2><p>The famine in Ch'ang-ch'un is very serious. One catty (about a pound) of red rice costs fifty million yen. A sack of flour costs more than four billion. We want to escape but cannot get free. The brothers have enough food to last for about another month (on the average). No one can afford to buy anything to eat. If there is no other way to relieve the urgent need, it is possible that we will all starve to death. More than forty brothers escaped at the beginning of June. The sisters went to the border twenty miles away, but were not allowed entry, nor were they allowed to go back. They had to sleep under the stars. They ate all the food they had brought with them and were forced to eat grass and even leaves of trees. I am afraid that Hua Tien-min's old mother and Kuo Sheng-mo's mother have already starved to death. The horses have all been killed and eaten, but there is still no deliverance. The denominational churches in the city have tried to find some ways to give out a little food, but they cannot help much. Only one sister who fled has safely made it to Peking. She walked and crawled for more than a month to get there...</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Ai-guang<br />August 14, 1948</p><p>Temporary Mailing Address: c/o 10 Interior Alley, Fukien</p><h2 class="head1">SPIRIT AND SOUL BEING REFRESHED</h2><p>Peace to my two dear and respected brothers in the Lord, Watchman and Witness:</p><p>Thank and praise the Lord who loves us that you have not forgotten your little brother living far away. I have received both The Ministers and The Glad Tidings. These two publications are really like the Lord's anointing, and they refreshed my spirit and soul. They are also like drops of dew on the grass. I felt watered by them. I can only loudly sing hallelujah to praise our Father God. I have not been able to write to you until now because of the weakness of my flesh and the bondage of worldly affairs. I hope you will pray much for me, your weak younger brother. May the Lord bless your work so that it will not only water and feed the weak brothers but will cause many people to leave darkness and turn to light. Glory be to the Lord's name. Amen.</p><p>Lee Jin-kui<br />August 2, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: Mao-Sin Soap Factory, Shaoyang, Hunan</p><h2 class="head1">LESSONS LEARNED ON A NAVAL SHIP</h2><p>I lost my job last year, and the Lord arranged for me to come to Subic Bay in the Philippines to care for the medical needs of fifty to sixty people on a naval ship. I am the only believer on the ship. I have been here for six months already. Praise the Lord for putting me in this lonely place. I have maintained my daily Bible reading in a normal way. He is teaching me lessons that I have not yet learned. I am quietly enduring this boring life, looking to Him, and meeting with Him. The sailors on the ship all feel that life is bothersome and boring, but inwardly I am filled with His joy and rest. It is really like Brother Lawrence pulling up a weed from the earth and being happy because he loved God. Thank God, I also have His presence. He has also led me to do some things pleasing to Him aboard this ship. I am lowly and weak, possessing nothing, but the God of mercy wants His grace to be perfected in a person as lowly as me. It is extremely marvelous that two people from Sian in the North have been clearly saved. They have recently learned to have fresh fellowship with God inwardly. I often receive a supply of life from their prayers. Truly, the gospel is not of the letter, but it is the out-flowing of life and the result of God's mercy. I echo the words of Madame Guyon which you wrote to me long ago: "Just as air fills a vacuum, so also does God fill those who empty themselves." I have nothing to say but, "Praise the Lord for His great love!" He "will have mercy on whomever [He] will have mercy, and [He] will have compassion on whomever [He] will have compassion" (Rom. 9:15). Dear elder brother in the Lord, I often feel that I will obey His voice when the time comes. I am still immature and need to be concerned with practical things and with learning the basics. May the Lord have compassion on me. Amen.</p><p>I also hope you will remember me in spirit! Last month the Lord gave me enough time to make a trip to Manila. I did not have any outward curiosity. My heart's desire was to visit the brothers and sisters in the Lord in that city. I was able to fellowship with them during this visit. I stayed in Manila for a week in the home of Sister Huang Chi-ai. I feel that the Lord has especially laid hold of a group of brothers there who are somewhat clear regarding the inward leading of life. Recently, the church has been greatly touched by the news that some brothers and sisters in Shanghai made absolute consecrations and that the work is spreading everywhere. The saints here really hope that God would send an elderly servant here to edify them. They all treasure the news from Shanghai. We believe that God has begun His work and will complete it. May God bless the church. Amen.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Yen Chang-tao<br />July 18, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: Mr. C. T. Ien L.S.T. 982 c/o post office, Olongapo Zambales, P.

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
