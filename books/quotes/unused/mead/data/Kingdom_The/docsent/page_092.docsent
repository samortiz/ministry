   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMING OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible says clearly that the Lord Jesus is with us all the days until the consummation of the age Matt 28:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since He is with us, how can He come in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is He not here today?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since He is here already, how can He come?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is something wonderful and it cannot be systematized.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Never rely on your natural concepts when studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Your natural concept cannot give you a proper understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand the Lord Jesus is here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the other hand He is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that He has already come as the seed, but He is coming and will come as the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has come as the seed, and He is coming as the seed grows.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, He will come in full as the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although nearly two thousand years have passed, the Lord Jesus has not yet come because the seed has lacked the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Due to the shortage of growth it is difficult for Him to have the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The coming of the Lord will not be a sudden occurrence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day the Lord Jesus will come, but not in the way you have probably thought.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus will not merely come from the heavens, but will come from within you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You are expecting Him to suddenly descend from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, you must realize that He will come out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when the Lord Jesus comes out of you, He will not leave you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To all the unbelievers, He will descend from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But to us, the believers, He will not come from the heavens He will come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How else can we interpret the statements that the Lord is with us and that He is also coming.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord has come into us, He is growing within us, and He is transforming us by performing a metabolic work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His coming is the completion of this work of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord will not merely come out of heaven; He will come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Together with Brother Watchman Nee we have considered all the schools of theology.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We worked together, talked together, and fellowshipped what we had read.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this way we helped one another and we came to know all of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do know where we stand and we do know what the Lord has committed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We read many of the books about the Lord's second coming, studying the schools of pre-tribulation and post-tribulation, pre-millennial and post-millennial.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also studied the different views about the rapture: the partial rapture, the pre-tribulation rapture, and the post-tribulation rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By the Lord's grace and for the sake of His recovery, He has shown us this mysterious way that His coming back is not according to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to our natural concept, the Lord sits on the throne watching and bestowing blessings until the day when He will suddenly appear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nearly every theological book speaks of the coming of the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Lord Jesus is coming by the growth of life, not by a sudden appearance from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I know that you may quote Philippians 3:20 which says that we are waiting for the Lord Jesus to come from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But you must also read Matthew 28:20 which says that the Lord is with us all the days.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I cannot tell you how much time we have spent studying these two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can you reconcile them?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You simply cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, it is a fact that the Lord Jesus has sown Himself into us and that He is now growing within us, transforming us, and becoming matured within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When He has ripened and matured within and through us, that will be the time of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To us, His coming will not be a sudden event.</S>
