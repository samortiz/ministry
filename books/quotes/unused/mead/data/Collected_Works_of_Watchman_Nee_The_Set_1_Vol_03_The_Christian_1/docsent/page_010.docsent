   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are other clues concerning the sea being the place of detention for demons.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Septuagint Bible, the word "deep" in Genesis 1:2 is the same as "abyss" here.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have said that these demons are probably created races who lived in the first world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This corresponds to what we read in Genesis 1:2 because they originally lived on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After sinning, their bodies were destroyed by God; their habitation was judged by God and became without form and void.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The whole earth was covered by water and was characterized as "the deep."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It follows then that the spirits of the races at that time were in this "deep"!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Finally, on the third day when God restored the earth, He commanded the earth to come out from the water and called the gathering of the waters the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This earth was prepared for mankind in the new world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where then have the former demons gone?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can spontaneously answer that they went into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we read Revelation 20:13, we often do not understand why the sea will give up the dead which are in it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is understandable to say that death and Hades will deliver up the dead which are in them, but why will the sea give up the dead which are in it?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The common interpretation is that the sea surrenders the bodies of those who are drowned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If so, then the earth should also give up its dead because there are more bodies buried in the earth than in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet the earth does not give up its dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the sea will give up the spirits of the imprisoned ones and not the bodies of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Men's spirits are in death and Hades; the Bible does not say that the spirits of man are kept in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then whose spirits will the sea give up?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It will give up those who are from the other world, that is, the former world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sequence here indicates this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who lived in the former world died first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, they will be the first beings to be given up; then, we who are of this world will follow after because every man will be judged in his own order.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus far we have seen the probable origin of Satan, his angels, and the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As to how man lived on the former earth, this is something beyond our knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we can see some hints in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Bible scholars, Dr. Scofield being one of them, believe that Jeremiah 4:23-26 refers to the condition of Genesis 1:2, in which the earth was without form and void.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although the context of this passage is the desolation of Judah, these few verses of the Scripture have a notably broader view, as if God caused the prophet to view the desolation of the earth in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our belief is accurate, then we know that in the former world there was "the fruitful land" and "its cities" v. 26 . The inhabitants then dwelt in cities and some took up farming as an occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they were deceived by Satan, the burning anger of Jehovah came upon them v. 26 and the earth became "waste and emptiness" v. 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From these biblical clues we see the original situation of the earth, the races who dwelt on the earth, the paradise, and the princes, etc. If we are not mistaken in our meditation, we can draw a conclusion concerning the first world and the cause of its desolation as follows: In the beginning of "time" as opposed to eternity God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The earth was not waste Isa 45:18 but very beautiful and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On this earth there were inhabitants and the number of the inhabitants was great.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before God created the earth and human beings, He had created the angels Job 38:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He assigned Satan, whom He created, as the leader to be above all the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Satan, the most beautiful and wisest of all, the prime of all God's creation, dwelt in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God made him the ruler of the world; therefore, he was called "the ruler of the world" John 14:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many angels were under his rule, and these angels shared in ruling with him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, because of his position and honor, he became proud.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Due to pride, he rebelled and lifted himself up to be equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was not satisfied with being a creature, but desired to be the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, he slandered God before the people and accused the people before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God found out his iniquity and condemned him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the time comes, he will be cast to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One third of the angels Rev 12 followed him in rebellion and, therefore, became the angels of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has prepared hell for them Matt 25:41 , and when the time comes, Satan will be cast into it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the former world, the inhabitants of the earth, being under Satan and his angels' rule, were also deceived and filled up with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can readily understand this when we consider our world situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, God's anger was fierce, and He completely destroyed the earth and all the races therein and locked up many spirits in the abyss in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These evil spirits, angels, and Satan himself formed the kingdom of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not know how long this period lasted.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Later, the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters again, and the Triune God began His restoration work on the world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After His restoration of the world, He created Adam and his wife and asked them to guard it, so that there would be man on the earth to cooperate with Him in heaven to stop Satan's power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps God used Adam to test Satan to see whether he would repent.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, he came to tempt Adam; therefore, God cursed Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because Adam fell, he could not bring the world which was under Satan's rule back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the contrary, the world Adam received from God's hand was given anew to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since angels and mankind had failed, God came in the person of the Son to be a man, the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus became God's prophet, priest, and king.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When He was on this earth, He was God's prophet without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When He was about to die, He was able to say, "The ruler of the world is coming, and in Me he has nothing" John 14:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At His death all who are in Adam were crucified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was able to include all of the old Adamic creation in His crucifixion because He is God, and He is able to continue on as the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His human living had nothing to do with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through His death and resurrection, He regained the world lost by the first Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every sinner, who is destined to die in the old Adam, can return to God and be saved if he rejects the first Adam through the death of the last Adam and joins himself to Christ in life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the meaning of believing in the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, whoever believes in the Lord Jesus becomes an enemy of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In everything he attacks us, and in everything we resist him, his angels, and the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is God's purpose in saving man, and this is a real spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Satan was judged once on the "holy mountain of God," and he was judged again on the hill of Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He has been convicted, yet his judgment has not yet been executed.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the time comes he will be cast down from heaven and when the Son of God returns to this earth, he will be cast into the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After one thousand years he will forever suffer in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Now the Lord Jesus holds the authority which Satan had abused, and He will hold it until all traces of rebellion disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He has brought His own blood into the Holy of Holies and has cleansed the heavens; He is now a Priest of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When He returns, it will be the time of the restoration of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He will be a King, ruling this world from heaven with all the overcoming saints, in the same way that Satan ruled with his angels in the former time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At that time He will teach the inhabitants of this earth to know God's will and to worship God, in the same way that Satan did in the former days.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The situation in the millennium will be like the situation in the world before Satan sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ will restore all things to the condition in the "beginning" in order to accomplish God's original purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After this He will burn up the whole world, and there will be a new heaven and a new earth in which the righteous will dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, as God's children we ought to have a deeper enmity for the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>For thousands of years God's only purpose has been for man to be joined with Him to destroy Satan's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our God is a law-abiding God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He will not take back by force the world which was lost through man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, He sent His Son to become a man in order to regain what man had lost.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We, men who have been saved, ought to cooperate with the unique "Man," the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In our life, in our work, in our environment, in our dwelling, and in the world, we should resist the works of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Our resistance is in firmness of faith 1 Pet 5:9 , and not by means of fleshly weapons 2 Cor 10:4 , which is the way of social reformers who are being utilized by the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Satan was wise and beautiful!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But because of his pride, he ended up in complete ruin.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is dangerous for frail mortals to esteem themselves wise and beautiful!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Beware, lest being lifted up with pride, you fall into the judgment of the devil 1 Tim 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Being self-exalted with pride is not a blessing to man; wisdom rests only with those who fear the most high God Jehovah.</S>
