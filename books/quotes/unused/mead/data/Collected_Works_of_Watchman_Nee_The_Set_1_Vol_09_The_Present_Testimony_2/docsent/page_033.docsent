   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE RIVER JORDAN DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>VERSES 7 THROUGH 14</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Jordan signifies the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Crossing the Jordan is overcoming death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is to be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is especially related to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord was baptized in the river Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's baptism signifies death, and coming out of the water signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the power of resurrection, the Lord overcomes death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The greatest power of Satan is death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord seems to have said to the enemy, "Try your best to do what you can to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Satan exhausted what he could do; but God resurrected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Satan wanted the Lord to die, but the Lord has a life which death cannot touch or hold down.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord passed through it on dry land!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is no power other than the Lord's resurrection which can overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We obtained this resurrection life at regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The power of the resurrection life will wash away all death and everything that is of death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a difference between crossing the Red Sea and crossing the river Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The crossing of the Red Sea was forced upon the Israelites at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They had no alternative but to cross over because there were enemies pursuing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But crossing the river Jordan comes out of man's willingness and is man's own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are some who will not cross the river Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many do not want the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul regarded the power of resurrection as important, and he pursued it Phil 3:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many people have already resurrected with the Lord, yet they still do not know the power of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, they do not have the experience of overcoming death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At this hour when the rapture is imminent, the last enemy that believers should overcome is death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether it is the death of the body, the death of the mind, or the death of the spiritual life, everything should be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The present world is truly filled with the atmosphere of death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, many who are used by the Lord often experience weakness and sickness in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, the mental ability of many seems to have grown so numb that their thoughts, memory, and concentration are not as focused as before.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, many seem to have their spirit surrounded by death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are not lively but, rather, are powerless and impotent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They seem to be paralyzed and unable to control or deal with the demand of the circumstances upon their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While preparing to be raptured, the believers must learn how to cross the Jordan and overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They must learn to resist the power of death that exists in them and in their environment and must manifest the power of resurrection in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should prove more and more that our Lord is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the same time, we should demonstrate that we are joined to Him and have also been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we want to receive the rapture of Elijah and the outer garment of Elisha the Holy Spirit , we must start from Gilgal and continue until we cross the river Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Holy Spirit can only descend upon those who are full of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must not think that since we are born again, we will surely be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God cannot rapture those who are not prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must pass through Gilgal, Bethel, Jericho, and the river Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must pass through all these places before we can be raptured, just as Elijah did in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has told us that we will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we need to follow our course.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should start from Gilgal and go on until we cross the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is waiting for us there!</S>
