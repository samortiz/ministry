   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Isaac's birth represents gold, but Jacob's experience represents precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaac was born a son through the promise of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He never suffered, nor was he ever seriously at fault.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jacob's case, however, was quite different.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He suffered very much and passed through many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's hand was upon him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Day after day and year after year, God wrought something into Jacob which caused him to become a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That life which God has imparted to us is the gold, while the life which God is constituting in us is the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Day after day, in all kinds of circumstances, He is making us in the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God does not stop by just giving us a portion of Christ's life; He wants to have the life of Christ wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On one hand, we must realize that except for the Lord's life in us we are not any different than we were prior to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But on the other hand, after following the Lord for five or ten years and being disciplined and dealt with by Him, a portion of the life of Christ has been constituted in us by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is something within us which has been formed by the Lord, and this is the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You should not be surprised when God continually puts you into the fire to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seems that the things which other people encounter are all good, but the things which you are up against are not prosperous or easy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You are even misunderstood and attacked by others; more things have happened to you than to anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But you must realize that it is not without a cause.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is continually burning you; the Holy Spirit is working to constitute more of the life of Christ in you so that you may be transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Revelation we find not just one kind of precious stone, but all kinds of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some are jasper, some sapphire, some chalcedony, some emerald, some sardonyx, some sardius, and other kinds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of these precious stones are the product of burning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were not formed by God in a moment of time but obtained after being wrought upon through long years of God's working.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Precious stone was not given to us at creation, nor is it something we obtained when we became a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Precious stone is formed in us through God's burning day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a substance which is constantly put into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the fire burns in a certain way, a certain kind of mineral is melted into that substance, and it becomes a certain kind of precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the fire burns in another way, it causes another kind of mineral to be dissolved into that substance, causing it to become another kind of precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Different ways of melting certain minerals together form various kinds of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The precious stones represent the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we were saved we obtained God's nature, but from that time, day after day, the Holy Spirit has been working the nature of God into us so that we may bear the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is not just one fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, and many others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Holy Spirit must continually work in us to cause us to bear all these different kinds of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we were saved, God imparted His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the fruit of the Spirit is not something imparted to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We bear these fruits when the Holy Spirit works within us to a certain extent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even so, precious stone is something formed in us through the Holy Spirit by means of many different circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only has God shared His nature with us, but day by day He is making us a certain kind of people who can bring glory to His name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you were saved, you obtained God's nature, and when I was saved, I obtained His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this regard, all Christians are the same; they all have obtained God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But in the ensuing days, God may have put you into certain circumstances in order to give you certain kinds of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He may have let you go through certain trials, certain difficulties, and certain sufferings so that you will become a Christian like chrysolite, chalcedony, sardius, or some other precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is working in every Christian so that each one may become a certain kind of precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all have gold in common before God, but after we become precious stones before Him, we will each be a certain form.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What the Holy Spirit forms in us by means of the environment will abide forever.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a Christian receives more dealings in a certain way, he will learn more lessons in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This will produce an outstanding character in him, a character which will not come to an end after several years, but which will abide for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What he has obtained will forever be a precious stone in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In many of God's children who have walked with Him for ten or twenty years, there is something which God has wrought through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not just that God has imparted something to them, but they themselves have become that something; it is their very constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They have been disciplined by the Holy Spirit for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By passing through many trials and experiences, the Holy Spirit has formed a certain kind of life in them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who are acquainted with them acknowledge that something has indeed been accomplished in them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They not only possess the life that is given to them by God, but they also have a transformed life which the Holy Spirit has wrought within them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Not only do they live an exchanged life but also a transformed life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Precious stone is that which has been formed in us by the burning work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The New Jerusalem will be filled with these precious stones.</S>
