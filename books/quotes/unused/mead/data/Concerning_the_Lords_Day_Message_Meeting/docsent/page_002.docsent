   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTERS OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today we want to spend some time to see the situation concerning the ministers of the word in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>NO NEED TO MAINTAIN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE LORD S DAY MESSAGE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to our past custom, the churches in every locality have always maintained the Lord s Day message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the co-workers meeting in Hankow, we saw quite clearly that there was no need for a local church to maintain the Lord s Day message meeting, because this kind of meeting is not a church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The messages recorded in The Normal Christian Church Life speak concerning this in a very detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The prayer meeting is a meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The supplying by the ministers of the word in 1 Corinthians 14 is a meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The table meeting is a meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord s Day morning preaching meeting, however, is something of Catholicism and Protestantism; it is not a meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, it is a meeting of the work rather than a meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Reason We Could Not Abolish It Following What the Nations Do</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although there is no need to maintain the preaching on the Lord s Day in a local church, what has been our experience in the ten years since the meetings in Hankow?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are still maintaining the Lord s Day message meeting, following what the nations around us do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seems that many localities cannot endure the absence of preaching on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because the nations around us have preaching on the Lord s Day, we find it hard to relinquish it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have followed the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the ten years from 1938 to 1948, we have seen that the preaching on the Lord s Day is not a meeting of the local church; what we saw in Hankow was right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, we have been unable to leave it even until today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the difficulty?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Having Nothing to Replace It</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I think a big reason for this is that there would be nothing with which to replace it if we abolished the Lord s Day preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The nations practice this, so if the brothers in our midst do not, it would be very difficult to maintain the meetings in their localities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since the people in the denominations listen to a message, we seem to feel that it would be very hard if there were no messages to listen to when they come into our midst on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Result of Not Abolishing It Still Needing to Build Up the Pastoral System</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, within these few years not one locality has successfully carried out what we saw in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We still have the problem that we had before the meetings in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before the meetings in Hankow, we saw that it is wrong for a brother who is a worker to always remain in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers who are workers should be scattered to many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But today it seems that a worker still needs to live in a particular place in order to maintain the Lord s Day message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as we need to maintain the Lord s Day message meeting, we build up the pastoral system.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we need to maintain the Lord s Day message meeting, then there is the need for a worker to live in a place to do that work, since local brothers have no way of maintaining the Lord s Day message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I hope that when you brothers have time, you will again read the messages given in The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The meetings for edification, the table meetings, the prayer meetings, and the gospel preaching meetings are all meetings of the church, but maintaining the Lord s Day message meeting is the behavior of the nations and not something of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We admit our failure of the past ten years; we cannot be proud.</S>
