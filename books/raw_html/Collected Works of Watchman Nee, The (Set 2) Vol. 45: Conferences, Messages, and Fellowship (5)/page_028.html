<h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S WORD BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2><p>God's Word is merely theological knowledge to many people; it is not life to them. But the Lord says that His word is spirit and life. The word of God touches our spirit and our life; it does not relate to our mind. It matters little if the mind does not understand. In reading a book or listening to a sermon, we can tell immediately whether we have touched spirit and life within or whether we have touched the mind. If we have heard only knowledge, the result is death, and we feel uneasy within. If we have heard spirit and life, the result is peace and assurance within.</p><p>The less mature a Christian is, the more answers he has. But God does not furnish definitive answers in the Bible. It is a sign of hyperactivity of the mind to demand clarity in doctrine. All we have to do is to take a passage, a verse, or a few sentences from the Scripture and speak it plainly. We only need to touch spirit and life; we do not need to build up others' intellect or give them much knowledge. If we touch spirit and life, others will be refreshed, and they will receive the genuine help.</p><p>When I was in London, I once sat with some out-of-town visitors during a message by Brother Sparks. Afterwards I asked whether they had received any help. They answered that the teaching was good, but that he had omitted many points. They only paid attention to theology. They were not there to receive life-nourishment, but mental knowledge. We would rather not touch so many points, but concentrate on one point which renders help to others. This is the value of spirit and life: It is sufficient if only one point within a broad subject touches others and meets their needs.</p><p>God is after a weak person, one who is dependent on Him. Those who truly know the cross are weak. May the Lord take away our desire to deliver perfect messages or to write perfect books, and may we not hinder the work of the Spirit. May we not exercise the kind of human wisdom and natural eloquence that will induce others' expectation for our speaking. A good message that only reaches others' minds is unprofitable. Many people are too good at speaking. As a result, others only see the speaker; they do not see God. They only hear man's words of wisdom; they do not hear the word of God.</p><p>I used to have my own standard concerning the messages I delivered and the books I wrote. Sometimes I would feel bad after delivering a message on Sunday, because I felt that I came short of my own expectation. Actually, God does not need to use our entire message, nor all the verses that we quote. Sometimes He only uses one or two words. The Bible says that God's word is life. We can ignore man's misunderstanding. If God is not afraid of misunderstanding, why should we be afraid of it? He is responsible for everything. Only the flesh tries to have a perfect message. God has no intention of achieving any perfection in the mind; He is only after perfection in spirit and life. We often feel discouraged when others do not understand our message. But actually, the hungry ones receive the help, while those who understand the message do not receive anything. The word of God is spirit and life; it divides the soul from the spirit. If a man has nothing to give except Bible knowledge, those who listen will find his speaking fruitless and childish.</p><p>Once I was about to meet a sister. Before she came to me I asked the Lord to stop me from using any words of wisdom. Words of wisdom can only educate the mind. I asked the Lord to give me words of light. When she came, I spoke much, but she was still unenlightened. At a certain point in the conversation, she suddenly became clear and asked me to repeat the sentence that had just helped her. She wanted to remember what I had just said. I told her that I did not know what I had said that had helped her. Later, I recalled what I had said and repeated it, and she tried to memorize it. This shows that the profit derived from God's word has nothing to do with one's memory; it has to do with spirit and life. Many people remember words that others have said, but these words do not render anyone any help. But many forgotten words are often the source of life supply.</p><p>Dividing the word of God does not mean merely breaking it down into sections and subdivisions. It has to do with the dividing of the soul and the spirit. It is like dividing the bone from the marrow by a sword. God's word often can bypass our mind and go straight into our spirit. Christ did not say that His words are theology, teachings, or answers. We know that many people are anti-theology and anti-teaching, but we are not talking about that here. We are saying that the Lord's word is spirit and life. Paul told Timothy to cut straight the word of the truth. However, only those who are cut by God can cut straight God's word. In our Bible we have to put Hebrews 4:12 before 2 Timothy 2:15. May the Lord speak to us within and deliver us from doctrines and theology, and may we truly know that God's word is spirit and life.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, remove our ambition for gaining knowledge. May we gladly prostrate ourselves in the dust. May we be delivered out of the superficiality of the Bible and into its depths.</p>
