   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR DAVID'S KNOWLEDGE OF AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 24:4-6; 26:9, 11; 2 Sam 1:14 DAVID GAINING THE THRONE WITHOUT PAYING THE PRICE OF REBELLION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During the setting up of the kingdom of Israel, God officially established His authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Israelites entered Canaan they asked God for a king, and God sent Samuel to anoint Saul as their first king 1 Sam 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Saul was chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God set him up as the authority, that is, as His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when he became king, Saul did not submit to the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He violated God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In refusing to kill the king of Amalek and the best of the sheep and oxen, he rebelled against God and disobeyed His words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, God set Saul aside and anointed David 1 Sam 15 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, David was under Saul's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was one of Saul's subjects and was even a soldier in Saul's camp.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later, he even became Saul's son-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both of these men had the anointing upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Saul often sought to kill David.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There were two kings in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One was set aside but still sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The other was chosen but not inaugurated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At this juncture David was in a very difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Samuel 24 we see Saul chasing David in the wilderness of Engedi.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Saul went into a cave to cover his feet, David and his followers were in the innermost part of the cave.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His followers suggested that David kill Saul, but David rejected the temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He dared not rebel against authority with his own hands vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>David was anointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Concerning the throne, he stood in the proper position of God's plan and will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who would have had anything to say about him being king?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What would be wrong if David helped himself become king?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Would it not be a good way to help God to accomplish His will?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But David deeply felt that this could not be done.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he had killed Saul, it would have been in the principle of rebellion against God's authority, because God's anointing was still upon Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although Saul was rejected, he was still God's anointed and still set up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he had killed Saul, David could have become king immediately, and God's will would not have been delayed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But David was a man that denied his self.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He would rather see his kingship postponed and God's plan delayed than to become a rebellious one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result he was eventually made God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At one time God set Saul to be king and David was under Saul's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If David had killed Saul, he would have gained the kingship at the price of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He would have fallen on the ground of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>David dared not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the same in principle as Michael not daring to bring a reviling judgment against Satan Jude 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Authority is a tremendous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>SUBMISSION BEING HIGHER THAN OUR WORK</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a man is to serve God, he must submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Submission is higher than our work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if David set the whole kingdom in order, this would avail nothing without being under God's authority; he would still be like Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Old Testament Saul loved the best of the sheep and the oxen and would not destroy them, but rather saved them for offering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is in the same principle of rebellion as Judas in the New Testament, who betrayed the Lord Jesus out of his love for thirty pieces of silver Matt 26:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Offerings cannot cover up rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If David wanted to accomplish God's will and plan, he could have killed Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then he could have served God right away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But David dared not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He waited for God to work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was willing to be submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>David only cut off the skirt of Saul's cloak, and even then his heart smote him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His feeling was as sensitive as a New Testament believer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What we condemn is not just murder; even the cutting off of another's garment with a little knife is wrong and is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Backbiting, an evil eye, or a grudge in the heart may not be murder, but they are similar to the cutting off of another's garment, and they proceed from a spirit of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>David was one who knew God's authority from his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was chased by Saul many times, yet he still submitted to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He considered Saul as lord, the anointed of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This speaks of an important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Submission to authority is not submission to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is submission to the anointing upon the person, the anointing which was upon him when God set him up as authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>David knew of the anointing on Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He acknowledged that Saul was God's anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, he could only seek for his own escape; he could not put forth his hand to hurt Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Saul was disobedient to God's command.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He was rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But this was something between Saul and God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As for David, he submitted to God's anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This was David's responsibility before God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>DAVID UPHOLDING GOD'S AUTHORITY IN AN ABSOLUTE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God wants His authority to be upheld in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He has to recover this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Look again into 1 Samuel 26.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A similar thing happened in the wilderness of Ziph.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A second temptation came.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Saul fell asleep, and David came into the place where he slept.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Abishai wanted to kill Saul, but David forbade him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He swore and said, "Who can stretch forth his hand against Jehovah's anointed and be guiltless?"</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the second time that David spared Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He only took Saul's spear and water jug vv.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>7-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This was an improvement from the previous time.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He did not take anything from Saul's body.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Instead, he only took something from beside his body.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He gave up the chance of saving his own life to submit to and uphold God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>According to 1 Samuel 31 and 2 Samuel 1, Saul killed himself.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A young Amalekite came to David to claim the credit, saying that he had killed Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>David's attitude was still that of denying the self and submitting to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He said to the man, "How is it that you were not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed?"</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>2 Sam 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Then he ordered that the young messenger be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Because David maintained God's authority, he was called a man after God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>His kingdom has been preserved until now, for the Lord is a descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Only those who submit to authority can themselves be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must uproot rebellion from among us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In order to be an authority, there must first be submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This one matter is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Apart from this, we have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The church is an organ of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There is no need to fear the weak ones in the church; there is only the need to fear the rebellious ones.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We must submit to God's authority from our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Only then will the church be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The way ahead depends on us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We are here to spend our days in a sober way.</S>
