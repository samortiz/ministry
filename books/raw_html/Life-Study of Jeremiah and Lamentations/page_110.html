<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISRAEL'S SIN AGAINST JEHOVAH<br>AND<br>JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT UPON ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(14)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JEREMIAH'S GENUINE PROPHECIES<br>VERSUS THE OTHERS' FALSE PROPHECIES</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Jer. 27&#151;29</H1><P>In this message we will cover chapters twenty-seven through twenty-nine. These chapters are on Jeremiah's genuine prophecies versus the others' false prophecies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CONCERNING NEBUCHADNEZZAR<br>AS BONDS AND YOKES ON ISRAEL<br>AND THE NATIONS AROUND HER</H2><P>Jeremiah 27:1-15 concerns Nebuchadnezzar as bonds and yokes on Israel and the nations around her.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jeremiah's Genuine Prophecy</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah Having Given Israel<br>and All the Nations around Her<br>to Nebuchadnezzar</H2><P>Jeremiah prophesied that Jehovah had given Israel and all the nations around her into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. They should all be under his yoke (as demonstrated by the prophet Jeremiah with the bond and yoke put on him) and serve him and his son and his son's son until the time of revenge upon his own land comes (vv. 2-7, 11-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Any Nation or Kingdom<br>Not Serving Nebuchadnezzar<br>to Be Punished by Jehovah unto Death</H2><P>Any nation or kingdom not serving Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and not putting its neck under his yoke would be punished by Jehovah unto death with sword, famine, and pestilence (v. 8). In verse 13 Jeremiah went on to say, "Why will you die, you and your people, by sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as Jehovah has spoken concerning the nation which will not serve the king of Babylon?"</P>
