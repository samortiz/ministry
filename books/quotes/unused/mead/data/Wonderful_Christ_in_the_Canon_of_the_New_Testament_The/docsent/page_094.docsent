   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILT UPON GOD S FAITHFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Around the New Jerusalem a wall is built with twelve foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These twelve foundations are twelve different kinds of precious stones Rev 21:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The wall is all of jasper, and the first foundation of the wall is also of jasper Rev 21:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the twelve foundations of the wall of the city are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb Rev 21:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I read an article which said that the colors of these precious stones are exactly the same as the colors of a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Revelation 4:2-3, John saw God on the throne, and He looked like jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And immediately I was in spirit, and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne, and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God on the throne appears like jasper, and the expression of the New Jerusalem also appears like jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Having the glory of God; and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal Rev 21:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that the New Jerusalem is the very expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also see that around the throne there is a rainbow Rev 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This corresponds with the foundations of the wall of the city which also look like a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A rainbow signifies God s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The foundation of this city is based upon God s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The rainbow around God s throne also speaks of His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>NOT A PHYSICAL PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BUT A LIVING COMPOSITION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we have seen the harvest and consummation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 21 and 22 are the full harvest of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything that is sown in the Scriptures is reaped in these two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The tree of life, the flowing river, the precious materials are all harvested here.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This consummation is God s complete building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It should not be considered as a physical place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This picture of the New Jerusalem symbolizes that God in eternity will have a great living habitation composed of all the Old Testament and New Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The names of the twelve tribes are written on the twelve gates Rev 21:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This signifies that all the Old Testament saints are there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The names of the twelve Apostles on the twelve foundations of the wall represent the New Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Revelation 3:12, we have a good illustration: Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This verse reveals that the New Jerusalem, God s temple, is not a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are God s temple, and this temple is eventually enlarged into a city.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Old Testament the temple was God s habitation, and now this city-temple will be God s habitation for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The overcomers who have been built into God s temple will all be part of God s eternal habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way we can see that the New Jerusalem is not a physical building, but a living composition composed of all God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For centuries these last two chapters of the Bible have not been opened up to the church as they are today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peter is a layer of the foundation, and John is a layer of the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do believe that we will all be the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In eternity we will all look like jasper stones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There will be no white face, no black face, no yellow face, but all jasper faces!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will not express American, Spanish, Chinese, or Japanese, but we will express the unique God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God on the throne looks like jasper, and we will be there for eternity looking also like jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Satan did his best to damage us, but God purged away all our negative elements into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything of Satan that came into us in the garden of Eden is now in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we are the same as God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every saint in eternity will lose his identification, but this does not mean that we will lose our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We will all look like jasper stone in the appearance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>HEAT AND PRESSURE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Precious stones are not created, but are formed under the earth mainly by heat and pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have been told that there are some manufacturers today who produce diamonds by using high heat and pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God knows how to surround us with just the right heat and pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the brothers realize that their wives are good heaters, and their children produce much pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For the sisters, their husbands and children produce the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It sometimes seems that we cannot stand it any longer, but after a few years a precious stone is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are not married, there are still many good heaters in our big family, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some members will press us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They will press us out of our strength and out of our measure.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have been a Christian with two families for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One is small, and the other is larger.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have many pressures from my small family.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But in the big family, the church life, I could not remain for one day without the Lord s mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes I am in a big oven during the day with all the brothers, and at night I go home to be in the little oven.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am happy for so many pressures.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They will produce precious stones for God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today this habitation is just the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the midst of all the heat and pressure we have the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have the tree of life and the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way God is building His eternal habitation.</S>
