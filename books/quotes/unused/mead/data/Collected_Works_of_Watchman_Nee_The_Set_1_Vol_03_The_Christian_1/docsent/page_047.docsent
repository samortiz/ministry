   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR JUDGMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we have seen the difference between salvation and reward, we come to a related question, that is, judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without judgment, how does one know who is saved and who is unsaved?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without judgment, how does one know who will receive the reward and who will not?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are four judgments in the Bible:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 The judgment of the Lord Jesus on the cross as a substitute for sinners;</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2 The judgment of the saints before the judgment seat of Christ for works;</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>3 The judgment of the Gentiles on the earth Matt 25:31-46 ;</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>4 The judgment of the dead Rev 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of these four judgments, one has transpired; three are yet to come.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If anyone believes in the Lord Jesus as his Savior, the effectiveness of the judgment of the Lord Jesus on the cross for sin will come upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus the problem of his sin will be solved eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He will be saved, have eternal life, and be freed from the condemnation of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To have no condemnation John 3:18; Rom 8:1 in the original language means to be free from judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that whoever believes in the Lord Jesus as the Savior will be freed from the judgment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because the Lord Jesus already became his substitute on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the saints are freed from the judgment of sin, the Bible says that the saints still will be judged 2 Cor 5:10; Rom 14:12; Matt 25:14-30; 1 Cor 3:11-15; etc. . What is this judgment? This judgment is not for salvation or perdition because that was solved on the cross already.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to 1 Corinthians 3:15, this judgment, whatever it entails, does not result in eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What kind of judgment is this then?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the judgment of the saints' conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The judgment of the cross terminates our living as a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The judgment before the judgment seat of Christ terminates our living as a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The judgment before the judgment seat of Christ judges all our conduct since the time of our believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The sins that we have confessed will not be brought up again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some people work for the Lord faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They suffer afflictions, forsake all things, and do everything for the Lord and for no other purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not seek to please man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather they seek only to do the will of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such people will receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They will be co-kings with the Lord Jesus and will receive unspeakable glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How marvelous this will be!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord's heart will be overjoyed and we will receive the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us pursue after this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At times, some are defeated, but since they have once confessed their sins, the precious blood has already cleansed them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As they repent and seek again to follow the Lord in the narrow way of the cross, they will still receive a reward from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some, though they have not sinned, have works like wood, hay, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They seek men's pleasure, strive for the outward things, and work with a double purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They will suffer loss and will be deprived of the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some, though saved, still commit many sins after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These sins are never confessed and repented of before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result, such a one will not only lose a reward but will receive punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although his eternal salvation cannot be shaken, he will receive severe punishment and chastisement from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Revelation 1 3 shows us the attitude of the Lord Jesus Christ in judging the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The conditions in these three chapters are a precursor of the condition before Christ's judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The judgment of the Gentiles will depend on the way they treat the Jews during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The time will be at the end of the great tribulation and when the millennium will be about to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Revelation 16:12-16 and 19:11-21 speak of this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The judgment at the white throne is the fourth judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Revelation talks about judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we understand these four judgments we will understand the judgments in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NUMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God uses a great deal of numbers in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To those who love the Word of God, the numbers are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has no intention for man to use the numbers for curious talk but to use them for His children's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If God the Father sees fit to put numbers in the Bible, yet His children pay no attention to them, they will undoubtedly suffer loss in their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people think that attaching meaning to the numbers in the Bible is simply a far-fetched interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But to those who are godly and believing, nothing happens by accident; God's hand is behind everything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since it pleases God to use many numbers in the Bible, we should not be foolish and ignore their significances.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The book of Revelation uses numbers more than other books in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before we can rightly interpret the book, we must understand the meaning of the numbers in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The numbers from one to seven are the base of all numbers in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All other numbers depend on these seven for their meaning and explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many realize that seven is the number of completion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eight is not an independent number.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Seven days make a week; eight is the number of the beginning of a new week.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All numbers greater than seven are the multiples or the sum of these seven numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, ten is the product of two and five; twelve is the product of three and four; forty is the product of five, two, and four.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Other numbers go by the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Their meanings depend on the numbers up to seven and how they are multiplied and added.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now let us consider several numbers.</S>
