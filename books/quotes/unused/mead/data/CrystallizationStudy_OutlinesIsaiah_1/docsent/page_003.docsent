   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The age of grace is the age of the new creation; the work of God in the age of grace is to produce the new creation John 1:16-17; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The coming age will be the age of restoration Matt 19:28; Acts 3:21: In the coming age God will neither create nor produce the new creation; rather, He will do the work of restoring the old, fallen creation Rom 8:20-22.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A restoration will be brought to all things; in this restoration death will be limited, and there will be abundant life and much praise and rejoicing Isa 65:18-25.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the age of restoration, the entire universe will be changed from the old to the new; then there will be the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem v. 17; 66:22; Rev 21:1-2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isaiah prophesied concerning the age of restoration Isa 2:2-5; 11:1-10; 61:4-9 ; chapter 35 is a marvelous picture of restoration.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s intention in His economy is that Christ be everything; therefore, it is crucial for us to see that God wants nothing but Christ and that in the eyes of God nothing counts except Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>16-17; 3:4, 10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because Christ is the centrality and universality of God s move, the book of Isaiah reveals many aspects of Christ for the fulfillment of God s economy 6:1-8; 22:22; 53:5, 10b-12; 54:5; 55:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 4:2 there is a pair of aspects of Christ the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth; the Shoot is in comparison to the Fruit, and Jehovah is in comparison to the earth: God is eternal, and man came from the earth; the Fruit of the earth refers to a man made from dust Gen 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ as God came from eternity, but as man He came from the earth, so He is the Shoot of Jehovah and also the Fruit of the earth.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sprouting and development of God in Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah are for the expression of all the riches of divinity in Christ s humanity, that is, for the rich attributes of divinity to be developed into the virtues of Christ, the God-man, in His humanity Eph 3:8.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The incarnated God, in His divinity, will be the beauty and glory of God s chosen people in the day of restoration Isa 4:2a: Our God with His divine nature is our beauty and our glory 60:1, 9, 13.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because Christ lives in us, we are partakers of the divine nature; in this sense, we are not only human but also divine, and the divine nature is our beauty and our glory Gal 2:20; 2 Pet 1:4.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Isaiah 4:5-6 there is a second pair of aspects of Christ a covering canopy of glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace: The second pair is the issue of the first pair and is produced by the first pair: Because Christ is the Shoot for God s new development and the Fruit for God s reproduction, He has the divine beauty and glory with the human excellence and splendor; therefore, He can be a canopy covering us and a tabernacle overshadowing us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2, 5-6.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our Jesus is the God-man, the One who is both divine and human; as the God-man in His divinity and humanity, He, the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth, is a covering canopy of the divine glory and an overshadowing tabernacle of grace in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The God-man, Christ, is a canopy, which is the covering glory of Christ in His divinity that covers all the interests of Jehovah God on earth v. 5.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The overshadowing tabernacle is the God-man, Christ, in His humanity with His grace, as illustrated in 2 Corinthians 12:9; this is Christ as our overshadowing protection and defense Isa 4:6; John 1:14.</S>
