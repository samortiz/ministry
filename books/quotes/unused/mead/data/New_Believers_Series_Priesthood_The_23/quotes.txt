[1]  This ministry consists of a group of people wholly separated from the world to serve God.
[2]  Beginning from the book of Genesis, we find God calling men to be priests.
[3]  According to the revelation of the Scripture, God's purpose is not to have only one or two persons as His priests.
[4]  His purpose is to have all His people as His priests.
[5]  God charged Moses to speak to the Israelites, saying, "Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation" Exo 19:6 .
[6]  God had appointed them to be priests, but even before they were able to be His priests, they became priests to the golden calf.
[7]  While Moses was on the mount, God told him to go down.
[8]  After the incident of the golden calf, God immediately told Moses that from that time on the nation of Israel could no longer be a kingdom of priests.
[9]  From Exodus until the time of the Lord Jesus on earth, no other tribe could function as priests except the tribe of Levi.
[10]  They could not even come to God to confess their sins; they had to confess them through the priests.
[11]  The people had to come to God through the priests, and God had to approach His people through the priests.
[12]  The same word can be found in Revelation 1:6, which says, "And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father."
[13]  A. God Honoring Us by Calling Us to the Priesthood
[14]  If God in heaven has called us to be His priests, we should be on our knees before Him to receive His calling.
[15]  We can no longer allow priests to stand between God and His children; we can no longer accept an intermediary class.
[16]  They cannot be the only ones through whom God speaks or the only ones through whom we approach God to settle spiritual matters.
[17]  Everyone who considered himself a child of God was a priest of God.
[18]  There is something I would like all of us to see: In this end time, God is doing a work of recovery; He is taking the way of recovery.
[19]  I believe God is leading all of His children up to this position in this last age.
