   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lion of the Tribe of Judah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Revelation 5:5 Jesus Christ is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This title signifies Christ as the triumphant King.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All living creatures are under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>None can subdue Him; rather He subdues everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first time I saw a lion in the zoo I was afraid the fence was not strong enough to restrict that bold, triumphant creature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nothing and no one can subdue our Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is not only a Lion but also a Lamb 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To Satan and all the enemies Christ is a Lion, but to us, the redeemed ones, He is a Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Are you afraid of a lamb?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may be afraid of a lion, but you would feel loving toward a lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To us the Lord Jesus is a Lamb, a redeeming Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To think that in eternity on God's throne there will literally be a lamb with four feet and a tail is not the proper way to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I remind you again, Revelation is a book of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Universal Woman and the Man-Child</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The universal woman in Revelation 12 is clothed with the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On her head there is a crown of twelve stars, and under her feet is the moon v. 1 . Who is this woman? Most fundamental expositors follow the Brethren teaching, that this woman signifies Israel and her man-child signifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, after much studying of the Word, we realized from chapter twelve that this woman is composed of two peoples: those who keep the commandments of God and those who bear the testimony of Jesus v. 17 . The people that keep the law are the Jews, Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The people that bear the testimony of Jesus are the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, to say that this woman signifies Israel is only partially true; it leaves aside the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To say that the man-child born of this woman is Jesus Christ is erroneous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After this man-child is raptured to the throne of God, three and a half years follow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The thousand two hundred and sixty days in 12:6 are three and a half years, which all agree is the period of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Did the great tribulation come right after the Lord's ascension?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It has not come yet!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates strongly that the man-child here is not the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The woman wears a crown of twelve stars on her head.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She is clothed with the sun. and the moon is underneath her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These indicate three categories among God's redeemed people: the Patriarchs, Israel, and the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Patriarchs are represented by the stars, Israel by the moon. and the New Testament believers by the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This woman is therefore a composition of all God's redeemed people, including the Patriarchs, the other Old Testament believers, and all the New Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The man-child is the overcomers of all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through the centuries among God's people a small number have been martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These were the faithful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Right before the great tribulation these martyred saints will be resurrected and raptured to the throne of God.</S>
