   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEATH WITHOUT FEAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Based on what we have said about overcoming death, we do not necessarily mean that our body will never die.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we believe that "we will not all sleep" 1 Cor 15:51 , saying that we will not die is too superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the Bible takes seventy as a general standard for human life, we can hope to live until that time if we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we should never think that we are immortal because we have the Lord Jesus as life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, we know that God often allows exceptions; some die before seventy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our faith can only ask God that we would not pass away before our work is done.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether we live briefly or for a long time, we should not perish like sinners before half of our days are over.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our days should be long enough to finish our work in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then when the end does come, we can depart from the earth in peace by the grace of God, in a way that is as natural as the falling of a ripe melon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Job described this kind of death as "a shock of corn cometh in in his season" 5:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Overcoming death does not necessarily mean escaping death, because God may want some people to overcome it in resurrection just as the Lord Jesus did.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But even though a believer passes through death, like the Lord Jesus, he does not have to fear death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A believer who strives to overcome death simply because he fears and abhors death is already defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can he expect to overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord may decide to completely save us from death by rapturing us alive to the heavens; but we should not ask the Lord to come back soon out of our fear of death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a fear is a symptom that we are already defeated by death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if we die, death is just like walking from one room to another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need for any traumatic pain, anxiety, or fear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Originally, we were men who "because of the fear of death through all their life were held in slavery" Heb 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the Lord Jesus has "released" us so that we do not have to fear it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Its pain, darkness, and loneliness cannot scare us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An apostle who experienced overcoming death told us, "For to me...to die is gain...having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for this is far better" Phil 1:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here is an attitude that sees no trace of fear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is true victory over death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>RAPTURED ALIVE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be raptured alive is the last way to overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, many believers will be raptured alive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 and 1 Thessalonians 4:14-16 teach this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no definite day for the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He could have come back at any moment during the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Believers have the hope of being raptured alive at any time without passing through death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The time of the Lord Jesus' second coming is now closer than before.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, believers today have more hope of being raptured than those in past generations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We do not want to say much here, but we can safely say a few words with assurance: if the Lord Jesus comes back while our generation is still here, would we not be raptured alive?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If so, we should overcome death, not allowing ourselves to die ahead of time so that we may be raptured alive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the prophecy in the Bible, there will eventually be a group of believers who will be raptured without passing through death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their being raptured alive is a kind of overcoming of death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as we live on the earth, we should not say that we may not be those people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, should we not prepare ourselves to overcome death completely?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Believing that we will never die physically is not a superstition, because the Bible gives us this hope.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may die, but it is not a must that we die.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord clearly teaches us: "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day" John 6:54 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But He also says, "This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread shall live forever" v. 58 . He means that among His believers some will die and be resurrected, while others will not pass through death at all.</S>
