The way that the apostles brought in two thousand years ago and the way that the early church took was this way
After receiving light in the Bible before the Lord, we, by the Lord's grace, are willing to recover the lost scriptural way
You may say that this way, from the beginning to the end, was revealed to us in the New Testament little by little in a very clear way
Due to the fact that there is nothing of this new way in our natural concept, we could not discover it from our reading
Concerning those profound things within God's heart, we have no idea, and we cannot understand even after much reading
We need to look to the Lord to grant us revelation and light that we may see the profound things of God in this portion of the Word
The home meetings are for the perfecting of the newly saved ones, for leading them to function in the meetings
As long as something is a part of the body, regardless of whether it is big or small, it has the organic feeling and function
The old way of tradition in Christianity does not pay attention to the Body of Christ, but only to the outward organization
The Body of Christ is a group of people who have repented, believed, and received Jesus as their Savior and life
The percentage that we are organic is not that much; we are still lacking the organic expression of the life functions
It was in this kind of setting that we were redeemed, regenerated, and received the life of God and the Holy Spirit
Peter, Paul, and the many apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, were all this kind of persons
These gifted ones the apostles prophets evangelists shepherds and teachers are perfected by the Head Christ these are needed by the Body
There are also shepherds and teachers who are those taking care of people, shepherding people, and teaching people
Brothers and sisters, the new way is a way which allows the gifted ones in the church to perfect all the saints
Like our human body, it is not by outward organizational means that the Body is sustained, but by the inward organic function of each part
For many years in the past, the way we preached the gospel was for the church to set the date for a gospel campaign
The brothers and sisters were burdened to endeavor to invite relatives, friends, neighbors, schoolmates, and colleagues
You cannot say that this way is not a right way or a useful way, since there is such a gathering of people for the gospel from the Bible
If you study the Bible carefully, you will see the basic thought in gospel preaching is to go to where the sinners are
There are over one thousand churches around the world, and most are practicing this way of preaching the gospel by visiting
Even some other Christian groups have been influenced by us and are practicing preaching the gospel by visiting
We must believe that the Holy Spirit is with us, and we must speak the Lord's word to people, sentence by sentence, by the spirit
Some people are very rough with us at the start, but after our preaching they not only repent, pray, and believe, but also are baptized
No matter how people revile you, your countenance is not changed, and no matter how much your head is hit, it is not broken
We need to go to bring salvation to people's homes, just as the Lord Jesus brought salvation to Zaccheus' home
In our preaching the gospel by visiting, we bring people to believe in the Lord and we baptize them; then they become new believers
As we go back to the Bible, we see that immediately after people are saved and baptized, we need to meet with them in their homes
Use ten home meetings to work into him the basic Christian knowledge and experience in order to lay a good foundation of life
Change the home meeting frequency to once a week, or at least once every other week, caring for him this way for as long as a year
There will be the opportunity for all to manifest the organic ability in each one by speaking for the Lord and testifying for the Lord
There is the breaking of the bread to remember the Lord, the learning of the truths, as well as the mutual fellowship and sharing
We all can also have a higher enjoyment, hear more complete messages, and obtain a more perfect edification and comprehensive building up
We ought to inspire the ones we are helping, to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord in the district meetings
All the saints in the meeting can function organically speak to supply one another and edify mutually and thus build up the Body of Christ
Grouped in threes, with different ages and sexes, they would coordinate to preach the gospel by visiting people
Thirty saints, divided into ten teams, can in one year bring a hundred and twenty people to be saved, which is more than the original number
Even if we figure that two out of four will be lost, eventually there will be sixty remaining out of the one hundred and twenty
If we all do this willingly, faithfully, and with much labor, the church in Taipei will be on the track of the organic way
The whole church life will be organic and not organizational, and it will belong to all the saints, not to just a few
If there is not the adequate supply to our physical life, it will be difficult for us to walk, not to mention to bear burdens
Due to the inability of man to keep the laws by himself, there is Christ as grace to supply us in the New Testament
There is no doubt that God requires of us, but God does not expect us to fulfill this requirement by ourselves
He comes into us to be our life in order to supply us so that we can meet His requirements and fulfill His eternal purpose
There is a portion of the Word in 2 Peter 1 which is most fitting to the need of those who enjoy the Lord in the church life today
In order for us to enjoy this life and live out this godliness, He has also given to us the precious and exceedingly great promises
These promises tell us that although the requirements of our God are so high, He wants to completely fulfill them within us and upon us
What had formerly been words of requirement in the Bible was all changed in my reading to become words of supply
Life and godliness include sanctification, perfection, spirituality, overcoming, and all the requirements in the Bible
Through this faith, all the things related to life and godliness will become reality to us, and we will be led into this reality
Similarly, what delivered Noah and his eight family members from the destruction by the flood was not Noah himself, but the ark
The ark delivered them from the judgment of the flood; yet they themselves were inside enjoying God's preparation
We still try to use our own efforts and schemes, yet the result is that we bring to ourselves burdens and difficulties
As long as we are contacting Christ, it does not matter where we are or what time it is, because He belongs to us
Corinthians 10:4 says that the Israelites in the Old Testament had a living rock following them, which was Christ
Every time when we feel heavily burdened, we need to listen to the Lord's voice saying, 'My grace is sufficient for you
It is due to our weaknesses that the Lord's power has the ground to manifest itself and we are able to enjoy His power
Concerning material things, the Lord said in Matthew 6, 'Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat?
If a person knows only to work, without adequate rest, then it will not be too long before he cannot make it anymore
The church life not only gives people joy and satisfaction, but also uplifts the standard of morality of human beings
God has already granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that we may escape the corruption that is in the world by lust
All we need is to live in His promises and do our duty, restfully and stably enjoying His presence and His divine essence
These are the precious promises we received from the Lord and also the living we ought to have by the divine power of God
From this we can see that the Bible, from the Old Testament to the New, has the thought that God is breath to us
The religionists consider God as someone great and unlimited; they only take God as an object of worship, as someone supreme and grand
Romans 10:8 says that this resurrected Christ has become the living Word, being near to us, even in our mouth and in our heart
Today many people have a wrong view of God and misunderstand God, thinking that God is so great that He is unapproachable
The woman said, 'Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men should worship'
We human beings can have God, not merely to be our outward help and support, but to enter into us to be our life and supply
A person can live without eating or drinking for a few days, but he will be finished if he does not breathe for even a few minutes
Although it is simple to have God, yet it is miraculous that God enters into man to be his life and life supply
A Christians normal living should be one that is fitting in every situation and every place to a certain point he is neither poor nor rich
The Bible shows us that the living of the man created by God is one that has obligation, responsibility, duty, and enjoyment
His obligation, responsibility, and duty are for his existence, and his existence should be a kind of enjoyment
Our money and our time should also have proper arrangement and balance, affording help to man's need and God's business through proper means
Only the life of Christ and His precious promises can cause us to live this kind of normal yet miraculous living
After my graduation, the Lord caused my living to be not too poor nor too rich, but just right for serving the Lord
Before He came out to minister at the age of thirty, He was growing up in a despised city, in a carpenter's home
As long as the Lord's supply within us is adequate, our church life will surely be proper and satisfying, and time will not become a problem
In order for us to maintain our status and function as salt and light, we must practice the church life in a good way
At any rate, we have to eat the spiritual food every morning before the Lord so that our spirit is filled every day
In order to be able to do this continuously throughout the year according to a schedule and a plan is not an easy thing
May we all rise up to cooperate with the Lord to receive the burden to push this matter that we may do this continuously
The passage that we have read is the second of the two important prayers of the Apostle Paul in the book of Ephesians
When we speak of the church life, we must understand it to such an extent and enter into the reality in such a way
Not only are we the regenerated believers of Him, but the whole created human race, the house of Israel, and even the angels are all of Him
The result is that we are strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth
Through the operation of the Triune God, they have lived out in a practical way this portion of the word in Ephesians 3
Among the nations, between individuals, in society and the homes, everyone is striving and fighting for these things
The result is that we will be able to live the real church life, experiencing Christ and expressing God's riches
He said that God is able to do superabundantly above all that he asked or thought according to the power which operates in the believers
Throughout the ages, countless saints have given up every worldly thing and have chosen to take this way as a result of seeing this vision
In this universe, this matter will surely see its ultimate consummation, which is the New Jerusalem, the testimony of God in eternity
Tonight, we want to consider the relationship between the working saints and the new way in the Lord's recovery
The new way is not merely a matter of preaching the gospel and bringing sinners to believe in the Lord and be saved
It is not a simple matter to bring a large church like the church in Taipei to the proper track of the new way
The evil one means something pernicious, harmfully evil, affecting and influencing others to be evil and vicious; it is personified
When a man has an empty stomach and is hungry, he will surely be weak; there is no possibility that he will be strong
In order to occupy man, Satan uses religion, culture, commerce, entertainment, and other things to put man under a system
The present need in God's economy is not only of the young and the middle-aged saints, but of the saints who are the fathers as well
The saints who are the fathers know the Christ who was before all things, who also is the Word of life who was there in the beginning
In time, in place, in circumstance, in grace, and in the church, the grace of the Lord has nurtured and perfected us
Three and a half years ago, there were those who wanted to serve in the church in Taipei, but the opportunities were few
At present, there are approximately ten thousand saints who monthly attend the home meetings, small group meetings, and district meetings
Since we began in 1986 preaching the gospel by knocking on doors, there are twenty-five thousand others who have not yet been brought in
If we add these dormant ones and the ones who have not yet been brought in, there are thirty-five thousand who need care
If you do not know how to take care of a home meeting or a small group meeting the church has the direction and everyone can learn together
Recently, many brothers and sisters who have been saved for only half a year have been standing up to prophesy in the meetings
The practice of the new way also affords the saints a chance to let out a breath of life, which is their desire to serve the Lord
The only problem is that in the past few years we have knocked on too many doors and have saved too many people
All who have worked in the communities know that it is not easy to conduct a home meeting or a small group meeting
Because Moses knew Jehovah, who was simply Christ, he refused by faith to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
Sin occupies a great part of the world, and sinful things are also joined to the enjoyment of the lusts and the flesh
He made an estimation and reckoned that no matter how noble and precious the treasures of this world are they cannot be compared with Christ
The holy bargain strike- The fragment for the whole- All men and all events alike Must serve the ransomed soul
All things are yours when you are His, And He and you are one; A boundless life in Him there is, Whence doubt and fear are gone
Not only did Moses refuse to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter through faith, but he also left Egypt by faith
By faith Moses 'left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he was steadfast as seeing the invisible One'
He reckoned 'that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us'
He counted all things that were gains to him now as loss because all those things which were gains to him result in the loss of Christ
Because of such a knowledge of Christ, he was able to count it a matter of excellency to have the knowledge of Christ
He had a very good background, he had received a high education and enviable positions, and he had a bright future
In all things, great or small, and especially in his daily living, he was seen by others to be a man in Christ
Today, we are too familiar with grace and have therefore overlooked the law and have even despised the value of the law
Before Moses brought in the law, not one patriarch could describe God in a way that could compare with the way the law did
It was Moses who built a habitation for God on earth among the Israelites, making it possible for God to dwell with His people
After six days, the Lord took Peter, James, and John to a high mountain, and He was transfigured before their eyes
He knew that though he was rejected by earthly men, God would save him into His kingdom, because he had given up the world to gain Christ
If we are busy day in and day out all day long here on earth, in the end what eternal value will there be to our labor?
The only result that is everlasting is our sacrifice for the Lord in bringing others to salvation and helping them to be perfected
The reason for their reward was that they cared for others, bringing them to salvation and gaining them for the Lord
Truth here refers to the real things concerning Christ and the church according to God's New Testament economy
Those who are newly saved in the church have been saved recently out of the world; they do not know much about the truth
If the working saints can rise up, such a condition will be manifested in Taipei, that is, there will be a practical oneness seen
To grow up into the Head in all things is to have Christ increase in us in all things until we become a full-grown man
The reason we have to take the new way is that in the old way, it is very difficult for the brothers and sisters to be built up organically
The way in the past of one speaking and all the others listening was to give people food without giving them the organic exercise
Otherwise, even though you may have a strong desire, your outward way of living will eat you up totally and bind you
For this reason, our way of living has to be one that matches our desire to love Him, live for Him, and serve Him
In the world, the thing that worries the mothers the most is that their daughters would not know how to cook after they are married
Paul told us in 1 Corinthians 16 that if any man does not love the Lord, let him be accursed, and that the Lord will surely come and judge
In budgeting your finances, you should offer up what you have in excess according to the prosperity that the Lord has provided you
It has turned from a place of perilous and poor conditions forty years ago to one with peaceful and rich conditions today
Practically speaking, you should consecrate your body and your time according to the way of budgeting we described
When you see your wife losing her temper, you should begin to fellowship with the Lord within to receive His supply
We are not merely coming together for a meeting or to build up a congregation, but are growing together into the Body of Christ
