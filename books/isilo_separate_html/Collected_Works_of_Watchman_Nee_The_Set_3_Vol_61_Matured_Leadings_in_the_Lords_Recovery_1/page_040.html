In the Gospels we find individuals practicing this. In Acts the saints sold their belongings themselves, placed the proceeds at the feet of the apostles, and put them at the disposal of the church. In reality they placed them before the seven deacons (Acts 6:3). Once the church comes in, there is the need of arrangements. But these arrangements are not made by natural men but by men of wisdom chosen by the Holy Spirit. With proper arrangements, things will not be handled rashly. The Holy Spirit will exercise His control in this matter. We request that you write down all that you have on a piece of paper and give it to the church. Let the church decide what to do. Some things need to be sold. Other things do not need to be sold. The church will make the decision. The church asks you to submit a list, not because it wants to claim the items on the list, but to facilitate the responsible brothers in making proper arrangements. You should not keep anything according to your choosing. If the brothers and sisters say that you should keep it, you should keep it. Your two hands have to be empty all the time. After you have handed your possessions over, if the church says that you should sell something, it will return the items to you and ask you to sell them. The teaching in Acts is that all the consecrated ones did the selling themselves. The teaching in the Gospels is also for every individual to do the selling himself. This act of selling affords a very good training to the seller; it is a great lesson to him.</p><p>Let me give another illustration. A brother in Shanghai bought eight hundred mus (a measure of land, equal to approximately 733 square yards) of contiguous farmland in the course of ten years. He spent much time and energy acquiring it. When he handed himself over, he dealt with the land two and three plots at a time because he reckoned that he had acquired them two or three at a time. If I had been the one selling it for him, I would have disposed of the whole property all at once. I realized that this brother was still not firmly persuaded in his heart. He submitted his list of consecration, but his heart was not in it. I asked him to come to me, and I told him to sell his land. He could not part with it and eventually decided to keep it. Eventually, all eight hundred mus were confiscated by the Communists. I am asking you to do the same thing now: Whatever you have built up with your own hands should be sold by your own hands. This is like Abraham being asked to slay his own son. This will teach you a very solid lesson.</p><p>Today many people are like Nebuchadnezzar, who built the great city Babylon with his own hands. They dare not tear down their own building; they want to hand it over to God and let God tear it down. God will never do this, however. He wants us to tear it down ourselves. Abraham obeyed God and offered up Isaac. God wanted Abraham to slay Isaac with his own knife. Isaac was Abraham's son; God did not want to slay Isaac for him. A man does not have many chances in his life to learn such a lesson.</p><p>One sister had a fondness for jewelry, such as pearls and bracelets. She handed them over to the church and asked the church to sell them for her. I told her that the church would not sell them for her but that she had to sell them herself. This was the only way she could be free from money and material possessions. From now on the church will not sell or auction things for the saints.</p><p>When Brother Witness was preparing the building of the meeting hall in Shanghai, many sisters offered their diamonds, rings, jade, etc. Many brothers offered paintings and calligraphies which they had collected. A high price had been paid for these items. They were worth quite much at the time of their purchase, but they could not be sold for twenty percent of their value. Some could not be sold for more than a fiftieth of the purchase price. One diamond worth five thousand dollars was sold for less than five hundred dollars. Another item worth twelve hundred dollars was sold for only twenty dollars. The brothers and sisters who sold their jewelry and paintings began to realize how much they had wasted the money that God had blessed them with. This is the only way we can realize the rapid depreciation of worldly possessions. Only eternal things have eternal value. Only items that have been consecrated to God retain their value. Paintings and calligraphies quickly become cheap. We have to take up the knife and do the killing ourselves. Only by doing it ourselves will we realize how easily we are deceived. This will teach us a lesson to not be so foolish again. This is the only way we can learn. If we invest our hard-earned money into these objects again, we will be the most foolish people. When we hand ourselves over to God, we are building upon an unfailing and unfaltering foundation. Our spirit will no longer be bound, and we will transcend everything.</p><p>When we overcome the bondage of money and material things and we rise above the entanglement of everything, the whole church will rise up to preach the gospel. Now the workers are preaching. When that day comes, the church will be preaching and the church will be serving. There will no longer be just one or two persons serving as full-timers. The whole church will be the Lord's servants. That will be a glorious day. I hope that day will come soon.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
