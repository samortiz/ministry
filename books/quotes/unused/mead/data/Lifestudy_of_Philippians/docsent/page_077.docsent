   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first aspect of the expression of a life that lives Christ is forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians 4:5 says, Let your forbearance be known to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later we shall see that a second aspect is the absence of anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In a life that lives Christ there will be forbearance, but no anxiety, no worry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul considers forbearance and the lack of anxiety as the first two aspects of the expression of a life that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A life that lives Christ is calm, tranquil, peaceful, and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A life of turmoil, on the contrary, is a life that lives Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Forbearance is the most important element of a tranquil life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Forbearance is reasonableness and consideration in dealing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To have forbearance is to deal with others without strictness of legal right.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we would live a calm life, we must have forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Forbearance includes patience and moderation, but goes beyond them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you have forbearance, you will not argue with others, fight with them, or debate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You may have a great deal to say, but you will have patience and moderation in dealing with others and will not say anything in response to provocation or irritation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose a group of sisters live together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The most precious sister will be the one who is the most forbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When difficulties arise, she will be calm and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if others offend her, she will not retaliate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sisters who lack forbearance, however, may easily react when they are offended.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In their living there is no calm, no tranquillity, no moderation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A proper Christian life is a life of calm.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To live such a life means that we do not argue with people or fight with them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Forbearance is versus rivalry and vainglory, two negative things mentioned by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Forbearance is also opposed to murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some saints are given to the pursuit of rivalry and vainglory, whereas others are given to murmurings and reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever we have rivalry, vainglory, murmurings, and reasonings, there is no calm, no tranquillity, no forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From my experience I have learned that the first aspect of a life which lives Christ is tranquillity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we live Christ, we shall not argue with others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We shall know what is the right time to speak even a calm word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even a calm statement made at the wrong time can contribute to an argument.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you reply as soon as someone offends you, your word will not be one of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If someone is angry with you, it is best not to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Exercise forbearance and wait for the right time to utter a calm word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is especially important for married brothers and sisters to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If your husband or wife is argumentative, be careful about the way you speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It may be wise not even to call on the Lord aloud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a calling may stir up trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of speaking outwardly, calm yourself, call on the Lord inwardly, and wait until the situation is tranquil before you say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is easy to teach this, but it is quite difficult to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To live in this way requires grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a brother s wife is angry with him, it is very easy for him to be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He may bristle with anger, and his emotions may boil over.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At such a time it is extremely difficult to calm down and be tranquil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this, we need the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It takes much grace to be forbearing in this kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if we exercise to be calm by the Lord s grace, the atmosphere will eventually become tranquil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then there will come a proper time to speak a calm word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have wondered why after covering such profound matters in the first three chapters, Paul says in 4:5, Let your forbearance be known to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Compared with what Paul has already covered, forbearance seems to be a secondary matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, in a very practical way, forbearance is a test of whether or not we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 4:5 Paul also says, The Lord is near.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many readers of Philippians take this as a reference to the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not say that this does not refer at all to the coming of the Lord; however, I believe that it does not mainly refer to His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the contrary, it refers primarily to the Lord s presence with us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord is near; He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we live Him, taking Him as our pattern and counting all things loss in order to gain Him, we sense that He is present with us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is near both in space and in time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In space, He is close to us, ready to help; in time, He is at hand, coming soon.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since the Lord is near, what need is there for us to be troubled and stirred up?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we live Christ, knowing that He is near, we should let others know our forbearance, our moderation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Again I say, this is the first aspect of the expression of a life which lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Be assured that whenever you live Christ, you will show forth such a forbearance, such a moderate and tranquil attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But when you are striving in rivalry for vainglory or when you are murmuring or reasoning, you do not have this forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This lack of forbearance proves that you are not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The first test of our living Christ is whether or not we express forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul had no intention to be like Confucius in teaching us to be patient and to bear difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The factor which motivated him to write these verses was his desire to show the expression of a life that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, in 4:5-9 we see a picture of a life that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we are living Christ, we should let others know our forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They should see that we are calm, tranquil, and moderate and that nothing can disturb our inward calm.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, when we are not calm, we surely are not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then in our experience the Lord is not near.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Instead of calm, we may have anxiety, which destroys our tranquillity and causes us to lose the inward peace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whenever we lose our tranquillity, we are unable to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is not possible to fight with others or to argue and at the same time to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Living Christ requires absolute tranquillity, absolute calm.</S>
