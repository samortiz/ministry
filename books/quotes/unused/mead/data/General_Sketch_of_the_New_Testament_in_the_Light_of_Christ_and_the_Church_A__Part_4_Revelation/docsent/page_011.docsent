   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX THE SEVEN SEALS Scripture Reading: Rev 6 9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Revelation there are four big sevens the seven churches, seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These four sevens are the composition of the entire book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapters we saw the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now chapter six begins to speak of the second seven, the seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the time that this book was written, the church and in particular John, its writer, were under the persecution of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation speaks of the Roman Empire and of the Caesars, but even if the writing had fallen into the hands of a Caesar, it would not have been understood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is because John wrote this book in a way that can be compared to a jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, unless we have spiritual understanding, we cannot understand its contents.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because we have the spiritual wisdom today, we can understand Revelation and put the puzzle together to give us a clear picture.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please refer to The Chart of the Seventy Weeks and the Coming of Christ, with the Rapture of the Saints at the beginning of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1940 I spent many days to compose this chart, and since that time I have labored in the Lord to improve it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This chart helps us to see the sketch of Revelation, putting together the jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Without such a chart it is difficult to understand this book.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NUMBER SEVEN</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The number seven in the Scriptures is always composed in one of two ways: four plus three or six plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first seven mentioned in the Scriptures is in the first two chapters of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The number seven there is composed of six plus one, six days with another day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls in Revelation are composed both of four plus three and six plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The number four signifies the creatures, as represented by the four living creatures, while the number three represents the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Four plus three signifies an improvement from the creature to the Triune God, while three plus four indicates a degradation from the Triune God to the created things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls are composed of four plus three, indicating improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are arranged as three plus four, indicating degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first three churches form one group, and the last four form another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the first three epistles, for example, the Lord says, He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches, and then He gives a promise to the overcomers 2:7, 11, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the last four epistles, the Lord first gives a promise to the overcomers and then says, He who as an ear vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>26-29; 3:5-6, 12-13, 21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that in the churches many things are degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, they need the Lord s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Due to the Lord s judgment, there is a real improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without the Lord s judgment, the things in the hands of man always degrade, but due to God s judgment, there is an improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Seven is also composed of six plus one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Six signifies man, since man was made on the sixth day, and one represents the unique Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, six plus one signifies the created man plus the Creator, which is an improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The number twelve in the Bible is composed not with six but with four multiplied by three.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Twelve signifies that God and man, man and God, are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the age of the church there is seven, signifying God plus man, but in eternity there will be twelve, signifying God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Addition turns into multiplication to produce twelve, the mingling of God with man in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE FIRST FOUR SEALS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE GOSPEL, WAR, FAMINE, AND DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first four seals are represented by four horses 6:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first horse is white, the second is red, the third is black, and the fourth is pale.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Each of the four horses carries a rider.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is easy to see that the rider of the second horse is the personification of war.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In war, people are killed, so this horse is red, which is the color of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The rider of the third horse is also not a person; he is the personification of famine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He holds a balance in which wheat and barley are weighed, indicating a great shortage of food, and the oil and wine should not be harmed because they are precious during a famine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This famine is due to war.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fourth rider is death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Famine follows war, and death follows famine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Due to the lack of food, there is famine and pestilence, which cause many to die.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus the fourth rider is also not an actual person but a personification.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we must find out who or what the first rider is.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Most Bible expositors are of two opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One school says that the rider is Antichrist, while the other school says that the rider is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Both interpretations are against the principle in this chapter, because the other three riders are not real persons but personifications.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to be consistent, the first rider must also be something personified.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The rider of the first horse is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the gospel of peace, the rider carries a bow in his hand with no arrow, for the arrow has been shot on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the cross the arrow hit the enemy, Satan, and defeated him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now the victory has been won.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we read this portion carefully, we will see that the four horses do not run one after the other.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, this is a four-horse race; all the horses are running at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Immediately after the ascension of Christ, these four matters began to run like horses in a race.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to history, as soon as Christ ascended, the horse of gospel preaching started to run.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Simultaneously, war proceeded, followed by famine and death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These four horses encompass all the events that have transpired in human history since the day of Pentecost, including military, political, financial, and educational matters.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Not one matter is not included in these four horses.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Without these four horses, there is a big gap in the scriptural prophecy of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If the four-horse race will occur in the future, as expositors such as J. N. Darby taught, there would be no prophecy telling us what would transpire from the time of the Lord s ascension until the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We would know only the ascension of the Lord followed by the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Darby held the view that even Revelation 4 takes place after the church is taken from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This view, however, does not fit the context of these chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, the four horses in chapter six give us a picture of what happens from the Lord s ascension to the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everything that has happened on the earth among the human race is included in these four horses.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Commerce, for example, is related to the third horse.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The big corporations today are not doing a great work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In principle, they are still saying, a choenix of wheat for a denarius and three choenixes of barley for a denarius v. 6 . They are producing bread for eating according to the principle of commerce.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the same way, the military establishment is working for the second horse.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These four things the preaching of the gospel, war, famine, and death are four horses running a race, and they are still here with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Lord is very wise in giving us this picture as a full history of the human race from the time of Christ s ascension to the beginning of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>On what horse are we?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to say that we are on the first horse, the preaching of the gospel of peace, which goes forth conquering and to conquer.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to preach the gospel; we must not stop the white horse.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We do not care about bread, related to the third horse, and we are not afraid of the second or fourth horse.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We are with the first horse, the preaching of the gospel as the victorious rider, the overcoming one.</S>
