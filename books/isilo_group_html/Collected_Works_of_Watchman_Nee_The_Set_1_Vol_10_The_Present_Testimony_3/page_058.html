Concerning Listening to a Message</H2><P>The same is true in regards to listening to a message. When someone preaches something that is different from our belief and practice, we should ask God if his speaking is really improper. If his speaking is not improper, then are we improper somewhere? If we can learn humbly before God, our hearts will be proper. Consequently, even though our thoughts may be improper at times, our minds will not be improper all the time. However, if our motives are not proper and we only want to argue, we will always be able to find a couple of verses to oppose the truth taught by others. Many Christians study the Bible like a lawyer studying a law book; their purpose is only to defend their own case. Therefore, it is their motive that is corrupted first, not their mind. They first have a tendency to covet in their heart; then their mind and whole being are dragged into the peril of covetousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Concerning Reading the Bible</H2><P>Among our brothers and sisters, is there anyone whose mind cannot understand the Bible? I would say the reason we do not understand the Bible is that our heart is improper. The Spirit will guide us into all truth. I often wonder why some people understand the Bible so poorly. The reason is that they are improper in the inclinations of their heart. Perhaps they are too subjective. As a result, their nous cannot receive the light of God's Word. The heart becomes corrupted, and the nous follows. If the heart is not calm and balanced, the mind will become corrupted. Someone said that Eve did not fall because she ate the forbidden fruit, but because her motive was not proper in the beginning. When she spoke with Satan, her heart was dissatisfied with God and already corrupted. Soon after, Genesis 6 says that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil continually. The nous becomes corrupted after the heart has been corrupted.</P><P>One brother in the West said that before Eve ate the forbidden fruit, she had fallen already. When she added the words "neither shall ye touch it" in her conversation with Satan, her heart was not proper. By Genesis 6, God pronounced every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart to be only evil continually. First, the heart is improper; second, man is alienated from the life of God; and last, man's imagination and thoughts become totally evil. Any Christian who has a proper heart can read the Bible; he can receive God's light from the Bible, he can know God's will easily, and he can receive full grace from God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Concerning Listening to Others</H2><P>If you want to know whether or not a person's heart is proper and his mind is right, you need only talk to him. Whoever can listen well has a good mind. Some Christians' minds are like a wheel; they rotate all day long and cannot listen to what others say to them. Just as the wheel splashes dirt as it rotates, these Christians only raise questions and do not take in the truth. These conditions indicate that a person's mind is improper. The mind is improper because the heart is improper. If a person likes to interrupt the conversation of others, it is also a sign of sickness in the heart. In listening to others, we can sometimes add a few remarks to indicate whether or not we agree, but constant interruption is a sign that there is sickness in the heart.</P><P>If the thoughts that go through your mind swirl around and around all day long, your nous must be sick. In this condition, a person cannot listen to others; he cannot even listen to God's speaking. The root of the sickness is in the heart. A self-righteous, self-confident heart, a heart that believes in its own cleverness, or some prejudice in the heart makes it impossible for one to listen to others. Not being able to listen to others is a sickness of the nous. But the root of this sickness is an improper heart. No matter what we hear, we have to transfer what we hear to our inner being before we can understand it. This work of transferring is somewhat like the work of language translation. For people who do not understand English, words must first be translated into Chinese before they can be understood. This work of "translation" within us goes on quickly. If a man cannot understand what others say, it means that his nous cannot translate. If a man misunderstands what others say, it means that the nous mistranslates. Once I was preaching in a certain place, and I told the people that man is saved not according to work, but according to what Christ has accomplished. There were two Taoists in the audience. After hearing my words, they told others, "He was only exhorting others to do good!" Many people are filled up inside; they cannot receive God's word. If we do not empty out what is inside of us, we will never be able to understand the Word of God. Our heart should be as meek as a child's, ready to be taught before God. We must tell Him, "God, I do not know if what this person says is good or bad, right or wrong. I pray that You grant me judgment, so that I will know what is right and what is wrong." By this, we will understand and see what God wants us to see. Many people think that the inability to understand the truth is due to the sickness of the mind. Actually, the basic cause is the sickness of the heart.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 10: The Present Testimony (3) &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
