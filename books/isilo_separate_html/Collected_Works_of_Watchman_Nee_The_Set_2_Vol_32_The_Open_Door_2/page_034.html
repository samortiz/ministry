First we had seven days of meetings in Yi-Shing Girls' School. This was followed by three days of meetings in Brother Yun's house. All the success goes to the Lord, and all the failures are mine. May the Lord preserve His own work. I intended to go to Szechuan after the conference in Ch'ang-sha, but at the persistent invitation of the brothers and sisters in Hankow, I came to Hankow on the fourth by public bus. We started a conference today. We do not know how many days we can continue meeting; everything depends on the political situation.</p><p>Tang Shou-ling, Hankow, August 7</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>I left Shanghai on July 26. Under the Lord's guidance, I arrived safely in Ch'ang-sha on the afternoon of August 4. Along the way I saw the Lord's wonderful and gracious leading. I could not help but be filled with thanksgiving and praise. Many brothers and sisters have left Ch'ang-sha because of the change in the political situation. But hungry, seeking sisters are still waiting to meet with us here. We have scheduled a conference to begin on the eighth of this month. There will be two sessions each day. The length of the conference will depend on God's leading and the provisions in the environment. We can only say that we will have it as long as we can.</p><p>Sister Tso Fu-ru, Ch'ang-sha, August 6</p><h2 class="head2">Recent Work in Chungking</h2><p>We preached the gospel for four evenings and then conducted a three-day study on the truth of salvation. All were under the Lord's blessing. All the brothers and sisters strove in oneness in prayer, and the outcome was good. In the next few days, we will schedule a baptism. (According to a letter from Chungking on August 11, twenty-four brothers and sisters were baptized on the seventh&mdash;Editor.) The weather in Chungking is tolerable. Some have said that this is the first summer in forty years which has not been that hot. This is also God's grace. I received a letter from my own brother some time ago saying that the Lord rescued him from great danger. Thank and praise the Lord. The brothers and sisters are all safe. Beginning next Tuesday, we will have a Bible study meeting every Tuesday at Brother Chang Tsing-yu's home. I have agreed to be responsible for this meeting while I stay here.</p><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi, Chungking, August 4</p><h2 class="head2">Work in South Fukien</h2><p>Dear brothers in the Lord:</p><p>...I went to Zhuang-Shan in An-Hsi this time. It so happened that it was harvest time, and people were busy. As a result I was able only to have a four-day conference. They hope to start the Lord's table in the near future. Presently, Brother Chang Tung-yuen is working there. Please put him in your prayer. I did not go to the meeting in Ban-Ling, Wu-Keng because of the political unrest there. Presently, Brother Wang You-yi is still there. Please remember them in your prayer. Thank the Lord that Du, Nan-An, has raised up a brother, Brother Hung Deng-an. Now there is a gospel meeting every Lord's Day at his house. May the Lord also raise up some brothers from Du. There is only one sister who loves the Lord; she is living there with her family; the rest are all gospel friends. Some believers who met in Chuenchow have moved to Du, Nan-An, and every Lord's Day they have gospel meetings there. May the Lord raise up His testimony in that place also.</p><p>Brother Han Jin-siu</p><h2 class="head1">WHEREABOUTS OF THE CO-WORKERS</h2><p>(1) Brother Tang Shou-ling went to Szechuan by steamboat after his conference in Hankow.</p><p>(2) Brother Han Fu-shen returned to Chang-Deh.
