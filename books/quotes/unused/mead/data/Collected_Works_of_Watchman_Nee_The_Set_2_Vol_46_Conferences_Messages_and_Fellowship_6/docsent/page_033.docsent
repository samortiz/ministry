   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FOUR THE OFFENSE OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Matt 11:6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does the offense of the Lord refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord said, "Blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me" Matt 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord's offense means that the Lord has done something which we are not pleased with; that is, we do not like what the Lord has done.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may even have a reason for not liking what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our own eyes we should be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What the Lord did or did not do made John the Baptist offended.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>John was not offended by the Pharisees or the publicans; he was offended by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From his stand- point there was a reason for him to be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why was he offended?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He hoped for Israel's restoration as a nation, and he hoped that the Lord would bring in a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first Elijah had gone up to Mount Carmel and had wrought mighty works.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Israel was revived and Elijah's ministry was vindicated, but the second Elijah was put in prison and shortly would be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He sent a message to the Lord because he was offended.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No doubt he thought that the Lord should do something for him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matt 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He wanted the Lord to do something to demonstrate who he was.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet the Lord did nothing to show who he was or to vindicate his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Not being stumbled because of Me" means not being offended by what the Lord does.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may feel that the Lord does not do what we want.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has not done what we feel He should; He does not vindicate us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Are we pleased with the way of the Lord with us?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not a matter of knowing and doing the will of God, but of whether or not we like His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Often we do God's will with much weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We weep because we are offended by the way He does things; we are offended by His ways, His methods, etc., and it seems as if we have reason to be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This has nothing to do with the Lord's dealing with our flesh or our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That dealing is on a far lower plane.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am now speaking of one whose whole heart is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have sought to know His will, wanting nothing for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We want His glory, and yet in many of God's ways we are disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We come to a great difficulty and there is no way out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are ill and we expect Him to heal us, but we are not healed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are weak, but no strength comes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are short of money, but no money comes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems as if God does not come up to our expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When this happens again and again, we are offended by "the offense of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many people are not yet qualified to be offended by the Lord; they fall because of the flesh and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord seems to disappoint them, it is actually they who have been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not being offended with the Lord is the highest form of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Often we feel that the Lord must step in to take care of His testimony, and that His honor and faithfulness are at stake.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet He will not come in. God led the children of Israel through the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After coming out of Egypt, they were pursued and shut in by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There were mountains behind them as well as to the right and to the left of them; furthermore, there was the sea in front of them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then God opened a way through the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we get to a place where we are shut in, we expect God to open a way through the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, many times He does not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The prison gates do not open; the money does not come; the situation is not dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here comes the test.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who love the ways of the Lord can look up and say, "You were not pleased for us to die in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But if it pleases You that we die near the Red Sea, so be it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether or not the Red Sea opens, we are content and glad."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Madam Guyon said, "I believe God more than His work."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even though God does not seem to keep His promise, we believe Him anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not being offended in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When there is an utter consecration and we give ourselves for His service, we expect God to do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have such a consecration, we have a great expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we are not up to that point, we can explain away everything on the ground of our weakness or because we were wrong or mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But when we are at the point of utter consecration, we expect to see God's deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When God does not come in and we feel that it is our right for God to come in, that is the offense of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who are not offended by the Lord's offense are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We want to be able to say, "If God acts according to His promise, it is good; but if not, it is also good."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One day everything will be explained, and we will see that God was right.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His ways are higher than our ways.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There are many things which we cannot see or understand now.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we stand before the judgment seat, we will not be the only ones who are judged.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Not only will we have to explain many things to the Lord, but also God will have to explain many things to us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There will be many cases when I thought I was right but was actually wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There will also be cases in which God will say, "I was right, but you were also right."</S>
