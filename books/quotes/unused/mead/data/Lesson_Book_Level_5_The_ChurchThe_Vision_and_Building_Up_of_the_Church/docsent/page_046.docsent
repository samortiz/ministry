   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last lesson we talked about the formation of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this lesson we shall consider the establishment of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the difference between the formation and the establishment?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is an important difference between the formation of the universal church and the establishment of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The universal church is not established; rather, it is formed with two categories of elements: all the believers as the extrinsic element and the all-inclusive Christ, the embodiment of the processed Triune God consummated as the all-inclusive, compound Spirit as the intrinsic element.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead of being established, the universal church is formed by these two categories of elements.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The formation is related to the universal church and was accomplished by the Triune God exclusively.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did the choosing, the redeeming, and the regenerating through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only He is qualified to form the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>None of us can help Him in the formation of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The establishment of the churches, however, is different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a job that man can participate in by co-operating with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man not only can participate, man is needed to establish the churches.</S>
