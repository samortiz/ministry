<H1 CLASS=MSG>SECTION ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A SYNOPSIS OF<br>THE BOOK OF REVELATION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INTRODUCTION</H2><P>Revelation is the last book of the entire Bible. It is the consummation of God's revelation and the center of God's word. If the book of Revelation were not in the Bible, the Bible would be a book without a conclusion or ending. There would be no answer to the difficult problems which arise in the other books of the Bible. What a pity it is that God's children have the book of Revelation in their Bible but do not have it in their hearts! They do not read it and are totally ignorant of it. This is why so many people are spiritually weak.</P><P>Revelation is a book that fulfills all of the promises and prophecies. It is a continuation of the Law, the Prophets, the Psalms, the Gospels, and the Epistles, being a completion of all the types and teachings therein. It is the final message given by the Lord Jesus to His church, unfolding the relationship between Himself and His church, His Israel, and His enemies. It is a book on warfare—warfare between Christ and Antichrist and warfare between God and Satan. This book reveals how the saints are in one accord with the Lord and stand with Him to resist Satan and his army. This being the case in the future, how much more true should it be today. May the Lord grant us grace so that we would take a fighting attitude toward the devil on earth today, and that in life, in conduct, and in reality we would resist him. May the Lord intensify our hatred towards Satan.</P><P>Revelation is the most appropriate book to be placed at the end of the New Testament, that is, at the end of the Bible. When we read the Gospels, we are reminded of the future kingdom of God and its glory. When we read the Epistles, our hearts long even more earnestly for the future. The whole Bible seems to point to one future. This directs our hearts toward that end. Revelation concludes all the prophecies. It sets before us the schedule of coming events so that we may know that the day will come when there will be no more groaning of the creation and no more sufferings for the believers. How comforting this will be! Even what the saints experience in this age is now causing them to look forward to the coming of that day. How numerous are the iniquities! How widespread is the violence! The waves are higher, the fire is stronger, and the world worsens day by day! How much the saints look forward to the triumph of righteousness and truth! Revelation speaks forth God's future judgment on sin and unveils the final victory of the lovers of the Lord. See how great the Lord's love is! He gives this book to us for our satisfaction and comfort. He always cares for us!</P><P>The Lord Jesus is the center of God's Word (cf. Luke 24:27 and John 5:39). As such, He is the wonderful key to God's Word. The entire Bible directly or indirectly speaks of Him. Everything the Bible says points to Him and revolves around Him. Apart from Him, no one can understand the Bible. "In the roll of the book it is written concerning Me" (Heb. 10:7). Martin Luther once said: "There is only one book—the Bible, and one Person—Jesus Christ in the world." He is both the outline and the detail of the Bible. If we read Revelation with a heart after Christ, we will see His face and hear His voice in every page. The book of Revelation is not an exception. Here, as in the entire holy book, the person of Christ is the leading figure, and the glory of Christ is the subject. If we cannot see Christ in Revelation, whatever we see is in vain. To be drawn to this book is to be drawn to Christ. How good and beautiful this is! May we have much grace to see more of Christ in every page of this book. What a shame that Bible expositors and readers only care for the judgments, signs, mysteries, and outcomes in this book but have forgotten Christ, our dear Lord. May the Lord cause us to seek and magnify Him with a single heart so that we can learn more to love Him and to be obedient to Him.</P><P>Revelation is a record of the person and the work of the Lord Jesus. In the first chapter there are many titles describing His person—His Godhead. It speaks of His life on earth as "the faithful Witness" (Rev. 1:5). It also speaks of His substitutionary death on the cross: "released us from our sins by His blood" (1:5); "I became dead" (1:18); "the Lamb was slain" (5:6); "worthy is the Lamb who has been slain" (5:12). This book mentions Him as the Lamb twenty-eight times, and every time it reminds us that He died for us because of our sins. How much He loves us (1:5)! This book also records His resurrection; He is "the Firstborn of the dead" (1:5). He is "the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever" (1:18). He is "the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again" (2:8). Because He died and resurrected, God the Father gave Him far more surpassing glory. "He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross. Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father" (Phil. 2:8-11). We see these verses fulfilled in Revelation. In His glory, He receives the praises of the blessed ones, the lauding of the heavenly hosts, and the worship of the creatures. All the hearts of those who love the Lord should exult, because we delight in seeing our Lord receiving glory and honor. The major part of this book speaks of His judgment. "For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son" (John 5:22). Who can stand the wrath of the Lamb? Everything that our Lord has done is proper. Whether He sends grace or wrath, both are full of His goodness and beauty. They stir up our hearts to admire Him unceasingly. How lowly He was in the past! How He was insulted and despised by men! But now how majestic and glorious He is! May the Lord open our eyes to see His venerableness in those horrible judgments! After chapter nineteen we see Him joining with His Bride, defeating His opposers, and the overcoming saints reigning with Him for a thousand years. In the new heaven and new earth we see Him caring for His people. The Lord Jesus is truly the unique, great subject in Revelation. If God's Word is centered on Christ, how much more our speaking should be centered on Him. If God commits all things to Him, how much more should we commit all our walk to Him.</P><P>Besides the person and the glory of Christ, this book also emphasizes the church and the kingdom. However, it does not speak merely of the church and the kingdom, but it speaks of how the church and the kingdom relate to the Lord Jesus. The world, in this book, is under judgment. Hence, there is nothing else recorded concerning the worldly kingdom except that it is judged. As for the church on earth, it does not speak about her particular rights but about her responsibilities. Yet, concerning the glory of the heavenly church and the kingdom, what the Old Testament never mentions is all revealed here.</P><P>In this book God is the eternal Judge. Christ is the Executor. He executes judgment, which begins from the house of God and extends to the world. The Holy Spirit is not merely the "one Spirit" as He is in the other books, but the "seven Spirits" according to His operation in God's administration.</P><P>The title "Revelation" was translated formerly in Chinese by some as "The Book of Hidden Instructions." Actually, this is not a book of "hidden instructions" but a book of revelation. If this were a book of "hidden instructions," then we surely would have no hope of understanding it. However, since it is a book of revelation, we can pray for the instruction of God's Spirit in understanding the doctrines in this book. "Revelation" means an "unveiling." In this book, the Holy Spirit unveils the glory and the person of the Lord Jesus. Again, may He open our eyes even more to see the precious teachings in it.</P>
