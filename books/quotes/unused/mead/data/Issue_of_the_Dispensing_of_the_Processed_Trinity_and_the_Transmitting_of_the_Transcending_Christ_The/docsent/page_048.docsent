   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Body of Christ is the divine constitution of the Triune God with the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 4:4-6 shows us the constitution of the three divine persons with all His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So we have the one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A MINGLING OF</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>DIVINITY WITH HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Body of Christ is a mingling of the Divine Trinity with all His chosen human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AN ORGANISM, BOTH DIVINE AND</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>HUMAN, TO EXPRESS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Body of Christ is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, it is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the other hand, it is human to express the divine and human Christ, who is both the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE FULLNESS OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Body of Christ is the fullness of the all-inclusive Christ, the One who fills all in all Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the book of Ephesians we have these two terms the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fullness is the issue of the riches of Christ 3:8 and the expression of these inner riches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1962, I was invited to speak to a group of people in the Bay Area.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My subject was the riches of Christ issuing in His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They were surprised by this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A number of Christians think that the fullness and the riches are the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the fullness is the issue and the expression of the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A tall, husky American brother has eaten many of the riches of America.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these American riches have been digested and assimilated by him, and he is now the fullness of America, the issue and expression of the riches of America.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to be the same with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should enjoy the riches of Christ until we become the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we are full of the riches, this fullness overflows.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A cup may have water within it, but we cannot see the water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if the cup is filled to the brim with water, it overflows with water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This overflow is the fullness, the expression, of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to be filled with Christ until we overflow with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This overflow is the fullness, and the fullness is the expression.</S>
