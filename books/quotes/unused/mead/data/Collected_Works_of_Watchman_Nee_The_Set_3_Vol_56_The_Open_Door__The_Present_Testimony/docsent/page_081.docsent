   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"I Am..."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we are Christians, and we are saved; God has given Christ to us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we constantly ask for one thing after another; we ask for one, two, three, ten, fifty, one hundred, ten thousand, one million, and ten million things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We think that these individual things are important.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But God shows us that Christ is our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why God's Word shows us that Christ's name is "I Am."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps I should not be speaking so much of this matter outside the Bible; we should consider more of what the Bible says about this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Food</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Gospel of John, the Lord said that He is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We often ask God for food; we think that there is something called food.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are hungry, and we ask God, saying, "Please give us food."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But it is so strange that those who ask for food never receive food.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who ask for food are always hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who beg for food are the ones who are always hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I cannot say that I have been serving the Lord for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But I can at least say that I have been serving Him for some years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During these years, I have never met a person who asked for food and received it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may say, "Does this mean that God's Word is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Does not Luke 1:53 say that He will fill the hungry with good things?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I say, yes, it is true that the hungry ones will be filled with good things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But with what are the hungry ones filled?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to realize that what fills us is not food, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We often feel hungry, and we have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We feel empty and believe that God has food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So we pray and hope to receive food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we do not know how we can get the food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All we know is that we should contact the Lord, believe more, receive more, and enjoy more.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the amazing thing is that when we believe more, receive more, and look to Him more, we do not get the food that we hoped for, yet we are filled.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not receive the food that we expected to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But through our looking to the Lord, and through contacting and receiving Him, we are filled.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's food is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His food is not just food.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has no matters; His food is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Chinese have an idiomatic expression "Chien-pien-yi-lu," which means "one thousand pages of the same thing."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not a good thing to be all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But before the Lord, all the things of God are "one thousand pages of the same thing."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No matter what we are seeking before the Lord, what He gives us is the same Christ; He is "one thousand pages of the same thing."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the One who meets our need; things do not meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Righteousness and Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many times, I can praise and rejoice for one reason only: my righteousness is not my conduct; my righteousness is a person, who is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because the Lord Jesus has become my righteousness, every time I mention my righteousness, I can say that not only do I have righteousness or justification, but I can speak to my Righteousness, praise my Righteousness, and give glory to my Righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Is this not a wonderful word?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may wonder how one can give glory to his righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yes, I often give glory to my Righteousness, because my Righteousness is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My sanctification is not my work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I praise my Sanctification, I am not praising my work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No, I hate my work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet I can say that I praise my Sanctification, because my sanctification is my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Can you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These are not things but the Lord.</S>
