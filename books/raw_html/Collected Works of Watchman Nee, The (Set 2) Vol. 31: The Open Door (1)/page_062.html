Please pray that he would preach the gospel in the power of the Holy Spirit so that many would be saved.</p><p>(4) Please pray for the futures of Brother Chang Jing-yuan, Sister Chang Jing-shia, and Sister Wang Juh-ching.

May the Lord, who gives strength, be with you so that you may fight the good fight and testify to God's gospel of grace, leading more sinners out of darkness into the light. May the Lord's name be glorified, and may the number of saved ones be filled up soon so that the Lord can come back quickly, amen. We are wiring X dollars through the Post Office. X dollars are for the Lord's work. Please give the rest to Brother X. This money was prepared by the Lord for the work and the workers in the remote areas. May you be victorious in the Lord!</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Chen Fang-ching, Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun</p><p>For the brothers in the assembly in the Lord's name in Swatow.</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from<br />Brother Chen Ho-seng, Ho-Kou</h2><p>Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in K'un-ming:</p><p>It was the Lord's arrangement that I come here to live for a long while. When the brothers and sisters pass through Ho-Kou, they need only to notify me, and I will take care of them. By God's grace, I will do my best for anyone. This is God's personal arrangement. Peace to you all.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chen Ho-seng<br />January 15</p>
