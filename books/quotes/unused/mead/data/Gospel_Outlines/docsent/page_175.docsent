   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST Scripture: Phil 3:7-9 The futility of everything Point out that nothing in the universe is really a gain to man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Give concrete examples to show this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example: education, money, and family, etc., may not be gains to man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes the more money a man has, the more harm it does.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you mention the futility of everything, bring in the subject of sickness and death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether one has education, money, or friendship, this cannot be escaped; whether it be parents, wife, children, or others, none can keep sickness and death away.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Conclude that everything is vain and futile.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All things are as dung As far as knowing Christ is concerned, all things are of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So the nature and value of all things are as dung.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Dung is a changed form of food.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Parents, children, reputation, and position are all forms of food, but eventually they become dung.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everything in the world changes, and when it changes it becomes dung.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Dung is the most useless and valueless of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Most Excellent One in the universe Everything in the universe is vain and futile, without weight or value.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only Christ is the Most Excellent One.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is the center of the universe; He is also the reality of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, God is the true value of the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because Christ is the embodiment of God, He is the Most Excellent One.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To know Christ Since Christ is the Most Excellent One, to know Him is the most excellent of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All forms of knowledge are vain; they only add sorrow to man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only the knowledge of Christ is real and solid, and only this will give man real happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So the knowledge of Christ is the most excellent thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The result of the knowledge of Christ Not only will the knowledge of Christ give you the Most Excellent One of the universe, but it will also give you the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Christ your sins will be forgiven and you will be accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Christ you will also obtain the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How to know Christ Recognize that everything is futile, that it is nothing but refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Despise and forsake all the vain and futile things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Receive Christ as your life and Savior.</S>
