<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fourth Way to Hell:<br>Negligence</H2><P>We have seen many ways to go to hell. All of these ways are easy because it is easy to go to hell. Here is a way that is even easier than the previous ways. We need to read one verse to see the easiest way to hell. Hebrews 2:3 says, "How shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation?" If we cannot escape, we will be condemned. Being condemned is to be punished; and being punished is to go to hell. Neglecting God's salvation is another way to hell. I am doing my best to preach the gospel, but you let it go in one ear and out the other. I am speaking earnestly, but you listen carelessly. You neglect. You despise. You have learned that you are a sinner. Yet still you say, "It's none of your business. There is no big difference to me whether or not I am a sinner." You heard that sinners will be punished and will go to hell, but you say, "Whether I go to hell or not, whether I am punished or not, I don't care. Why should I worry about these things in the future?" You have learned that Jesus Christ is the Savior of sinners. He died in the sinner's place and suffered the punishment reserved for them. But you say, "Who cares about Jesus? Whether He died or not, and whether He died in a sinner's place or not, this is insignificant to me. Why should I care about Him? I came here with a peaceful conscience. Why do you preachers have to speak so much to trouble my heart?" You neglect. You disdain. You do not care for anything. Neither salvation nor perdition is important to you. You live carelessly and waste your time foolishly day after day. Hell cannot frighten you, and heaven cannot inspire you. You are really a descendant of Mr. Worryless! The Bible tells you that you cannot escape if you neglect salvation. You need to take heed.</P><P>People often ask me, "What must I do to be saved?" I tell them, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved." When people ask me, "What must I do to perish?" My answer is, "You do not need to do anything!"</P><P>If you want to be saved, you need to believe in the Lord Jesus. Nothing more and nothing less than believing is required. Believe and you will be saved. If you want to perish, you do not have to do anything! You do not need to commit sins, blaspheme the name of Jesus Christ, curse God, do frightening things, commit fornication, be proud, reject Jesus Christ as your Savior, or disobey the gospel! You do not need to do anything: you are qualified to go to hell just as you are. If you want to go to hell, you do not need to do anything. Just a neglectful and disdainful attitude has made you fully qualified to go to hell. You have heard about so great a salvation and know that the Lord Jesus died for your sins, but you pay no attention, giving no heed to these things. It is as if your soul has traversed to some other place. Heaven and hell, salvation and perdition, eternal life and eternal death, spirit and soul, sins, Jesus Christ, His substitutional deathâ€”none of these move your heart. It is as if I am preaching to a wooden or stone statue. You ignore easily what you have heard and are totally indifferent to matters of life and death. While you think that you will not necessarily go to hell, you do not have the assurance that you are going to heaven. You live in a dream world. Since you have despised God's salvation, you cannot escape punishment. Please remember, you do not have to do anything. You do not have to commit any more sins to be qualified for perdition. You are already a man of perdition.</P><P>In Canada there is a waterfall which is the biggest in the world. People often go canoeing in the river upstream from the falls. However, they need to be very cautious in order to keep from drifting over the falls. A plummeting fall will crush both man and boat. Once there was a husky young man who was canoeing alone in the river. At one point he laid the paddle down and started to doze while the canoe drifted down the river. Since he considered himself to be very muscular, he did not anticipate any difficulty in paddling the canoe to a safe place. He assumed that his strength was mightier than the current! Soon, as his canoe had come very close to the edge of the falls, people on the shore noticed the danger that he was in. They began calling to wake him up. When he woke up, he immediately saw the danger. He started paddling with all his strength to bring the boat back to safety. Despite his great strength, however, the current was more powerful, and his canoe drew nearer and nearer to the danger zone. Finally the people on the shore devised a way to save him. They threw a very long rope toward the canoe, hoping that he would grasp the rope so that they could pull both him and the canoe back to shore. Nevertheless, even though he saw the rope, he seemed to be ignorant of the danger and death that faced him. He heedlessly continued to let his boat drift. Two or three times the people on the shore threw the rope near his boat, but he continued to neglect it even though he saw it. Passively he went to meet death. In the end both the man and canoe plunged over the falls to the depths far below, like falling over a tall cliff. Thus this young man lost his life.</P><P>Why did he lose his life? He lost his life because he despised others' deliverance. He neglected their salvation. He was callous to the saving way provided by others. In like manner you need to be careful. Do not live a careless life. Today I have presented God's salvation to you, just as if I had thrown you a rope beside you. I plead that you no longer be foolish and indifferent. For the sake of your soul, receive this salvation promptly and be saved. Why allow yourself to be thrown into hell for eternity? Men are not animals and should not be content to live just for the present age. Why do you so despise the things of the coming age? Please take heed. How can you escape punishment, if you still neglect?</P><P>Those who often hear sermons need to be especially careful. While you are studying in school, you have the opportunity every day to hear God's Word. Or you may be a nominal Christian who has heard sermons for months, years, or even decades. As such a person, you need to pay special attention because I fear that you will go to hell more readily than others. You are used to sermons and have become familiar with the gospel. Nevertheless, you have not believed in the Lord Jesus as your Savior. Since you have heard the gospel repeatedly, you have grown tired of it, saying, "There is not much to it!" Therefore, you despise the message which God has preached to you. You consider the gospel as something trite and hackneyed. You can even utter some words concerning the death of Jesus for man and His salvation for man. Nevertheless, you need to be mindful. Do not neglect God's salvation; otherwise, how will you escape punishment? You may have heard much, but have you been saved? This is a big question. No matter how much you have heard, if you continue to neglect and do not believe, you are in a dangerous position. Please do not fill your head with gospel doctrines so that you can go to hell to tell the people there of your knowledge!</P>
