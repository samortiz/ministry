   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRIUNE GOD BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament reveals that the Triune God became incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Triune God was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that the One who was incarnated was the complete God, the Triune God, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, not merely the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To say that the complete God was manifested in the flesh means that the complete God was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Triune God became a man, lived on earth, ministered, entered into death, conquering and subduing death, and came forth from death in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the Triune God, who became incarnated, who lived on earth, and who entered into death and came out of death in resurrection, has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:14 says, The Word became flesh, and 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The flesh in John 1:14 is the last Adam in 1 Corinthians 15:45.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now the last Adam has become the life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the transfiguration of the incarnated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to realize who it was who became incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The incarnated One was the Triune God to be a man as the last Adam, and this last Adam in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, on the day of His resurrection, He appeared to His disciples, breathed upon them, and said, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who is this Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching His redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to see the vision of the Triune God becoming the last Adam, and the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning this, we do not care for councils, creeds, or traditional theology.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We care only for the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Word reveals that the Triune God became the last Adam, and this last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Praise the Lord that the processed Triune God has reached us as the life-giving Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the day of the Lord s resurrection, the processed Triune God as the life-giving Spirit was breathed into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CLOTHED WITH POWER FROM ON HIGH</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, something further happened.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On that day the ascended Christ poured Himself out as the Spirit economically upon the disciples to be their power, authority, and uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A policeman in uniform has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No matter how powerful your car may be, you still must obey the policeman s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His uniform is a sign of his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the day of Pentecost the one hundred and twenty were clothed with the economical Spirit as their heavenly uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Luke 24:49 the Lord told the disciples to wait until they were clothed with power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they were clothed with power on the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up to speak with authority and power, and the people were subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter could speak with authority because he was clothed with a heavenly uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not take any inaccurate teachings concerning the Holy Spirit in John 20 and Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We praise the Lord for the breathing of the Spirit in John 20 and for the blowing of the Spirit in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The breathing is for life, and the blowing is for move.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, the breathing gives us inner strength, and the blowing gives us outer authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through the breathing and the blowing we are fully equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as the crucifixion is an accomplished fact, so the breathing of the Spirit of life and the blowing of the Spirit of power are also accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should simply believe the report and take the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where is the report?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The report is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What are the facts?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The facts are that the Lord has breathed the Spirit of life into His believers and has blown His Spirit of power upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When some hear about believing the report and taking the facts concerning the essential and economical aspects of the Spirit, they may say, I don t feel that the Spirit of life has been breathed into me, and I don t feel that the Spirit of power is upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If someone said this to me, I would reply, Do you not believe that the Lord Jesus died for you?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Certainly you do, even without feeling anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You believe it because the Bible tells you so.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Likewise, you need to believe that the Lord Jesus has breathed Himself as the Spirit of life into the disciples, including you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You also need to believe that the Lord Jesus has blown Himself as the Spirit of power upon us all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us all believe the facts of Christ s breathing and blowing, just as we believe the fact of His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do we have the Spirit of life essentially?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yes, we have the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How do we know?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We know it because the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do we also have the Spirit of power upon us economically?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yes, we have the Spirit of power upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How do we know?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know this as a fact because the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Praise the Lord for His crucifixion, His breathing, and His blowing!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Praise Him that we know these facts because the Bible tells us so!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>THE OUTWARD FILLING OF THE OUTPOURED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Acts 2:2 says that the wind filled the house where the one hundred twenty were sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Greek word for filled here is pleroo, a word that means to fill inwardly, as the wind filled the house.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verses 3 and 4 say, And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were divided and sat on each one of them; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave them to speak out.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Greek word for filled in verse 4 is pletho also used in 4:8, 31; 9:17; 13:9; and Luke 1:15, 41, 67 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This Greek word means to fill outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>According to its usage in Acts, pleroo denotes to fill a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly in verse 2; and pletho denotes to fill the persons outwardly, as the Spirit filled the disciples outwardly in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The disciples were filled pleroo inwardly and essentially with the Spirit 13:52 for their Christian living, and they were filled pletho outwardly and economically with the Spirit for their Christian ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The inward filling Spirit, the essential Spirit, is in the disciples John 14:17; Rom 8:11 , whereas the outward filling Spirit, the economical Spirit, is upon them Acts 1:8; 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Every believer in Christ should experience both aspects of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Even Christ as a man experienced the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He was born of the Holy Spirit essentially Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 for His being and living, and He was anointed with the Holy Spirit economically Matt 3:16; Luke 4:18 for His ministry and move.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The essential Spirit was within Him, and the economical Spirit was upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>THE JEWISH BELIEVERS BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The outward filling of the poured-out Spirit was the ascended Head s baptizing His Body into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the day of Pentecost, the Jewish believers, the first part of His Body, were baptized; and in the house of Cornelius, the Gentile believers, the second part of His Body, were baptized in the same way 10:44-47 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>By these two steps He baptized once for all His entire Body into the Spirit 1 Cor 12:13 , who is the application and realization of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It was to baptize His Body into Himself that He baptized it into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This was the accomplishment of the baptism in the Holy Spirit promised by Christ, the Head of the Body, in Acts 1:5.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I encourage you to study carefully this matter of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In 2:1-13 we see the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples economically.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>That was the step of baptizing the Jewish believers in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Later, in the house of Cornelius, Christ baptized the Gentile believers in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Through these two steps Christ, the Head, has baptized His entire Body in the Holy Spirit once for all.</S>
