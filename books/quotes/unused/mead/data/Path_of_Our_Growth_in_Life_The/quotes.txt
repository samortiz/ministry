[1]  CONTENTS The Path of Our Growth in Life Reading the Bible Preaching the Gospel Being Identified with the Death and Resurrection of Christ Human Opinions Versus Resurrection Power The Revelation of Jesus Christ Religion or Revelation Service According to Religion or Service According to Revelation Concerning the Church
[2]  It contains nine messages that lead the saints along the path of the growth in life that they may enter into the identification with Christ's death and resurrection, see how human opinion is versus the resurrection power of God, and live and serve by revelation.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE PATH OF OUR GROWTH IN LIFE
[4]  If someone desires to look into the Christian life, he must realize that the Christian life is basically a matter of life.
[5]  Fourth, everyone who lives in the Lord's life not only needs to love the Lord but also should learn to deny himself in an absolute way.
[6]  Fifth, when we love the Lord and put aside our opinions, we will be full of the Lord's feeling.
[7]  Then we will have to follow the Lord and walk according to the sense of life in our spirit.
[8]  NOT BEING INFLUENCED BY THINGS THAT ARE GOOD OR RIGHT
[9]  Sixth, we should never be influenced by what is good or by what is right.
[10]  Question: What is the difference between our natural goodness and the goodness that issues from life?
[11]  Answer: In the Bible, there are good people and bad people.
[12]  After a Christian is saved, the very first thing he needs to do is read the Bible.
[13]  Perhaps some brothers and sisters have been reading the Bible in a solid way, but others may not have read the Bible through even once.
[14]  OUR ATTITUDE IN READING THE BIBLE Having the Right Feeling That We Are Coming before God
[15]  After we have such a realization concerning reading the Bible, we have to pay attention to our attitude.
[16]  I am afraid that some brothers and sisters still do not have a thorough understanding concerning what our attitude should be in reading the Bible.
[17]  Having the Right Attitude Taking the Word of God as Food
[18]  Our attitude when reading the Bible should be similar to the attitude one has when eating breakfast.
[19]  When we eat breakfast, we do not first analyze which food contains a lot of vitamin A, which food has much vitamin B, how many carbohydrates are in the rice and in the buns, and then determine what to eat first and what to eat next.
[20]  Having the Right Method Finding Out the Main Points and Contents of the Bible
[21]  Concerning the method of studying the Bible, we have heard a lot already.
[22]  The preaching of the gospel is a simple commission that the Lord gave us before His resurrection and ascension Matt 28:18-20 .
[23]  Third, we need to be delivered from the self.
[24]  Fourth, we have to be delivered from our self-consciousness.
[25]  HAVING A HEART THAT LOVES THE SOULS OF SINNERS
[26]  This love is not inherent in us but is given by God; neither does this love come from us, but it comes through prayer.
[27]  Question: The brothers do not want us to pay too much attention to man's emotion, but when we preach the gospel, should we put some emphasis on man's emotion and try to touch man's emotion?
[28]  Question: In our preaching of the gospel, we find that it is harder for the local people, the Taiwanese, to receive the gospel than for the Mainlanders, those who migrated from other provinces of mainland China.
[29]  CHAPTER FOUR BEING IDENTIFIED WITH THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
[30]  Romans 8:3 says, "For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh."
[31]  Moreover, Romans 6:5-6 says, "For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves."
[32]  Furthermore, verses 8-11 go on to say, "Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death lords it over Him no more .So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus."
[33]  The revelation is not that if we practice religion properly, we will have no problem; rather, it is that when we are in Christ and have no problem in our relationship with Him, we truly will have no problem before God.
[34]  If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily v. 9 . Christ is God Himself; He is God Rom 9:5; John 1:1 . One day He became flesh and came into the midst of mankind, yet within Him was the very God.
[35]  One day this Christ, who was God yet man, went to die on the cross.
[36]  When we preach the gospel, we usually tell people that the Lord Jesus died for us to bear our sins.
[37]  But what is the meaning of the death of the Lord Jesus?
[38]  The death of Christ, who was God yet man, dealt with all human elements and human problems.
[39]  If among us we still have some religious concepts, this shows that we have not seen the death of the cross we have not seen that we have been identified with the Lord in His death, that we have been crucified with Christ, that we have been executed in Christ, and that we are finished.
[40]  CHRIST WITH HIS DEATH AND RESURRECTION BEING COMPLETE SALVATION
[41]  When we see and know that it is no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us, then when we encounter a certain matter, we will test ourselves and ask if we are on the cross or if we have come down from the cross.
[42]  Matthew 16:15 records that the Lord asked the disciples, "Who do you say that I am?"
[43]  Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . Then Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" v. 17 . Following this, the record in verses 21-24 tells us: "From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised.
[44]  Only when we see Christ will we be able to see the revelation of God, and only when we know Christ can we be those who live in the revelation of God.
[45]  May the Lord grant us the grace to not only have some mental understanding of Christ but to have the inward revelation and seeing that will cause us to know Christ.
[46]  Such a knowledge of Christ will affect us inwardly so that our living and daily walk will be directed by the Lord.
[47]  Although this is good, this kind of goodness is religious and natural, because even without knowing Christ, without touching Christ, and without Christ being his Lord and directing him inwardly, he is willing and able to do such a thing.
[48]  Not only is Christ embodied in the Word, but He is also realized as the Spirit.
[49]  He Himself told us that the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of reality, would abide with us and be in us John 14:17 .
[50]  If we merely receive His leading and comfort without seeing or knowing Christ, something is still missing in the leading and comfort we are receiving, because the Holy Spirit in us is Christ.
[51]  With many of us, either we do not love and desire the Lord, or once we do, we have our own views and ideas.
[52]  The strange thing is that when we are indifferent toward the Lord, we simply put the Bible aside and do not read it.
[53]  However, after we are revived and become zealous, we begin to read the Bible, and in so doing we read everything that is in our mind into the Bible.
[54]  PUTTING ASIDE OUR OPINIONS IN ORDER TO KNOW CHRIST
[55]  If we read John 11, we can see two things.
[56]  CHAPTER SIX THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST THE REVELATION OF CHRIST
[57]  Galatians 1:11-12 says, "For I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel announced by me, that it is not according to man.
[58]  For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation by Jesus Christ."
[59]  The ancient saints and the past sages throughout history have no answer to the questions: What is the purpose of God in creating the heavens and the earth?
[60]  The Chinese sages and the Jewish prophets did not know this mystery.
[61]  Even Paul, who had been taught by a great rabbi, originally did not know it.
[62]  Yet one day God opened the veil to Paul, and he immediately saw something he saw Christ.
[63]  There was such a thing as the purpose of God for which God created the universe and mankind, but this purpose was hidden and not seen until the New Testament age when Christ came and was manifested for men to see.
[64]  It is not a matter of whether or not we worship God but a matter of whether or not we have Christ.
[65]  If we are not in Christ, even though we may say that we are serving God, in actuality we cannot serve God because God is not in our service.
[66]  All worship and service that is apart from Christ, though seemingly worship and service to God, is of religion.
[67]  ALL THE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD DWELLING IN CHRIST BODILY
[68]  Paul told the Galatians, "You observe days and months and seasons and years; I fear for you, lest I have labored upon you in vain" Gal 4:10-11 .
[69]  He said, "I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you" v. 19 . It is not a matter of whether we keep the law, practice circumcision, or observe the feasts; rather, it is a matter of Christ.
[70]  One day after hearing a message, or while praying, reading the Bible, or even walking on the street, the Holy Spirit may mysteriously and inwardly show us that our Savior Christ was hanged on the cross to die for us and that He bore our sins in His body, resurrected from the dead, and released His life to us so that if we would receive such a Christ, our sins would be forgiven and we would receive His life within.
[71]  The same principle that we saw above applies to all of our Christian experiences.
[72]  Not only our experience of salvation may have these two aspects, but after we are saved, our service before God may also have these two aspects.
[73]  We have to see at least once that Christ was crucified on the cross to bear our sins and that He is truly our Savior.
[74]  At this time we will see that once we go out, He comes in. From that day onward, we simply will not be able to make any resolutions or to have any hope in ourselves, because we will realize that it is no longer we who live, but Christ who lives in us.
[75]  CHAPTER EIGHT SERVICE ACCORDING TO RELIGION OR SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION SERVING IN THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[76]  In Philippians 3:3, Paul said, "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh."
[77]  According to the Greek, serve by the Spirit of God may also be translated as serve in the Spirit of God.
[78]  Without the concept of religion we have no way to come to God and to know God.
[79]  If we hold on to our religious concepts, however, we have no way to know God in a further way.
[80]  Hence, please remember that immediately after we receive the Lord and once we possess God, we must drop our religious concepts.
[81]  If we have religious service, we do not have Christ because religious service replaces Christ.
[82]  We already know what is meant by service according to religion, but do we understand what service according to revelation is?
[83]  Any service that we do without touching Christ or contacting Christ is not service according to revelation; rather, it is religious service.
[84]  We all know that Christians take the Bible as the basis of their living and work.
[85]  If we take Christ away from the Bible, there will be nothing left but skin and feathers without any content, because the Bible is a portrait of Christ.
[86]  Since the Bible is focused on Christ, if we see only patience but do not see Christ in our reading of the Bible, there is a problem with our reading.
[87]  I am afraid that many people are not clear about the difference between the church and the various Christian organizations.
[88]  The actual situation of the church, however, is not this way.
[89]  While on the path of our Christian life we have received the Lord's mercy to see the ground of the church.
[90]  Today if we desire something other than God, we will not be able to find the way of the church, and we will immediately lose the ground of the church.
[91]  NEEDING THE AUTHORITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN ADDITION TO THE PROPER GROUND
[92]  Nevertheless, we should not think that once we have the proper ground everything is all right.
[93]  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS CONCERNING THE CHURCH The Church Being a Great Test
[94]  Someone once asked what we should do if two churches with similar conditions but different grounds were established in the same locality on the same day by two different persons?
[95]  Someone else once asked, "If the Holy Spirit does not have the authority in the church, will God raise up another church?"
