   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some brothers say, "I have been busily working for more than one year, running here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have been so busy that my whole being is drained.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I am hungry, and I hope to go some place for a spiritual retreat."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when we read John 4, we realize that there is something wrong with these words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus Christ was wearied from His journey and sat by the well of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The disciples had gone into town to buy some food, which shows that the Lord was hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the well He met a woman of Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's will was for the Lord to speak to her and save her, and the Lord did it accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the disciples came back with the food they had bought, they invited the Lord to eat, but the Lord said, "I have food to eat that you do not know about" v. 32 . The disciples thought that someone else had given Him something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, in the following verses the Lord said to the disciples, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work" v. 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From this we see that working should only make us full; working should not make us hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spiritual work should make us full every time we engage in it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we become hungry every time we work, there must be something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we feel weak or deflated after we have worked, or if we feel that we are collapsing, it shows that there must be something wrong with our work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If our work is not separated from God's will, and if our work is not according to ourselves, every time we work, we will not collapse, but we will increase in strength.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times there is not an adequate preparation before the Lord, and we begin to work because there is a great need from outside or because of others' urging.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we work under such circumstances, something within us will collapse, and we will not have the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we finish such a work, there is no strength left within us, because something has gone wrong between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more we participate in any work outside of God's will, the more hungry we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for us to be satisfied, we must follow God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must realize that Christ is our bread; our bread is not spiritual retreats or scriptural doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not work until we become empty, and then go away for a rest; this is not our bread.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is our bread.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not preach until we run out of teachings to speak about, and then go and find some new doctrines; this is not our bread.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our bread is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether or not we are busy, if we have a word and the strength within, every time we stand up to speak for Christ, not only will the listeners be filled, but we will be filled as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the result of the Lord working in us and in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why we touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, after we are done, we will not feel any emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, we will feel that we have eaten a big meal and are full.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is wrong if we think that satisfaction depends on resting, on listening to messages, or on spiritual retreats.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Food comes when we allow the Lord to do what He wants to do in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us touch His life, and we will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In spiritual matters, one is not fed when he is at ease; he is fed when he is busy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While we are busy, we are fed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In spiritual matters, when we walk in the Lord's will, the busier we are, the more we will eat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We will not collapse through our busy schedules, and we will not become empty through these activities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe many brothers and sisters can testify of this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose you talk to a person today, yet God has not moved in that direction; He has not spoken in you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even though you may speak enthusiastically, after five or ten minutes of this kind of speaking, you will feel that something is wrong within.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may try to change the direction of your conversation because you feel that you cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Finally, when you leave, you will feel empty inside.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is nothing wrong with your words; the words are right, the attitude is also right, and you have tried your best to help.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the strange thing is that the more you speak, the emptier you become, and the more you feel that something has collapsed inside.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you leave, you will feel as though you have committed a big sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes you may see some outward results and may feel that you have done a good work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But when these feelings pass away, you feel just as empty and hungry within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever you do something by yourself, no matter how successful you are outwardly, inwardly you will feel deflated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers and sisters, have you ever had this kind of deflated feeling?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If your work is not done before the Lord, and if you are not following the Lord fearfully but are walking by yourself, even if you have the best motive or intention, you will still feel deflated and depleted of any spiritual vigor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You will feel as though the more you work, the more meaningless things become, and the more emptiness there is.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Under such circumstances, the more others speak of your success, the worse you will feel inside.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more others praise you and mention the help they have received from you, the more you will hate yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This shows that your work is not a kind of bread, because it does not satisfy you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, those who know the bread are the ones who have found satisfaction in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only Christ is the bread of life; only Christ can satisfy you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You will feel hungry with any work you have done if the work does not bring you in touch with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you touch the Lord, if you touch life, and if you touch spiritual reality, whether or not you are busy, you will be able to say, "Thank and praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord is my bread."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brothers and sisters, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is absolutely not something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The question is not where you have gone, what you have done, what message you have spoken, or how long you have spent in spiritual devotions.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The question is whether or not you have touched the Lord within.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whoever touches the Lord is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some brothers and sisters may say, "What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord has not called me to preach in any place or to work in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who give messages and work have the opportunity to be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But we are not professional preachers and workers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Are we going to go hungry?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Brothers and sisters, thank God we do not have to be hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We may be doing only the smallest things; we may speak only ten or twenty sentences to others, or may speak only ten or twenty minutes to others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But as long as it is something out of the Lord, and as long as we do these things according to the Lord's operation in us, we will feel relieved and satisfied after we have done them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is the Lord who gives us a burden, and once we unload the burden, we feel satisfied and full within.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once we touch God, we are satisfied and fed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, brothers and sisters, the workers do not have the exclusive right to eat; everyone has the chance to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Every day we have the opportunity to eat, and every day we also have the opportunity to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Christ is our bread.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we touch Him, we have bread.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Let me mention a deeper example.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We often think that something is good or spiritual, but this thing is not the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we carry it out, we feel empty inside.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We can only be satisfied when we follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Once a brother saw another brother walking in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>More than once he felt the need to clearly point out to the brother that the way he was taking was not a way of building up, but a way of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, he wanted to be a gentle Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He thought the best way was for him to smile and speak a few sweet-sounding words to persuade the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But every time he spoke in such a way, he felt like a glass with a hole in the bottom everything had leaked out.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In man's eyes, he did quite well; he was gentle, and he did not try to hurt anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In man's eyes, he was successful.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Yet he felt hungry and unsatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>After two or three months, he felt wrong and came to the Lord and prayed for light.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He asked the Lord to point out where he had gone wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>One day he said to the Lord, "Lord, I will do whatever You want me to do."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord listened to his prayer and showed him what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Later the other brother came again, and this one rebuked him severely.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>According to his nature, whenever he said a severe word to others, he would suffer for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But the strange thing was that this time, the more severely he spoke, the more he felt he was touching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He also did not have to make a confession, which he always did after he rebuked others.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Instead, he could praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After he rebuked the other brother, he felt as though he had taken a good meal.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This does not mean that we can rebuke others as much as we please.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is wrong to rebuke someone according to our will.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>However, it means that when we do anything according to the Lord's will, we are filled within, and we become stronger than ever.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This shows us a fact: the good that we can perform by ourselves is not our food.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We may think that as long as we can be gentle, everything will be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But experience tells us that even if we act gently, it is only our outward man who is doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It is a performance by our outward man, and this cannot become our food.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Only when the Lord moves in us and we move according to His will, can we receive food.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Whenever we touch life, we have food, and whenever we touch the Lord, we have satisfaction.</S>
