   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You have gathered us together around You as the all-inclusive compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, give us the revelation and give us the utterance, the new utterance, the up-to-date utterance, to speak forth You, the wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Give us a heart inclining to You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, we love You.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We love You particularly as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Pour out the Spirit upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lead us and anoint each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have covered one Bible, one God, and one Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we want to see one Spirit one application.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE SPIRIT BEING THE THIRD OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first point concerning the Spirit is that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Third of the Divine Trinity Gen 1:2; Rom 8:9; 1 Cor 2:11; Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is self-existing, ever-existing, and coinhering with the Father and the Son in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is, with the Father and the Son, the only God Acts 5:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Acts 5 tells us He is God, but He is not another God other than the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is of the Triune God, with the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SPIRIT BEING NOT YET BEFORE THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was the Spirit of God from eternity and the Holy Spirit at the time of Christ's incarnation Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20 , but He was not "the Spirit" before the resurrection of Christ John 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Christ's resurrection He was compounded with Christ's divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the life-giving Spirit, the divine anointing ointment as the compound Spirit Exo 30:22-31; 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All genuine Christians admit that in Christ there is humanity, because He became a man and partook of the flesh and blood of man Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But some may wonder how we can say that the Spirit of God has humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Chapter five of Andrew Murray's masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, is entitled "The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The glorified Jesus is Jesus after His resurrection in His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this chapter Andrew Murray strongly pointed out and insisted that today the Spirit of the glorified Jesus has the element of humanity just as the glorified Jesus does.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The glorified Jesus has divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Surely the Spirit of this Jesus has the same elements as the glorified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The striking point of Andrew Murray's theology is that the Spirit of Jesus has humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Based upon this revelation, I began to understand the type of the anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Exodus this ointment was used to anoint all the furniture and people related to God's service.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some of the Brethren pointed out that the anointing ointment was a type of the Spirit, but no one pointed out that this is the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>An ointment is a compound.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The ointment in Exodus 30 is compounded with olive oil as the base and four kinds of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Olive oil in the Old Testament is a type of God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Exodus 30 the olive oil, typifying God's Spirit, was compounded with four more elements.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These elements typify Christ's death with its effectiveness and His resurrection with its power which are in the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam, who was Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some who oppose this truth have said that this life-giving Spirit does not refer to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But besides the Holy Spirit, there is not another Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit who gives life 2 Cor 3:6 , the life-giving Spirit, is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>GOD'S ESSENCE AND GOD'S REACHING OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit is also God's essence John 4:24 and God's reaching of man Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the element of the Triune God, and the Spirit is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is God's reaching of man because He is the last one of the three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>John 4:24 says that if we are going to worship God, we must worship Him as the Spirit by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE REALIZATION OF THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST AND THE REALITY OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit is the realization of the pneumatic Christ John 14:16-20 and the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The pneumatic Christ is the Christ who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Resurrection is a Person the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>WHAT THE SPIRIT BECAME</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the Spirit became the consummated Spirit of the processed and consummated Triune God, even the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He also became the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord is Christ and the Spirit is the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, the pneumatic Christ is the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is now the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , and the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit of Jesus refers to Jesus in incarnation and human living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Spirit of Christ refers to Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
