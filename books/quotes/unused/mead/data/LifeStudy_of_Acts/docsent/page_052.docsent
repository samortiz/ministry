   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APOSTLES TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 29 through 31 Peter and the apostles answered and said, It is necessary to obey God rather than men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you slew, hanging Him on a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This One God has exalted to His right hand as a Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jesus incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man s Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader that He might be the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Concerning the Leader and the Savior</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek word rendered Leader is archegos, meaning author, origin, originator, chief leader, captain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 3:15 the same Greek word is translated Author.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God exalted the Man Jesus, rejected and killed by the Jewish leaders, as the highest Leader, the Prince, the Ruler of the kings to rule over the world Rev 1:5; 19:16 , and the Savior to save God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Leader is related to His authority, and Savior to His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority so that the environment may be fit for God s chosen people to receive His salvation Acts 17:26-27; John 17:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who rules the earth today?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may say that the earth is ruled by kings and presidents, but the Lord Jesus as the highest Ruler is above them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Revelation 1:5, He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Which title do you think is higher ruler or king?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Probably most people would say that a king is a higher title than a ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, the New Testament speaks of Christ as the Ruler of the kings, and Peter says that He is the Leader, the chief Ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a very real sense, Christ as the Ruler of the kings dethrones all the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only He is the Ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, according to Revelation 19:16, He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is both the Ruler and the King.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the Ruler, He rules the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It may seem that kings and presidents rule the earth and that the Lord Jesus is not on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, this One who seems not to be on the throne is the Ruler of all the enthroned ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today the entire world is under the Lord s ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is truly the Leader, the chief Ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For what purpose is the Lord Jesus ruling the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the Leader, the Ruler, He is ruling the earth for the purpose of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is ruling so that we may be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us take as an illustration the case of Chinese immigrants to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have found that a great many of these immigrants are very open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if they had remained in China, it is not likely that they would be this open.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus exercises His authority to cause so many foreigners to come to this country.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then once they arrive, they become open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is an illustration of the Lord s ruling the earth for the sake of saving people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We believe that God has chosen us, and then at the right time the Lord Jesus, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, exercised His authority to produce a certain environment so that we had no choice except to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In a sense, we have been caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A number of saints have testified that they have been caught by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may not feel this way when we are in a season of refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, when the sky above us is not clear and we are in a cloudy situation spiritually speaking, we may begin to consider that the Lord has caught us, even trapped us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may also believe that we are caught in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no way for us to escape from the Lord s trap.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have been caught by Christ and in Christ; furthermore, we have been caught in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a sense, this is our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have been caught by the Lord in His sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before we were saved, we were like mice running loose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Lord Jesus exercised His sovereign authority to set up a trap to catch us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The faster we ran, the easier it was for Him to catch us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this matter He is sovereign; He is the Ruler of the kings, arranging the environment so that we were constrained to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without such an environment, we would not have believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Actually, believing in the Lord does not depend on us it depends altogether on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He has been exalted to be the Leader over all the kings to arrange the environment so that His chosen people will believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 5:31 Peter says that God has exalted Christ to His right hand as a Leader and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After the Lord catches us, He becomes our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, He does not save us from being caught; rather, He keeps us in a trap in order to save us from God s condemnation, from the lake of fire, and from many evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His being the Leader is for authority, and His being the Savior is for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not know of anyone who has chosen to believe in Jesus on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We were all compelled to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many have testified, saying, Concerning believing in the Lord Jesus, I did not have any choice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I simply had to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Actually, none of us was willing to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all were caught by Him and constrained to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Praise the Lord that we believe in Him!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have pointed out that we cannot run away from the Lord s trap.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may use as an illustration the ark made by Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This ark is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once we have entered into Christ as our ark, we cannot get out.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need this ark, for without it we would perish.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In one of the messages on the book of Genesis, I said that the local church is an ark for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now we all are in this ark.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Who put you into the ark of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Did you put yourself there?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord is the One who has put us into the church ark.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He has been exalted by God to be the Leader, and as the Leader He has put us into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At times we may want to get out of the ark of the church, but we cannot escape.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because of the Lord Jesus as the Leader, we are in the ark, and now we should live together in it.</S>
