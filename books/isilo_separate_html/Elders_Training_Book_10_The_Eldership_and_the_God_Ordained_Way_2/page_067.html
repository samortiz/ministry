Because of this, in all the years a certain regard has been rendered to me by the dear saints. But compared with the regard that the ancient saints rendered to the Apostle Paul because of his excellent ministry, the regard that I have received from the saints is much less. Paul was never accused of being overly regarded throughout the past centuries. No one ever said that he was "exalted and honored above what is written, according to 1 Corinthians 4:6."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>10. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>Brother Lee and His Ministry Having Been Made<br>a Great Issue and Factor of Division</H2><P>"...A spiritual leader should never be made an issue or a factor of division, but Brother Lee and his ministry have been made a great issue and factor of division among us."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Practical Truth</H2><P>The first clause of John's word here indicates that he admits that there are spiritual leaders, but the second clause makes an accusation regarding a matter that does not exist. There has never been a "division among us" that was made with me and my ministry as "a great issue and factor." The intention of John, and of those who are for him, in trying to put my ministry aside is the real issue and factor of the division among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>11. The Dissenting Accusation&#151;<br>the Relationship with the Saints and<br>with the Church Being Made to Depend on<br>the Relationship to Brother Lee</H2><P>"In Matthew 22 the Lord...asked...the question..., 'What do you think of Christ?...' Everyone has to answer that question...But I'm afraid, that question has been changed among us to read this way&#151;'What do you think of Witness Lee? What is your relationship to him?'...Such a question should never become an issue or factor among us, so that our going on or our relationship with the saints and with the church is made to depend on our relationship to him. But this has been the case."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> </body></html>
