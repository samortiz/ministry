As God's servant, Paul was a steward of God, and God gave him a ministry, a service, which is called the stewardship
In 1 Timothy 1:3-4, Paul tells Timothy to charge certain ones not to teach differently but to teach the dispensation, the economy, of God
Many appreciate the first part of John 3:16 which says that 'God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son'
The deepest layer of God's salvation is God's plan to work Himself into His created, chosen, redeemed, and regenerated people
God not only desires that man be His vessel to contain Him , but also wants man to eat, digest, and assimilate Him
In the same way, God's eternal plan is to dispense Himself into us so that He becomes every fiber of our inward being
If man ate of the tree of life, he would live; but if he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would die
The blood of the Passover lamb was sprinkled on the side posts and the upper doorpost of the houses of the Israelites
Under the covering of the blood of the Passover lamb, they were to eat the flesh of the Passover lamb, not leaving anything for the next day
If there was more lamb than one household could eat, the Israelites were to share the lamb with their neighbor next door
We should lead our neighboring families to share in God's rich and boundless salvation, which our family cannot exhaust
After the Israelites were filled with the lamb through eating, they were strengthened in order to make their exodus out of Egypt
The Israelites marched out of Egypt, and while they were marching, they were digesting and assimilating the lamb
The divine economy is the mystery of God's will, a mystery which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things
The divine economy is according to God's eternal purpose which He made in Christ to head up all things in Christ
Any division, regardless of the reason, must be condemned because division is against God's heading up of all things in Christ
God desires to have a church to be the Body of Christ as His fullness for a corporate expression of the processed Triune God
To dispense Himself into us He has taken three steps the Fathers choosing and predestinating the Sons redeeming and the Spirits sealing
We were put in Christ so that we could be made an inheritance of God with Christ as the element and realm of the divine inheritance
Eventually, the entire paper will be sealed, saturated, and permeated with the substance of the ink in the image of the seal
The Spirits sealing saturates the sealed ones through the dispensing of the sealing ink unto or for the day of the redemption of their body
Until the transfiguration of our body, the sealing of the Spirit will go on continually to saturate and permeate our entire being
The church as the issue of the divine dispensing is through the transmission, the dispensing, of the resurrected and ascended Christ
God's power was wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies
According to chapter one of Ephesians, the church has been constituted for its existence through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity
The dispensing of the Divine Trinity is of the Father as the source , of the Son as the course , and of the Spirit as the flow
The ink stamped onto a piece of paper will eventually become dry, but the Spirit as the sealing ink remains 'wet' all the time unto eternity
The stewardship of the apostle is to dispense, to minister, the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel to the nations
In the next chapter, the Holy Spirit inspired the writer of Acts to say, 'Peter, standing together with the eleven'
In Revelation 2 the church in Ephesus was commended by the Lord because they discerned the genuine apostles from the false apostles
A little sister who is willing to be sent by the Lord to preach the gospel to her parents is an apostle, a sent one
Each day, if we would answer the Lord's call by saying, 'Here am I, send me,' we would be the Lord's sent ones, His apostles
The saints who have full-time jobs are a little different from Paul in that they must be occupied in making a living
In addition to this there are various other affairs they have to take care of in regard to their families otherwise they could not survive
The policeman who directs traffic seems to be just a small man with a uniform standing in the middle of the street
In your going, God operates by distributing to you the sufficient grace as your capital to carry out the preaching of the gospel
When we go out to visit people with the gospel, we go out to minister Christ with His unsearchable riches to sinners
In Haggai the Lord charged the children of Israel to go up to the mountain to bring wood in order to build His house
We have other rooms in our being, but they are secret rooms because we have not allowed the Lord to enter these rooms
In the way we live, in the way we dress ourselves, and in the way we drive our car, there may be no ground for Christ
Christ was in the center of the saints being in their spirit but He had not yet come into the parts of their soul surrounding their spirit
Christ was limited and imprisoned within their spirit; He could not spread into the inner parts of their being
For Christ to make His home in our hearts means that He is able to spread Himself into our mind, emotion, will, and conscience
Christ makes His home in the hearts of the saints through the Spirit's operating within the saints with the dispensing of the divine power
They may know that the Spirit is within them, but they do not realize that this Spirit is not only their life but also their power
The Father strengthens us according to the riches of what He is, the Spirit operates in power, and the Son makes His home in our hearts
With the Father's strengthening and the Spirit's empowering, the Son has the ground, the opportunity, to enlarge Himself in our inner being
No one can say how broad the breadth is, how long the length is, how high the height is, or how deep the depth is
He is also our drink, our food, our clothing, our wisdom, our knowledge, our sanctification, and our redemption
Through the Fathers holy nature and divine life with the Sons divine element we are constituted into a treasure which the Father can inherit
The oneness that God desires with man is illustrated by what takes place when we eat, digest, and assimilate food
God gave His Son to man to be The tree of life so rich and free, That every man may taste and see That God is good for food
In John 6:51 Jesus said, 'I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever'
In the ancient time, the Israelites had to collect the manna before the rising of the sun, because when the sun became hot, the manna melted
Many followed Him during the three and a half years of His ministry because He infused the embodied God into people
Many in Christianity hold the concept that the Lord was merely teaching His disciples during this time but this understanding is too shallow
After the three and a half years of His ministry, the Lord Jesus went to the cross and died in order to accomplish an all-inclusive death
Through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection with regeneration, the processed Triune God is now within us
On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came back to His disciples and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Immediately after eating, the fine work of dispensing begins in order to dispense the food into the cells, fibers, and tissues of our being
In the same way, the dispensing of the Triune God is to make the processed and consummated Triune God the very constitution of our being
Ephesians 4:4 says that there is one Body and one Spirit, and verse 5 says, 'One Lord, one faith, one baptism'
When you appreciate the Lord, worship Him, esteem Him, and go along with Him, immediately faith is with you, uniting you to the Lord
Through all' means that He knows our situation intimately because He has passed through all of the things regarding us
If you are a manager of a company, you must go through all of the offices and rooms of your company in order to know what is going on
All of the foregoing items, such as watering, feeding, strengthening, permeating, saturating, and anointing, are matters of dispensing
We must learn to be satisfied with ordinary days which are filled with regular and normal practices in the divine dispensing
Through this divine dispensing, gifts have been constituted by Christ as the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Head
The particular gifts He gave to the church were some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers
All the saints will be perfected to do the work of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
In Christianity the perfecting by the gifts, which corresponds to the teaching of the professors in a college, is not that widespread
The new way is a way in which all the gifted persons perfect the other members of the Body of Christ to do what they do
Ephesians 4:15 says, 'But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ'
Because all the riches of the Head have been dispensed into us, we grow with these riches in all things into the Head
The work of the divine dispensing will not be finalized until our body is saturated and permeated by the sealing Spirit to be glorified
God gave His Son to us not only that we may be saved through the Son, but even the more that He could dispense Himself into us
The resurrection of the crucified Son imparted the divine life into the regenerated believers for the divine dispensing
Christ's death released His divine life from within His human shell, and the resurrection imparted and applied the divine life to us
In the incarnation God became a man, but in His resurrection, Christ as the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit
On the cross He was our Redeemer, in the heavens He is our Savior, and within us He is the life-giving Spirit to be our life
After Jesus was resurrected, He simply came back to His disciples and breathed Himself into them as the holy breath
The resurrected Christ is eaten by the believers and indwells them, dispensing the divine elements into them for their satisfaction
In this way, the processed Triune God is dispensed into the believers as life and the life supply in abundance
The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers
John 7:38-39a says, 'He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water
John 15 does not merely speak of the preaching of the gospel to save sinners, because John is a Gospel of life
Many of the dear saints love the Lord and the Lord's recovery very much and are seeking to practice the new way for the church life
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
We can command them to pray, and after they pray, we can command them to be baptized into the name of the Triune God
Matthew 28:19 first says that we should disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
After a new believer is baptized we should sit down with him to feed him and come back as soon as possible to have a meeting in his own home
If possible, on the day after their baptism, we should return to feed the new ones with reading and pray-reading the Bible
We should instead go to the new believers and live a proper Christian life in front of them in a very simple way
The issue of breathing, drinking, and eating Jesus is the flow of the living water, fruit-bearing, and the feeding of the lambs
We have to live a daily life of breathing, drinking, and feeding on Christ, taking Christ every day as our very element and essence
We must not only receive Him, but also digest Him, assimilate Him, and let Him become the content of our being
