BEING MAINLY FOR BUILDING UP</h2>
<p>In the administration of the church, there is one matter that has been neglected by all the churches. In our understanding, the administration of the church is related to the administration of business affairs. Some may even understand that administration means to administrate, to manage people. Even though this is not wrong, it is not the real meaning of the administration of the church. The administration of the church is mainly for the building up of the believers corporately, not individually. The administration of the church is mainly to build many individuals up together. Where there is no administration, there is no building, but if there is administration, there is also a need to build people up together.</p>
<p>How should the administration be carried out in order for there to be the building up? The twelve elders in the church in Taipei may arrange to have twenty-eight brothers responsible for the group meetings. To a certain extent such an arrangement is focused on building, especially if there are brothers and sisters who love the Lord and pursue spirituality but have no practical coordination among themselves. In order to have practical coordination, there is a need for the administration of the church. But the elders should not stop at appointing responsible brothers who could bear responsibility for the home meeting. This administration clearly has the nature of building. However, they should advance.</p>
<p>The elders may observe that a brother who should be responsible for a group meeting has problems that need to be taken care of; otherwise, he will be unable to bear responsibility with others in the future. The elders should spend time considering this brother, praying for him and fellowshipping with him. They should continue in prayer and fellowship until they are able to speak with this brother concerning the problems. If this brother receives the fellowship, the problems will be removed, and there will be no problems when he coordinates with others for the group meeting. This is building.</p>
<p>This can be compared to building with stones. In order for one stone to be upon another, the bottom stone must be flat. Any part of the stone that protrudes needs to be ground away in order for another stone to be secure when it is placed on top of it. This shows that building involves more than placing one stone upon another. It also involves removing the protruding parts of a stone so that it can be built upon another. This is the meaning of administration. When those who administrate the church see that a brother who could bear responsibility is lacking something, they should make up the lack for him. This can also be compared to looking for stones to build a house. A suitable stone may have a protruding edge that needs to be ground away. Then the stone can be built upon others securely.</p>
<p>It may also be that a responsible brother may not speak much and may not be apt to minister the word, but his administration in the meeting can still have the flavor of building. He observes the brothers and sisters and knows when they are ready to bear responsibility or when they need some training. Eventually the saints in his meeting will be able to bear some responsibility. This is building, and this is administration. Therefore, the elders should spend one-fourth of their meeting time to discuss business affairs and three-fourths of the time to discuss the condition of the brothers and sisters. They should not gossip about the strengths and shortcomings of the saints. Rather, they should study the saints to know if they are fulfilling their duties or have problems. There may be a brother who seems to be very useful, but he has a problem. Likewise, another brother may be able to minister the word, but he is not mature enough to be a deacon. Consequently, the elders should consider the best way to help these brothers. An elder may be burdened to spend six months with them so that they may be perfected and continue to function in the ministry of the word. This type of administration of the church has value and weight. Administration does not merely deal with business affairs. It is to build the believers up.</p>
<p>Regrettably, our administration of the church is still lacking. When a saint has a problem, the elders should study the situation and take care of it according to the building. If the problem is not properly taken care of, other saints will also have problems, and the building will be frustrated.</p>
<p>When I bore responsibility in a local church in northern China, we did much in the aspect of administrating the church. Material offerings were also included in the administration of the church. We did not give our offerings indiscriminately. The giving was done under the leading of the administration of the church, ensuring that the recipient would truly benefit from the offering. The way we render help to a needy brother is part of the administration. This is what elders should do. Elders are shepherds, teachers, and administrators. These three functions are interrelated and should not be separated. Some brothers are good at handling business affairs, and some are good at perfecting the saints. However, the elders should not work separately; they should coordinate together as one person to observe all the sides of a situation. When the majority of the time and energy in the elders&rsquo; meeting, which is for the administration of the church, is spent on business affairs, the church suffers a loss, because the spiritual needs of the saints are not touched. When the administration of the church does not touch the spirit of the saints, the church suffers a loss.</p>
<p>Three-fourths of the time and energy in the elders&rsquo; meeting should be spent on the spiritual situation of the saints. We cannot do without the business aspect of the administration of the church, but we need more practice on how much to use our time on it. Administrating the spiritual needs of the saints requires much more effort and time than the mere management of business affairs. It requires our patience, wisdom, and strong will to do everything in love, not according to natural affection. This can be compared to the situation of a doctor and a patient. A doctor prescribes what his patient needs in love. When the patient needs medication, he prescribes it; if the patient needs an operation, he performs it. Therefore, in the administration of the church, the elders should learn when to be soft, hard, quick, and slow. They should be balanced in every situation. They should not handle every situation the same way. One situation may require severity, and another may require leniency. All of these matters require learning.</p>
<p>Leading people to salvation does not require much learning. Likewise, edifying people does not require much learning. However, if we desire to administrate the church and to minister the word to build up the children of God for the manifestation of God&rsquo;s dwelling place and the functioning of the Body of Christ, we need to learn many lessons. If we do not learn the lessons, we may save sinners and perfect the saints but be unable to build them up to be the Body of Christ, the dwelling place of God. It is even possible that we ourselves will not be built up. If this is the case, we can serve as elders or in the ministry of the word, but our administration of the church and our ministering of the word can only cause the saints to love the Lord zealously and be individually spiritual. It cannot build them up together to be filled with the presence of God inwardly and the authority of God outwardly so that they become the dwelling place of God, the Body of Christ, God&rsquo;s desire. If we endeavor to properly carry out the administration of the church, the power and effect of our gospel will increase, and the effect of our edification of the saints will also increase.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
