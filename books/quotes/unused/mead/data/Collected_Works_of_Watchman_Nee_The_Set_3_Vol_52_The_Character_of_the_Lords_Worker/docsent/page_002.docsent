   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PREFACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Volume 52 of The Collected Works contains ten messages by Watchman Nee on the subject of the character of the Lord's worker.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The messages have been previously translated into English and published as The Normal Christian Worker.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These messages, however, have been newly translated and entitled The Character of the Lord's Worker, conforming to the original Chinese title.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The book covers ten character traits that are crucial to the usefulness of a Christian worker in the Master's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The messages were given by Watchman Nee in 1948 during a training for the edification of his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The intimate and uninhibited nature of the messages derives from the willingness of the trainees to give Watchman Nee the freedom to speak and to rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As such, the subjects touch the very core of a worker's being.</S>
