   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX REPORT ON THE WORK 1 Co-workers' Meeting Date: May 1, 1948, Saturday, 7:00 p.m.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai PUTTING THE JERUSALEM PRINCIPLE INTO PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a little too early for the co-workers to take the way of Antioch today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The principle of Antioch that we practiced before begins from Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In practice we have omitted chapters one through twelve; we have skipped the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man thinks that the work of spreading the gospel from Jerusalem through Judea, Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth was done by the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But God's Word says that the apostles remained in Jerusalem Acts 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jerusalem was the place where Peter worked, and Samaria was the place where Philip worked.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When Philip reached Samaria, he gained the Samaritans.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord did say that the gospel is to be preached to the uttermost part of the earth, but He did not say that the same group of people would be doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who went to Samaria were one group, and those who go to the uttermost part of the earth are another group.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the apostles gained men in Jerusalem, they sent them out to Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From Samaria the gospel will pass through other hands until it reaches the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the past we put the principle of Antioch into practice too early.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now is not the time to practice the principle of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now is the time to practice the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although we cannot say that we are absolutely clear today, when the few responsible brothers came together, we felt that we should begin our work from the coastal regions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From now until August can be considered as one phase of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During this phase all the workers in the whole nation will consolidate in Foochow and Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Witness Lee will take up the responsibility in Shanghai, and Brother Chen Ke-san will take up the responsibility in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition, we need to have training meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After August the work will concentrate on three areas: Tientsin, Tsingtao, and Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We will leave Hong Kong, Swatow, and Peking alone for the time being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We will initially establish a firm footing in the first three places.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Tientsin is linked to Manchuria on the one hand, and to the Northwest on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Tsingtao will be particularly important to the Chiao-Chi railway line.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today the largest number of believers are in Fukien.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Next is Shantung.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From Tsingtao we can gain the whole province of Shantung.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We hope to commit the whole area to the brothers in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The responsibility of the brothers in Shanghai is toward the west, in cities like Hankow and Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The direction in Fukien is also toward the west.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the same time, Fukien should take care of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The work in the provinces of Kwangtung and Kwangsi should begin from Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the future, when Southeast Asia rises up, Hong Kong should also have a start.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Presently, we cannot see that far.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The gospel work is done in portions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The relay race is a very good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One man takes one portion, and the next man takes another portion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is like the students of Chiao-Tung University who ran from Nanking to Shanghai; every one of them ran a portion of the whole journey.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We admit that the principle of Antioch is still very necessary for the future, but the way we should take at present is the way of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The work is developed through the fruit gained in Jerusalem, not through the going out of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every believer should have his living centered on the gospel; his work, occupation, dwelling, and livelihood should all be for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church should continually send out more people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After we finish the building of the meeting hall, in a month or so, it will not be difficult to see the number double.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is even possible to triple or quadruple our number in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our failure during the past years has been due to the absence of the vision of the Jerusalem principle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From 1937 we have been practicing the principle of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But only today, in 1948, have we begun to go back to the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
