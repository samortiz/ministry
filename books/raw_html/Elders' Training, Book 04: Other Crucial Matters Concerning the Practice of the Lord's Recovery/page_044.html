<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER  NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>PRACTICAL POINTS FOR THE ELDERS</h1><h2 class=head1>REPROVING A SINNING ELDER</h2><p>In this chapter we will cover a number of crucial, practical points for the elders. First, we want to look at a charge which Paul gave to Timothy concerning his dealings with the elders in 1 Timothy 5:19-20: “Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses. Those who sin reprove before all that the rest also may be in fear.” In verse 20 there are three points—“those who sin” refers to elders, “all” refers to the whole church, and “the rest” refers to the other elders. Paul charged Timothy to reprove a sinning elder before the whole church. A sinning elder should receive public reproof because of his public position. The public reproof is so that the rest of the elders also may be in fear.<h2 class=head1>NOT RULING BUT MANAGING</h2><p>Thus far, we have seen from the Word that no rank is ascribed to the eldership and also, in a sense, no position. Of course, we have seen that even a small boy has a position in society, but in the sense of rank there is no position for the elders. Also, in a sense, no authority is ascribed to the elders based upon the Lord’s word in Matthew 20:20-28 and Matthew 23:8-12. The Lord told us that among the believers there should be no master, no ruler. Whoever wants to be great has to serve as a slave. Basically speaking, no slave has any authority. Peter also told us that he was an elder, yet he told his fellow-elders not to lord it over God’s possession, the flock, but to be an example.<p>In this sense we can see that the New Testament does not give authority for the elders to rule. When I mention the fact that no authority is given to the elders, I add the phrase “in a sense” because I have reserved something. The New Testament does not give the elders the authority in the sense of ruling, but there is still the sense of management. First Timothy indicates that the elders should manage God’s house, No manager of a business is given the authority to rule the employees, but the manager surely has to manage the employees. In the sense of managing, we may consider that authority is given to the managing one.<p>Also, Hebrews 13:17 refers to the elders who take the lead in the church life. The saints are to obey the ones leading them. Even in the sense of leading the saints, there is some authority. In this sense, we can see that in a local church there is God’s arrangement to keep a local church in a good order. In this sense, the elders have some authority, but we must be clear about this one thing—no authority has been given to the elders to rule over others. This is wrong. At the very most the elders are the managers of a house, not the ruler, the lord, or the master. We are told clearly in the New Testament that among the believers no one is a master and no one is a ruler. Peter also tells the elders not to lord it over the believers. The elders are not given any ruling authority.<h2 class=head1>THE TEACHING OF IGNATIUS AND ITS ISSUE</h2><p>Because of the wrong understanding of the New Testament, a system of bishops, the Episcopalian system, was established and this corrupted the entire church. Ignatius was negligent in his teaching of this matter. He understood that the word bishop, or overseer, refers to someone who is higher than an elder. The title of elders does not convey any denotation of ruling. An elder is a person of maturity. The word overseer, however, may be mistakenly understood to mean someone who is a controller. It was by this kind of overt understanding that Ignatius made a mistake which sowed the seed to produce the vast hierarchy in Christendom. Because of the history of Christianity which includes Catholicism with its great hierarchy of the pope, the cardinals, the archbishops, and the bishops, I have greatly stressed that no authority is given to the elders.<p>The papal system, in which the authority is ascribed to the pope, has ruined the church to the uttermost. In the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, there is actually no church and no Body of Christ, but just an organized, worldly system. In Catholicism the Body was killed and the church was annulled. Because of this, the Reformers reacted and many left the Catholic Church to form the Protestant churches. They came out of that worldly system, the Catholic Church, but they could not get away absolutely from the leaven which was brought in and that crept in secretly through Ignatius. Therefore, the beginning of the Protestant churches was the state churches. Among the state churches, the worst one in the matter of hierarchy is the Church of England which is very close to the Roman Catholic Church.
