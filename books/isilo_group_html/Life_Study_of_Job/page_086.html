On the Lord's Day John was in his spirit. We all need to learn to be imprisoned in our spirit and not to get out of our spirit. We must be persons who are in our spirit all the time. If we are this kind of person, others will not be able to understand us because in spirit we are moving as our God is moving in us.</P><P>When we turn to our spirit and get into our spirit, even while we are driving, we may sing, praise, or rejoice. We may also cry, weeping as we pray, "Lord, look at the situation of Your Body." We have all tasted this to some extent. We must be perfected and built up to be such persons. There is no other way to be a lover of God, to be a seeker of Christ, or to be an overcomer than to be in spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENJOYING CHRIST AND THE CHURCH IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>If you are a person in the spirit, then you will be in the spirit to meet God, to see God, and to stay with God. And this God is the consummated Spirit, the reality of Christ. Furthermore, when you have Christ, you have the church because Christ is the Head of the new man and the church is the Body. Then you will enjoy the church, the Body, as well as Christ, the Head.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PREVAILING PRAYERS OF A PERSON<br>IN THE SPIRIT MOVING IN THE LORD'S MOVE</H2><P>When you are in the spirit, the matters of the local church will come to you, and this will cause you to pray for the situation of the church. These prayers are the real, prevailing prayers because you pray in your spirit and because, in spirit, you are moving in the Lord's move. Your prayer is the Lord's move in you. You and the Lord, the Lord and you, are two moving together and praying together. This is quite sweet and is very different from the prayer that is out of responsibility, obligation, or some kind of duty. This is a prayer in sweet fellowship with the Lord.</P><P>The way to be such a person is very simple&#151;the way is to be in our spirit. I very much like the phrase "in spirit on the Lord's Day." First, John was in his spirit, and then he heard the voice, a "loud voice like a trumpet." When he turned to see the voice that spoke with him, he saw the vision of the seven golden lampstands (Rev. 1:12). We all need to learn of John to be in our spirit to see the vision and to enjoy the Lord, to enjoy the Body, and to enjoy the speaking of the Spirit to the churches.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_085.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_087.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Job &nbsp; pg 86</div><br></body></html>
