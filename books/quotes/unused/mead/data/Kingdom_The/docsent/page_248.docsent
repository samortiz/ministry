   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE HEAVENS AND THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we need to consider the differences between these kinds of kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First is the difference between the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a difference between the two, but they cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, we can differentiate our hand from our body, but we cannot separate them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The body is the whole, while the hand is part of the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The two can be differentiated, but cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, the kingdom of God is the whole, while the kingdom of the heavens is a part of the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They can be differentiated, but cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The kingdom of God is the reigning of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since it is God's reigning, it follows God's existence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's exis-tence is from eternity to eternity, without beginning or ending; therefore, God's reigning, God's kingdom, is also from eternity to eternity, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible shows us that the kingdom of God embraces a wide scope: it embraces eternity without beginning before the foundation of the world, Adam in the garden and the chosen patriarchs, the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, today's church, the millennium and the kingdom of the heavens in the future, and the new heaven and the new earth, which are eternal and without ending.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these six items are included in the kingdom of God and are parts of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>See chart on pages 338-339.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Daniel 7:13-14 shows that the kingdom which the Lord Jesus is bringing with Him at His second coming is the eternal kingdom which God will set up on the earth Dan 2:44 , and which is received from the Ancient of Days Luke 19:12, 15 , and belongs to the Ancient of Days, that is, to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This proves not only that the kingdom which the Lord Jesus will be establishing on earth is the kingdom of God, but also that the kingdom is from ancient times, from eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew 3:2, 4:17, and 10:7 indicate that when John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus, and the disciples went out to preach, the kingdom of the heavens had not yet come, but was near.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew 21:43 shows that before the kingdom of the heavens came, the kingdom of God was already in the midst of the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, because they brought forth no proper fruit, the kingdom of God was taken away from them and given to a people who would bring forth the fruits, that is, to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, the kingdom of God today is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This proves that both the nation of Israel in the Old Testament and the church in the New Testament are the kingdom of God, being parts of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now let us read Luke 13:28-29: "There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These verses prove that the millennium in the future is also a part of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is mentioned here concerning those who will sit down in the kingdom of God is related to the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although it is in the millennium, the Word says it is in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is because the millennium is a part of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 5:5 and Revelation 11:15 reveal that the kingdom of the heavens in the future is also a part of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These verses also mention the kingdom of Christ and of God and the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In both cases, the kingdom is singular in the original, showing that the kingdom of Christ and of God and the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ are not two kingdoms, but one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kingdom is the kingdom of the heavens in the future and also the eternal kingdom of Christ mentioned in 2 Peter 1:11.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kingdom of the heavens in the future is the ruling of Christ as King; hence, it is the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time, it is God's ruling; hence, it is also the kingdom of God.</S>
