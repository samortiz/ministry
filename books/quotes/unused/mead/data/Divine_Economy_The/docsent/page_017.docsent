   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>IN THE CONCEPTION AND MINISTRY OF</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>JESUS BY THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14, 16-18; 5:43a; 6:46; 7:29; 16:27b; 8:16, 29; 16:32; 14:9-11; 10:30; 6:57a; 5:30b, 36b; 10:37; 14:24b; 10:25b; 7:18; Luke 1:31-35; Matt 1:18-23; 3:16-17; 12:28; Luke 4:14, 18-19; Acts 10:38; Heb 9:14</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus far we have covered three main items the divine economy, the embodiment of God, and the flow of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The embodiment of God and the flow of God are both for the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For God to dispense Himself into His chosen people, He needs to be embodied, and He also needs to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this chapter we want to go on further to see how God is embodied in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jesus as the tree of life is God's embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because God is Spirit John 4:24a , He is mysterious and abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was no way for people to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in God's wisdom, He became embodied in a man by the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the history of mankind there was a man among men who was God's embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you touch that man, you touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you receive that man, you receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you have that man, you have God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is no longer abstract but embodied in the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is no more mysterious but manifested, no more invisible but now touchable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our God today is the embodied God, the manifested God, the touchable God, and this touchable God is a man by the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The main purpose of the Gospel of John is to show us the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It gives us a full record of how God has embodied Himself in this man, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John wrote his Gospel in a simple way, but all the points conveyed in it are marvelous, profound, and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Most of the verses in the Scripture reading are not studied by many Bible readers or teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians have known John 3:16 from their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But how many know John 6:46 and 5:30?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many verses in the Gospel of John are neglected and missed, but we have to come to these verses to see the very embodiment of God in this man, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ's incarnation was with the Father, and His human living was also with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His incarnation refers to His birth, and His human living refers to His life while He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jesus as the embodiment of God was born to live on this earth, and His birth and His life on this earth were both for God's dispensing in the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The divine dispensing is the main factor of Jesus' birth and life on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In His birth Jesus brought the Father with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many of us may have never realized that when Jesus came through the incarnation, He came with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The little babe born in the manger was with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, when Jesus was living on this earth, He was always with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was never alone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When He was traveling from village to village, from Judea to Samaria, from Samaria to Galilee, He was never alone because the Father was always with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was always traveling with the Father.</S>
