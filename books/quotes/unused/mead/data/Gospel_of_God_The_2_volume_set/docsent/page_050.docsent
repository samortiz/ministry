   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S SALVATION FOR THE DEMONSTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is one book in the Bible, the book of Romans, that tells us how God deals specifically with this one problem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us read Romans 3:25-26, beginning with the second part of verse 25: "For the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here I must add a word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some versions make a mistake in translating verse 25.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They translate: "To declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the word "for" should not be used in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead it should read: "For the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Further, in verse 26 the word "and" should be understood as linking two things that occur at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, this clause should be understood in this way: "that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>While God justifies those who believe in Jesus, He is shown to be righteous, and man is to acknowledge Him as being righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 25 deals with the problems in the past, and verse 26 deals with the problems in the present.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problems in the past relate to the people of the Old Testament times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The problems in the present relate to the people of the New Testament times.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 25 deals with an Old Testament issue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 26 deals with a New Testament issue.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those in the Old Testament times transgressed the law for four thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were full of sins and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But God did not send them into perdition or destruction immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During those four thousand years, day by day God forbore and passed over the sins previously committed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not see the lake of fire immediately after the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although God told man that in the day that he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil he would surely die Gen 2:17 , when Adam did eat of the fruit, he did not go immediately into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why not?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because God passed over the sins of the Old Testament times; He exercised His forbearance over them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God exercised forbearance and passed over the sins committed by man in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But a question arises immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Was God righteous in exercising forbearance and passing over man's sins in the Old Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What was God's purpose in doing this?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, in passing over man's sins and in exercising forbearance, God was declaring His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God does not want us to think that after we are saved our salvation is an illegal one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God would not have man harbor such criticisms.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wants to show us that there is nothing illegal or unrighteous in His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Concerning the sins of the Old Testament times, He says that His forbearance and His passing over were for the demonstrating of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Concerning the sins of the present time, He says that what is done is also for the demonstrating of His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He desires that in justifying those who believe in Jesus He would be known as the righteous One.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's salvation is not some "backdoor merchandise."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God wants our salvation to be one that comes from the "front door."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our salvation has to be right and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will not allow anyone to say that our salvation is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He does not offer a fraudulent salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A fraudulent salvation is rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's intention is to save us, but He will do so in a way that is related to His nature, His moral standard, His dignity, His law, and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God cannot save us lawlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If God were willing to use whatever means possible to save us and if He were to ignore the matter of righteousness altogether, He could say to anyone, "Go; you are free."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are men who are foolishly good.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If God were to say this, He would be a foolishly good God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God would never be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If God did not love you, it would be easy He would just let you die and perish when you sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But He cannot allow this to happen because He loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The problem is that the sin of man and the love of God are together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the righteousness of God is added to these two, salvation becomes the most difficult thing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If man had not sinned, everything would be fine; and if God had not loved, there would be no problem either.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If someone commits a crime and must die, it has nothing to do with me if I do not love him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today many are taken from prisons to be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The matter concerns me little if I do not love them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is difficult only if I love them and if I want to rescue them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If they have not sinned, the matter would be easy to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And if I do not love them, the matter is also easy to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Further, if they have sinned and I love them but have no righteousness, the matter can still be taken care of easily; I can handle the matter irresponsibly through bribery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if I am a righteous person, I cannot resort to such fraudulent and improper methods.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I would not let them go illegally.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If I am to rescue them, I have to rescue them righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To carry out such a salvation becomes the most difficult task on the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These three matters love, sin, and righteousness cannot easily coexist.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Love is a fact; sin is also a fact; and righteousness is a necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because these three are together, God must come up with a way to save us and to satisfy His heart of love, while at the same time preserving His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Accomplishing such a work would be a masterpiece indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The salvation which God has prepared for us in His Son Jesus is such a masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He is able to save us from our sins and demonstrate His love, and He is able to do so in a most righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This He does through the work of redemption by the Lord Jesus.</S>
