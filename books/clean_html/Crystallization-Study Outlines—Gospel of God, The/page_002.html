<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Christ as the Triune God-man (Col. 2:9) is the threefold seed in humanity: the seed of the woman (Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14; Gal. 4:4), the seed of Abraham (Gen. 12:7; Matt. 1:1; Gal. 3:16), and the seed of David (2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Matt. 1:1; 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3; Rev. 22:16):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In resurrection Christ, as the last Adam in the flesh, the threefold seed in humanity, became (was transfigured&mdash;pneumatized&mdash;into) the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, to dispense Himself into us (1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2) for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.</li>
	<li>As the seed of the woman, He destroyed God&rsquo;s enemies; as the seed of Abraham, He became the consummated Triune God as our full blessing, the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit; and as the seed of David, He causes us to reign in life, share in His kingship, and become His kingdom that fills the whole earth, making the whole earth God&rsquo;s kingdom (Dan. 2:34-35).</li>
	<li>Thus, the enemies are gone, the blessing is here, and we are in the kingdom&mdash;this is the good news of the revelation of the entire Bible!</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the seed of the woman refers to the incarnated Christ, the complete God who became a perfect man through the dispensing of Himself into humanity and the One who destroyed Satan to save the believers in Christ from sin and death&mdash;Gen. 3:15; Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:16, 20-21, 23; Gal. 4:4; John 1:1, 14; 8:24, 28, 58; Heb. 2:14; 1 Cor. 15:53-57:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;God sent forth His Son, born of a woman,&rdquo; for our judicial redemption; God &ldquo;sent forth the Spirit of His Son,&rdquo; the transfiguration of His Son, to &ldquo;sonize&rdquo; us for our organic salvation&mdash;Gal. 4:4-6; 3:13-14.</li>
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of the woman, dispensed into us to bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head in us and make us the corporate seed of the woman, the overcoming man-child, to carry out God&rsquo;s judgment on the ancient serpent and to be God&rsquo;s dispensational instrument to change the age and usher in the manifestation of God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;Rev. 12:5.</li>
	<li>The Lord as the leading Overcomer (3:21) is the Head, center, reality, life, and nature of the man-child, and the man-child as the following overcomers is the Lord&rsquo;s Body:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The way to become the man-child is for us to be daily strengthened into our inner man, to be empowered to experience the riches of Christ, and to be strong through putting on the all-inclusive Christ as the armor, taking the word by means of all prayer&mdash;Eph. 3:16; 6:10-20.</li>
		<li>The spontaneous life-power of Christ as the life-seed bruises the serpent&rsquo;s head in us as we employ the blood of the Lamb, speak forth the word of our testimony, and love not our soul-life even unto death&mdash;Rom. 8:2; Rev. 12:10-11; Acts 1:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the seed of Abraham is for the blessing to all the families of the earth; as the last Adam, the unique seed of Abraham became the life-giving Spirit&mdash;Gen. 12:2-3, 7; 17:7-8; Gal. 3:14, 16, 29; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 12:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of Abraham, the seed of Abraham, dispensed into us to make us the sons of Abraham, the corporate seed of Abraham, those who can receive and inherit the consummated Spirit as the blessing of Abraham&mdash;Gal. 3:7, 14; 4:28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8), which is a type of the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17).</li>
		<li>Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the blessing of Abraham (Gal. 3:14), the reality of both the seed of Abraham and the good land promised to Abraham; our blessing today is God Himself, who is embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit to be dispensed into us for our enjoyment.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We can continually receive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit for His growth in us as the seed of Abraham and for our enjoyment of Him as the land promised to Abraham by the hearing of faith&mdash;vv. 2, 5; 2 Cor. 4:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To receive the Spirit, we need to have an ear to hear what the Spirit says to the churches (Rev. 2:7; cf. Heb. 5:11-14); the measure of the Spirit that can be dispensed into our inward parts depends on the measure of our hearing (Mark 4:23-25; Matt. 13:14-16; 5:3, 8; Luke 10:38-42).</li>
		<li>We need to be one with Christ as the Slave-Savior by loving Him to the uttermost and taking Him as our absolute consecration, giving Him the way to open our ear to hear His divine instructions, His fresh messages, which dispense the divine Spirit into us for our service to God in our spirit in the gospel of His Son&mdash;Exo. 21:1-6; Isa. 50:4-5; Phil. 3:3; John 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6; Rom. 1:9.</li>
		</ol></li>

<li>Christ as the seed of David refers to the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, who carries out God&rsquo;s eternal economy by dispensing Himself into the members of His Body so that they may reign in life to share His kingship as His co-kings&mdash;2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Rom. 1:3-4; 5:17; Rev. 20:4, 6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord of David in His divinity, the Root of David, was incarnated to become the son of David, the Offspring of David, in His humanity, to be the last Adam; and the last Adam, the son of David, was resurrected to become the firstborn Son of God and the life-giving Spirit, a transfigured descendant of David, dispensed into us to make us the many sons of God and co-kings of Christ&mdash;Matt. 22:41-46; Rev. 22:16; John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 12:24; Rom. 8:28-29; Acts 13:33; Rom. 5:17.</li>

		<li>We are being saved in His life to be deified for the expression of God, and we are reigning in life by the abundance of grace in the church as the kingdom of God to be victorious for the dominion of God&mdash;vv. 10, 17; 14:17.</li>
		<li>Such an organic salvation is in the Body for the building up of the Body in the local churches to consummate the New Jerusalem as the city of life and the ultimate consummation of God becoming man that man might become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of David, the seed of David, dispensed into us as God&rsquo;s sure mercies, His eternal covenant, for our enjoyment&mdash;Isa. 55:1-3, 6-11; Acts 13:33-35:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Acts 13:34 Paul interprets God&rsquo;s sure mercies (Heb. <em>chesed</em>) in Isaiah 55:3 as &ldquo;the holy things of David, the faithful things,&rdquo; and in Acts 13:33 and 35 he indicates that these things are the resurrected Christ Himself as the firstborn Son of God and as the Holy One.</li>
		<li>This is also confirmed by Isaiah 55:4, which reveals that the sure mercies are Christ Himself as the Witness, Leader, and Commander to the peoples.</li>
		<li>The resurrected Christ as the seed of David (Rom. 1:3-4) is God&rsquo;s sure mercies shown to David through his descendant Mary, the mother of Christ (Matt. 1:16), for the dispensing of Himself into all His believers (1 Cor. 15:45b) so that they may experience Him as the abundance of grace to reign in life over Satan, sin, and death (Rom. 5:17, 21).</li>
		<li>He is the mercies and blessings, &ldquo;the holy and faithful things,&rdquo; that God gives to us as a great gift, the eternal covenant with all His unsearchable riches, to be our all-inclusive grace&mdash;Isa. 42:6; 1 Cor. 1:9; cf. Acts 13:43.</li>
		<li>Our spirit is the &ldquo;bank account&rdquo; of all the bequests of the new covenant; by the law of the Spirit of life, all these bequests are dispensed into us and made real to us&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 10, 6, 11, 16; Heb. 8:10; John 16:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of David, the seed of David, dispensed into us for us to share in His kingship in His resurrection in the eternal kingdom of God&mdash;2 Tim. 2:12a; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li>
	<li>The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the transfigured descendant of David, the seed of David, the seed of the kingdom, dispensed into us to make us the sons of the kingdom, reigning in life to live in the reality of the kingdom so that we may be translated by Him and return with Him in the manifestation of the kingdom as the corporate smiting stone to annihilate the kingdoms of this world and become a great mountain, the kingdom of God, that fills the whole earth&mdash;Mark 4:26; Matt. 13:18-23, 38, 43; Heb. 11:5-6; Gen. 5:21-24; Dan. 2:34-35.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to enjoy and proclaim Christ as the threefold seed in humanity, we need to enter into the following charges to the believers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must be identified with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension so that we can live in our spirit to be one spirit with Him&mdash;Rom. 6:3-5; Eph. 2:6; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>We must receive God&rsquo;s constant and instant dispensing continuously through unceasing prayer, not quenching the Spirit&mdash;1 Thes. 5:17, 19.</li>
	<li>We must live in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection through His cross in our spirit to dispense Him into others for the sake of His Body&mdash;Phil. 3:10.</li>
	<li>We must overcome individualism, sectarianism, and the degradation of Christianity, and we must live the life of the Body of Christ&mdash;Rev. 2:26-27; 3:21.</li>
	<li>We must live Him as the pneumatic Christ by the bountiful supply of His Spirit, the supply of the Body, for the furtherance of the gospel&mdash;Phil. 1:5, 19b-21a; Psa. 133.</li>
	<li>We must be filled with the Spirit within and without, and we must live and walk according to the Spirit in our spirit for the advancement of the gospel of Christ as the threefold seed in humanity&mdash;the good news of the revelation of the entire Bible&mdash;Acts 13:52; 4:31b; Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4b; Phil. 1:12.</li>
