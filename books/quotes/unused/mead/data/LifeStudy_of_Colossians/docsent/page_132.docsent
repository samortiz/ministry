   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR HAVING BEEN ROOTED IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO GROW WITH THE GROWTH OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 2:6, 7, 19; 1:28; Eph 4:15-16, 13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because we have been grafted into Christ, we have entered into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our entrance into Christ is related to life and to the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not enter into Christ in the same way that we walk into a room.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Walking into a room has nothing to do with either life or growth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, entering into Christ involves the process of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Romans 6:5 Paul says that we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we are growing with Christ in the likeness of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GRAFTING AND GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that it is in baptism that we grow together with Christ in the likeness of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Baptism is not a lifeless ritual; it is an experience that is very much related to life and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we baptize believers, we should help them realize that in baptism they will grow together with Christ, because they have been grafted into the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ s crucifixion provided an opening in Him for us to be grafted into Him, and His resurrection ushers us into the process of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now that we have been grafted into Christ, we should grow in Him day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1 Corinthians 3 Paul also speaks of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 9 he points out that the believers are God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 6 he says, I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the growth Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>. This implies that the saints are plants in God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the church, God s farm, we are plants growing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The concept of growing like plants is also found in Romans 11, where Paul uses the illustration of grafting a branch from a wild olive tree into a cultivated olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the eyes of God, we all are plants, or trees.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Romans 6:5 Paul uses a particular Greek word to indicate growth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is very difficult to find an English equivalent for this word, which means to grow by being planted or grafted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both planting and grafting are for growth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A tree is planted in the soil so that it may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, the purpose of grafting is growth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Recently, a brother pointed out a marvelous definition of this Greek word found in Commentary on Romans by Frederick Louis Godet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Godet p.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>243 , the word denotes the organic union in virtue of which one being shares the life, growth, and phases of existence belonging to another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through the organic union of two plants, accomplished by grafting, the one plant partakes of the life and characteristics of the other plant.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a wonderful way of growth!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Applying this definition to our spiritual experience, we may say that we have been grafted into the tree of the all-inclusive, life-giving, processed Triune God, who is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Having become one with Him through grafting, we now partake of the life and characteristics of this all-inclusive One, and in this way we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>ROOTED IN THE LIVING LAND</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the book of Colossians there are implications that believers are to grow like plants rooted in the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to understand the Bible, we need to understand both the direct meaning of the words and also the implications.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes the revelation expressed through the implications of a verse is deeper than that conveyed in the direct statements.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is true of Colossians 2:6 and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 7 speaks of our having been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This implies that, in God s eyes, we are plants.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who have been baptized into Christ are plants rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The phrase having been rooted and being built up in Him is related to those who are walking in the preceding verse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are to walk in Christ, having been rooted and being built up in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that we are to walk by having been rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have not been rooted in Him, we cannot walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As living plants, we are walking plants.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We walk by being rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What wonderful, mysterious plants Christians are!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are plants who both walk and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some may think that it is not logical to say, on the one hand, that we can be rooted and, on the other hand, that we walk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How can one who has been rooted in Christ also walk in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The answer is that the land in which we are rooted is a living land.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since we have been rooted in a living, moving land, we live and move in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, it is not actually that we do the walking, but it is the land which moves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Praise the Lord that we are rooted in Christ who is the living land!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because the land moves, we can move also.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the implication of these verses, it is proper to speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not think that we are the ones walking in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we try to walk, we shall stumble and fall.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we may be defeated by Satan and led astray.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should regard ourselves as plants rooted in Christ as our living land.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As those who have been rooted in Him, we walk as He moves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is to walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Colossians 2:6 says to walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This adverbial phrase modifies the word walk.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It indicates that we cannot walk in Christ unless we have been rooted in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thus, we walk in the living land in which we have been rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As we consider 2:6 and 7, we see that to grow in Christ is to walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have pointed out that having been rooted and being built up in Him is related to the word walk.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This phrase gives us the meaning of walking in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because we have been rooted in the moving Christ, we walk in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The fact that walking in Christ is a matter of growing is indicated by the word rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Plants are rooted in the soil for the purpose of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a tree is to grow, it must be properly rooted.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Without roots, a tree will die, for it has no way to absorb moisture from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A tree is able to grow, however, when it absorbs moisture through its roots.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although the rooting is for the growing, 2:6 does not speak of growing, but of walking in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, the implied significance of these terms is that genuine growth consists of our walking in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not grow by walking in ourselves; we grow by walking in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have seen that if we would walk in Him, we must first be rooted in Him as the living land.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then we walk as He moves and acts.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Such a walk is genuine growth.</S>
