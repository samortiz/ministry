   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO CHRIST THE ANSWER TO HUMAN PROBLEMS Psalms 3 to 8 Scripture Reading: Psa 3:4; 5:7, 11; 8:1-9; Heb 2:6-10; Eph 1:22-23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we proceed from Psalm 2 to Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you have not seen the difference between Psalm 1 and Psalm 2, it is rather difficult to go on to Psalm 8.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, before going on to Psalm 8, we must dwell a little more upon Psalms 1 and 2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapter one we boldly declared that Psalm 1 is not so positive, especially to us as Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are for Psalm 1, you should be an Old Testament saint.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You do not belong here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the church life we must have the New Testament saints, not the Old Testament ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE LAW VERSUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have pointed out that in Book I of the Psalms, God's intention is to turn the seeking saints from the law to Christ that they may enjoy the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is certain that if you are for the law, it is rather difficult for you to enter the house to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must turn from the law to Christ; then we will be in the house of God and enjoy all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The book of Galatians was written for the very purpose of showing us the difference between the law and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time of its writing the Jewish elders were doing their utmost to bring the concept of the law into the churches as a distraction from Christ, a substitute for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the apostle Paul wrote this letter, telling the saints that the law is something of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now Christ is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not for the law; we are now for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Galatians 3:24 says that the law was our schoolmaster, or, according to a better translation, our child conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>See Conybeare's translation of the Epistles of the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In ancient times, according to Jewish custom, the parents sent their children to a teacher living in a certain house by means of a servant as a child conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul here likens the law to the child conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"The law was our child conductor to bring us unto Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is the teacher; the law is the conductor to lead us to Christ that we may be justified by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a child conductor" v. 25 . Christ is come, and Christ dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The conductor is past; we need the conductor no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Galatians 5:4 says, "Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you attempt to keep the law, Christ is become of no effect to you, and you are fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are you still for the law?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If so, the consequence is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The problem of the law issues mainly from two sources: 1 our human, natural, and religious concept, and 2 the poverty of even fundamental Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many times in Christendom, after people have been brought to grace, they have been helped immediately to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They have been ushered into a situation of half-grace and half-law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christians say that they know grace, but they know only fifty percent grace, and, I venture to say, even less than fifty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Grace must be one hundred percent; there is no element of law in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you are still for the law, you are fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not my word or teaching, but my quotation from the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the very concept of God Himself in His Word, especially the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Galatians 2:19, Paul said, "For I through the law am dead to the law."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why do you love the law so much?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Are you married to the law?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I know that when I say Psalm 1 is not so good, many of you will disagree.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first time I spoke of Psalm 1 in this way was in 1956.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At that time I offended a number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we did not have the New Testament, but only the Psalms, you may win the case.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But today, hallelujah, we have the Psalms, and we also have the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Old Testament is just a picture book; the New Testament is the definition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have the boldness to say that this concept is right, because it is the concept of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through the law I am dead to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How could your Christian conscience justify you in delighting in the law?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through the law I am dead to the law; I have nothing to do with the law that I might live unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let us go on to Romans 10:4.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Are you clear concerning the law?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is the end of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then what about Psalm 1?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Psalm 2 is the end of Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you have Psalm 2, you may forget about Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the Lord Jesus was on the mountain of transfiguration, Peter spoke nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He said, "Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah" Matt 17:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Moses was the representative of the law, and Elijah the representative of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After Peter spoke these words, there came a voice from the heavens, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then Moses and Elijah disappeared; only Christ was there.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And we read that when they had lifted up their eyes, "they saw no man, save Jesus only."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There was no more law, no more prophets, only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You see, if you still treasure Psalm 1, it means that you are pitching two tents, one for Christ and one for Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>That is nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must hear the voice from the heavens, saying, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him" only Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We may even be so bold as to say that we must put Psalm 2 upon our head and Psalm 1 under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How could we put part of the Bible under our feet?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is not my thought, but the thought of the Bible itself.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Turn to Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There we see a wonderful, universal woman.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"And there appeared a great sign in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars" v. 1 . This woman represents all the chosen people of God; she will eventually become the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>She is clothed with the sun, the moon is under her feet, and upon her head are twelve stars.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What are these?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They are three different dispensations: the dispensation of the sun, the dispensation of the moon, and the dispensation of the twelve stars.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Undoubtedly, the New Testament age is the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The moon is the Old Testament, the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The moon is good, but it is much inferior to the sun; likewise, the law is good, but it is far inferior to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now we are in the age of the sun; the age of the moon, the law, is under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The dispensation of the stars is the age of the patriarchs.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>These are the three dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The age of the patriarchs was the period of the forefathers before the law, from the time of Adam or Abel to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then from Moses to Christ is the age of the moon that is the night time.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then Christ came; Christ is the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When Christ came, the day dawned, the sun arose.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must realize the position of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The age of the law is under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the concept of the Bible.</S>
