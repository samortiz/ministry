<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FIRST CORINTHIANS 3:10-16</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 3:10-16 Paul speaks of the grace of God [the Triune God] given to Him (v. 10), the foundation laid being [the Son] Jesus Christ (v. 11), and the Spirit of God dwelling in us as the temple of God (v. 16). This portion of the Word describes how the church comes into being and how the church exists. It shows the move of the Divine Trinity to have the church for His corporate expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FIRST THESSALONIANS 1:4-7</H2><P>In 1 Thessalonians 1:4-7 Paul told the believers that they were beloved by God [the Father], that the gospel came to them in power and in the Holy Spirit&#151;with the joy of the Holy Spirit, so that they became imitators of the Lord [the Son]. After we have received the gospel in the power of the Spirit and with the joy of the Spirit, we become imitators of the Lord. This portion shows the activity of the Divine Trinity in the service of the gospel.</P><P>All the portions in the New Testament which we have pointed out should give us a clear view that the New Testament is fully composed of and structured with the Divine Trinity. The Bible presents us a picture of the move of the Divine Trinity for the accomplishment of His economy that we might be wrought to fit His economy.</P>
