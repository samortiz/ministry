<p><i>Hymns,</i> #437 (stanzas 1 and 6 with the chorus) says:</p><p class="hbody">Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?<br />Is not thine a captured heart?<br />Chief among ten thousand own Him;<br />Joyful choose the better part.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captivated by His beauty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worthy tribute haste to bring;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let His peerless worth constrain thee,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crown Him now unrivaled King.<br /><br />&lsquo;Tis that look that melted Peter,<br />&lsquo;Tis that face that Stephen saw,<br />&lsquo;Tis that heart that wept with Mary,<br />Can alone from idols draw:</p><p>Only the face of tears that Peter saw, only the face of glory into which Stephen looked, and only the heart that wept with Mary can keep us away from the idols, the attractions, of this world. The Bible tells us that Jesus wept with Mary (John 11:35). Have you ever heard that God weeps? Many say that Jesus came to express God, but they mainly refer to the miracles He did, not to the tears that He shed.</p><p>Dear saints, my burden in this message is to share that you have to start seeking the Lord in a personal and affectionate way. I want to stress these two words: <i>personal</i> and <i>affectionate.</i> The very God whom we pursue is personal and affectionate.</p><p>I have been in the Lord's fellowship for about seventy years, but there was one particular occasion when the Lord touched me in the most personal and affectionate way. In 1943 Japan invaded and occupied China. One day the military police of the invading Japanese army arrested me and imprisoned me for thirty days. Every day I was subjected to two very stern and strict examinations. At that time the Chinese knew how cruel the invading Japanese army was. They would kill a Chinese as they would a chicken. I do not believe that there were many Chinese who were arrested by the Japanese army and released after thirty days. All my relatives, friends, and brothers and sisters in the church were very concerned for my life.</p><p>On the first day of my imprisonment, the Japanese military police put me into a soldier's bedroom; that night the Lord gave me a dream, indicating to me that the Japanese army would not hurt me. The next day they began to interrogate me. They threatened to pour cold water upon me if I did not tell the truth. I said to myself, &ldquo;You don't need to threaten me, because I will surely speak the truth. I am a man of truth.&rdquo; After many times of their testing, they could not find anything wrong with me. After fifteen days of being imprisoned, I was alone in my small cell in the night. I stood up and I can testify that the Lord was in my presence embracing me. I said with tears, &ldquo;Lord, You know why I am here.&rdquo; This experience of the Lord was personal to the uttermost. In my whole life I never had a time like that in which the Lord was so personal to me. I was so personal and affectionate to Him, and He was the same to me.</p><p>We all need this kind of personal, affectionate, intimate contact with the Lord every day. This has become my habit. Every morning after rising up I go to my desk and the first thing I say is, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You.&rdquo; I am not just a poor man praying to a merciful God, but I am contacting a Savior who is personal and affectionate to me, as I am personal and affectionate to Him. We all need to take heed to what the seeker says: &ldquo;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!&rdquo; Right away her tone changes: &ldquo;Your love is better than wine.&rdquo; This is a personal, intimate prayer. &ldquo;Draw me; we will run after you.&rdquo; This is personal and affectionate. We need this kind of personal and affectionate seeking after Him, and we need to build up such a relationship with Him that is so personal and affectionate.</p>
