There is no need for you to pray, "O Lord, come in and take me over." Simply call on Him and tell Him you love Him. Tell Him He is so sweet to you. Tell Him He is so lovely to you. "O Lord Jesus, I just love You. Show me Your beauty. Show me Your fairness. Show me Your sweetness. Cause me to have the full sense of Your sweetness." If you are going to pray, you should pray in this way.</P><P>You should forget about all other things. If you have a bad temper, forget about that. If you cannot love others, forget about that. If you cannot serve or function, forget about that. When I was young, I frequently asked the Lord to make me capable in my ministry and in my service and work for Him. I would not say that those prayers were not good, but today I have a simple way to pray. The more I grow in the Lord, the more simple the way I contact the Lord becomes. I simply say, "O Lord Jesus, I love You. I just love You. You are so sweet to me." Try to say this one hundred times tomorrow, then come to the meeting and see what will come out. We need to say, "Lord Jesus, I love You. O Lord Jesus, I love You. I just love You. You are so sweet. Reveal Yourself to me. Show me Your beauty. Capture me, Lord, with Your beauty. I want to be crazy by being wrecked with Your beauty." Then you will see what will come out in the meeting. You will be the first one, even the best one, to function.</P><P>Galatians 2:20 says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." Just to know this doctrine, however, does not work. You have to contact Him. Open up yourself to Him by appreciating His beauty, His loveliness, His fairness, and His sweetness. Especially you young people have to pray that the Lord would attract you, wreck you, and capture you. Today this generation does not need many ministers but many lovers of Jesus. I do not want to be a minister. I want to be a lover of Jesus. You young people have to be the lovers of Jesus. You must be aware that the enemy, the subtle one, will beguile you by tempting you to serve the Lord. You may say that you are learning how to serve the Lord, but the Lord does not need you to serve Him. The Lord needs you to love Him.</P><P>On the seashore of Tiberias, the Lord Jesus asked Peter, "Simon Peter, do you love Me? Do you love Me more than all the others?" (John 21:15). The Christian life is not a matter of work for Him or of serving Him. Forget about all this. Satan, the subtle one, would come in to beguile you by tempting you to serve the Lord. Today in this generation the Lord Jesus does not need a lot of young people to work for Him. He needs many young ones to love Him desperately. If you love Him for just half a day, you will be crazy. Today the Lord Jesus needs many crazy lovers.</P><P>In Christianity there has been too much work, too much human service. They even call their meeting a service. We need to realize, however, that our meetings are a feast. We meet to feast on Jesus by loving Him. We need to be attracted by Him. To all of our senses nothing should be so sweet, so precious, so attractive, and so amazing as Jesus.</P><P>All of you young brothers and sisters have to pray for this. You should pray, "Lord Jesus, cause me to love You. Show me Your loveliness. Show me Your beauty. Show me Your fairness. Show me Your sweetness." The name of Jesus should be so sweet to you. If all the young people would be wrecked by the loveliness of Christ, this would affect the entire nation. We do not need preachers, ministers, or pastors. We need the lovers of Jesus.</P><P>Today's generation is a generation of pleasure lovers. People today love all kinds of entertainment, amusement, and worldly enjoyment. We are not like this. We are the crazy lovers of Jesus. We do not care for entertainment, amusement, or worldly enjoyment. We are not for any kind of sport. Our sport is Jesus. Jesus is all the entertainment to us. Are you really crazy to such an extent?</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Living and Practical Way to Enjoy Christ &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
