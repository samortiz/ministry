<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. Concerning Truth, Wisdom, and Knowledge</H2><P>There is gold and an abundance of corals, but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel (20:15). In 24:13-14 the writer says, "My son, eat honey, for it is good,/And the drippings from the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:/Know that wisdom is such for your soul;/If you find it, then there will be a latter end,/And your hope will not be cut off." Through wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established, and by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches (vv. 3-4). Whoever loves wisdom makes his father glad (29:3a). Proverbs 23:23 charges us, saying, "Buy truth, and do not sell it;/Buy wisdom and instruction and understanding." Verse 19 says, "Listen, my son, and be wise,/And direct your heart in the way."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>15. Concerning Forbearance and Softness</H2><P>By forbearance a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue can break the bone (25:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>16. Concerning Working</H2><P>Proverbs 22:29 says, "Do you see a man skilled in his work?/He will stand before kings;/He will not stand before obscure men." The plans of the diligent lead only to plentifulness, but everyone who is hasty comes only to want (21:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>17. Concerning Correcting the Children</H2><P>Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction will drive it far from him (22:15). The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother (29:15). Proverbs 23:13-14 says, "Do not withhold correction from a child;/If you beat him with the rod, he will not die./If you beat him with the rod,/You will deliver his soul from Sheol." Proverbs 22:6 charges us to train up a child according to the way he should go; even when he is old, he will not depart from it. Finally, 29:17 admonishes us, saying, "Correct your son, and he will give you rest;/He will also give delight to your soul."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>18. Concerning Stripes and Reproof</H2><P>Stripes that wound purge away evil, and strokes reach the innermost parts of the inner being (20:30). He who hardens his neck after being often reproved will suddenly be broken beyond remedy (29:1).</P>
