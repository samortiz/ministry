   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS WHEAT IN OUR LIMITATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all know what it means to be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Married life, for example, is a limitation and a restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Marriage certainly places limitations on us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the young people may be free as the birds in the air, they experience limitations when they get married.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although you may be as free as a bird today, you will find yourself in a cage after you get married.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every wife is a cage to her husband, and every husband is a cage to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before I was married, I kept my bedroom window open at night because I enjoyed the fresh air.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But my wife would close all the windows and turn the bedroom into a cage.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before I was married I had the freedom to spend as much time as I wanted reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I could study the Bible from 7 p.m. until 2 a.m. However, after I was married, my time spent in studying the Bible in the evening was limited.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At 9:30 my wife would want the lights turned out because she felt it was time to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although we may not always be happy in the cage of our married life, there is no escape from it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For us Christians, there is no divorce or separation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot flee the cage of married life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After a period of time, some little birds are born into this cage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What a further restriction this is!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the years went by and children were born, I experienced many more limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I cried out to the Lord and said, O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord seemed to say, Simply be limited and restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Look at Me. Although I am the unlimited God, I was incarnated and limited for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can promise you that after thirty years you will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One day, thirty years later, I said to the Lord, Lord, You told me that I would be released after thirty years, but now I am more limited than ever.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have not only sons and daughters, but daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, and grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I also have the limitation of so many churches and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, what shall I do now?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the Lord said, Look at Me again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although I was released after thirty years, don t you know that I am still being limited by you and all the other believers?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, I saw the vision of Christ as the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The very Christ who indwells me is the incarnated One.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a sense, He is still incarnated today, for the indwelling Christ is willing to be limited, caged, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I saw this vision of the limited Christ, I began to worship Him, saying, O Lord, thank You for my wife, for all my children, for all the churches, and for all the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How I thank You, Lord, for my cage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a prayer causes wheat to begin to grow immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I can testify that I have a wheat field in my Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How I thank the Lord for my wife, my children, my in-laws, my grandchildren, the churches, and the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All these produce the environment that enables me to grow wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The young brothers and sisters who soar like birds in the air do not have any wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever they come to a meeting of the church, they fly freely, but they do not have any wheat in their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But after they get married and experience Christ in their limitations, the limited Jesus will begin to grow in them as wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers who take responsibility in the churches are also limited by one another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this limitation gives Christ the opportunity to grow in them as wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This wheat is the incarnated Jesus growing in the midst of our limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>LIMITATION LEADING TO CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, these limitations will put us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Limitation always leads to crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Husbands and wives not only limit each other; they also crucify each other.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without exception, every husband crucifies his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are honest, you will admit that you have crucified your wife many times.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But how good it is to be crucified!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more we are crucified, the more the wheat grows within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The way to eat Christ as wheat is to be limited and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you are not willing to be limited and crucified, you will not have any wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There will be no need for you to talk about how to eat the wheat because there will not be any wheat to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You must grow the wheat before you can eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And in order to grow wheat you must be limited and crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hallelujah for this limitation and crucifixion!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Paul said, For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus sake 2 Cor 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Day after day, the wives and the husbands deliver one another to death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although your honeymoon may have been very sweet, I am sure that it did not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I do not know of any honeymoon that has lasted for even thirty days.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It seems that the honeymoon often becomes a vinegar-moon.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although you may tell your wife that you love her, you are ready to crucify her several days later.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>During the first few days of your honeymoon you may say, Dear, I love you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But after those days, you will feel like saying, I will nail you to the cross and put you to death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This kind of crucifixion does not take place once for all; it is continual.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>My wife has crucified me many times.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whenever I think that this crucifixion will be over once and for all, I am crucified again a few days later.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the experience of the incarnated and crucified Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we experience Jesus as the limited One and as the crucified One, He grows in us as wheat.</S>
