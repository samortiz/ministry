   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIGHT AND LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The divine supply that comes to us through the Word has a particular expression, and this expression is the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever we receive the Lord s word into us, the essence of the divine supply comes in with light as its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the supply comes, light comes with it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From experience we know that whenever we receive the Lord s word, we have light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Light is the essence of God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the light, that is, in the essence of God s expression, we have love as the essence of God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the way to enjoy the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We receive the Word, and light comes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever light comes, love is spontaneously present.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With this love which we enjoy in the divine light, we first love God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We love Him not by our own love, by our natural love, but by His own love which we experience and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, when we love God, we also love every one begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that when we love the Father, we love His children.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, in this way we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we love the brothers, we spontaneously have the desire to participate in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In particular, we want to be in the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we receive the Lord s word through pray-reading, we receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then in the light we have love for God and for all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we do not receive the Word and thus are not in the light with the love, we may be rather indifferent toward the saints and toward the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Should we meet a brother in the Lord, we may not even have the desire to greet him warmly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when we receive the Word and are in the light, spontaneously we experience God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have the strong sense within that we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then if we meet a brother, we shall have the feeling that he is lovable and that we love him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our response to him will be a response of love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of being cold or indifferent, we shall have a genuine feeling of warmth toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>LOVE, FELLOWSHIP, AND THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to have the fellowship that is for the church life, we need brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would have this love, we need to know the Lord experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As those who know the Lord, we need to take His word again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we take the Word, we receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this light we spontaneously have love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This love is a strong indication that we also have the Lord Himself, for love is the essence of God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As light is the nature of God s expression, love is the nature of God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that when we have God s love, we actually have God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With this love, the divine love experienced and enjoyed by us, we love God and His children.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we have this love for God and for the children of God, we have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we have pointed out, this love actually is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Love is both a condition of the divine fellowship and the result of experiencing this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The love that issues from the divine light, the light that comes when we receive the Lord s word in our knowing of Him, is the very fellowship that is for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May we all have this love, the love of God, perfected in us so that we may maintain the divine fellowship for the church life.</S>
