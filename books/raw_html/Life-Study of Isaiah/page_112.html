<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehovah Confirming the Word of His Servant<br>and Fulfilling the Counsel of His Messengers</H2><P>Jehovah confirms the word of His servants and fulfills the counsel of His messengers. Jehovah also says to Jerusalem, "She will be inhabited," and to the cities of Judah, "They will be built," and "I will raise up their ruins" (v. 26). He says to the depths, "Be dried up," and "I will dry up your rivers" (v. 27). Furthermore, Jehovah says to Cyrus, "He is My shepherd," indicating that Cyrus is God's shepherd for the shepherding of Israel. Jehovah also says to Cyrus, "He will fulfill all My desire." Cyrus will do this by saying of Jerusalem, "She will be built," and of the temple, "Her foundations will be laid" (v. 28). These words are pleasant to God's ears.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. A SERVANT AND A WITNESS OF JEHOVAH</H2><P>Isaiah 45 speaks regarding a servant of Jehovah and a witness of Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Servant of Jehovah</H2><P>In this chapter a servant of Jehovah is raised up by Jehovah in righteousness (v. 13a). He is called by Jehovah (vv. 3b, 4b) and chosen by Jehovah (42:1a) for the sake of Jehovah's servant, Israel (45:4a). He is anointed by Jehovah (v. 1a) to subdue the nations (vv. 1b-2), to build Jehovah's city of Jerusalem (v. 13b; cf. Neh. 2:5-6), and to send away Jehovah's captives of Israel, neither for a price nor for a reward (Isa. 45:13c; Luke 4:18c).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. A Witness of Jehovah</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Testify That Jehovah Is "Jehovah"<br>and That Besides Jehovah There Is No God</H2><P>A witness of Jehovah testifies that only Jehovah is "Jehovah" and "there is no one else" (Isa. 45:5a). Besides Jehovah there is no God. Jehovah is the One "who forms the light and creates darkness" and "who makes peace and creates evil" (v. 7). Here evil refers to the lack of peace.</P><P>Isaiah 45:8 says, "Drip down, O heavens, from above,/ And let the clouds flow down righteousness;/Let the earth open/And bring forth salvation and righteousness;/Let them spring forth together;/I, Jehovah, have created it." What does it mean to say that the clouds will "flow down righteousness"? This means that the Spirit will flow down to dispense Christ as righteousness into the people on earth. The earth here signifies human beings. Thus, for the earth to be opened is for people to be opened. On the one hand, God causes the Spirit to flow down from heaven to impart Christ as righteousness into us; on the other hand, God causes us as the earth to open and bring forth salvation and righteousness, both of which are Christ Himself. In this verse, therefore, we have a description of how God carries out His salvation. God carries out His salvation by using His Spirit to bring down Christ as righteousness and by opening us to receive Christ as salvation and righteousness.</P><P>Jehovah is "a God who hides Himself" (v. 15). Even today, God is still hiding. Jehovah is also the Savior of Israel, the Savior of those "who have escaped from the nations" (vv. 15, 20a). However, those who make idols will be ashamed and go in confusion (v. 16).</P>
