   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCES.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Greek the word rendered "heresies" in Galatians 5:20 KJV does not necessarily convey the thought of error, but rather of division on the ground of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Interlinear New Testament translates it as "sects," while Darby in his New Translation renders it "schools of opinion."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The whole thought here is not of the difference between truth and error, but of division based upon doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My teaching may be right or it may be wrong, but if I make it a cause of division, then I am guilty of the "heresy" spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God forbids any division on doctrinal grounds.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some believe that rapture is pre-tribulation; others, that it is post- tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some believe that all the saints will enter the kingdom; others believe that only a section will enter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some believe that baptism is by immersion; others, that is by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some believe that supernatural manifestations are a necessary accompaniment to the baptism in the Holy Spirit, while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>None of these doctrinal views constitute a scriptural basis for separating the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Though some may be right and others wrong, God does not sanction any division on account of difference as to such beliefs.1 If a group of believers split off from a local church in their zeal for certain teaching according to the Word of God, the new "church" they establish may have more scriptural teaching, but it could never be a scriptural church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To bring error into a church is carnal, but to divide a church on account of error may also be carnal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is carnality that so often destroys the oneness of the church in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we wish to maintain a scriptural position, then we must see to it that the churches we found in various places only represent localities, not doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our "church" is not separated from other children of God on the ground of locality alone, but stands for the propagation of some particular doctrine, then we are decidedly a sect, however true to the Word of God our teaching may be.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of God is that a church should represent the children of God in a locality, not represent some specific truth there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A church of God in any place comprises all the children of God in that place, not merely those who hold the same doctrinal views.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Should we arrive at a place where a church has already been established on clear local ground, and discover that its members hold views which we consider unscriptural, or that they consider the views we hold as unscriptural, if we then refuse to recognize them as the church of God in that locality and withdraw from fellowship, we are divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The question is not whether they agree with our presentation of truth, but whether they are standing on clear church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our hearts are set to preserve the local character of the churches of God, we cannot fail to come up against problems in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unless the cross operates mightily, what endless possibilities of friction there will be if we include in one church all the believers in the locality with all their varying views.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How the flesh would like just to include those holding the same views, and to exclude all whose views differ from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To have constant and close association with people whose interpretation of Scripture does not tally with ours, is hard for the flesh, but good for the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God does not use division to solve the problem; He uses the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He would have us submit to the cross, so that through the very difficulties of the situation, the meekness and patience and love of Christ may be deeply wrought into our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Under the circumstances, if we do not know the cross, we shall probably argue, lose our temper, and finally go our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may have right views, but God is giving us an opportunity to display a right attitude; we may believe aright, but God is testing us to see if we love aright.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is easy to have a mind well stored with scriptural teaching, and a heart devoid of true love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who differ from us will be a means in God's hand to test whether we have spiritual experience, or only scriptural knowledge, to test whether the truths we proclaim are a matter of life to us, or mere theory.</S>
