   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, we who are in the old creation need to be renewed by allowing God to infuse into us His attributes, which are forever new, can never become old, and are everlasting and unfading, in order to transform our old creation into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the experienced ones know that in our fellowship with God, there is always an infusion taking place within us; that is, the attributes of God are being infused into our nature, which belongs to the old creation, to renew it.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit of God renews the believers by causing them to pass through the death of Christ on the cross, the discipline of the Spirit of God in the environment, and the metabolic dispensing of the Spirit as life, that they may be renewed day by day 2 Cor 4:16 by putting off the oldness of the old creation and living out the newness of life of the new creation Rom 6:4 .</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be renewed is to have a new essence added into us to cause a metabolic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Transformation is the intrinsic and metabolic process of the working of God, which on the one hand is gradually eliminating our old and natural element, and on the other hand is spreading the life and nature of God throughout our entire being to be the new element of our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit of God transforms the believers metabolically with the life element of the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, who passed through death and entered into resurrection, until they are transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another higher degree of glory and are raptured and transfigured to enter into His glory Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we do not say "Christ" but "the firstborn Son of God," because we are being conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The firstborn Son of God is the prototype, and we, the many sons, are His mass reproduction.</S>
