   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICAL, NOT DOCTRINAL, PRIESTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suppose we are the people of Israel and we are having a feast in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There must be some who are the presenters, and surely some should be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Old Testament times some were priests and some were people, but today in the church all are priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But this can be merely doctrinal and not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In doctrine we all are priests, but in practice perhaps only two out of ten are the actual priests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are some who are just like the common people of Israel, because in the church meeting they do not function.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am afraid that too many attend the meeting with the desire and expectation to get something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They listen to the message and the testimonies, but they never realize that they must serve in the meeting as a functioning priest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But there are a number of brothers and sisters who do put their shoulder under the ark of the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They pray and are burdened for the meetings all day long, and when the time comes for the meeting, they are more and more burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, when they come to the meeting, they come to bear something, not just with the expectation to get something.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the meeting seems to be going down, they immediately exercise their spirit to pray that the Lord will uplift the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are ministering by bearing the responsibility; so they are the active priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever there is an offering in the meeting, these dear ones surely will enjoy the breast as the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They will enjoy the loving, tender part.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then from among the active serving ones who are the actual priesthood, there might be two or three who are ministering as I am doing now.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am the present serving one, burning the fat to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am the one who sprinkles the blood on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, I have the right to enjoy the breast, the shoulder, and the extra pieces of the different cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have the right to enjoy the wave offering and the heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a member of the priesthood, I enjoy the wave breast, and as a serving one, I can also enjoy the heave shoulder and the heave cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more you serve, the more you enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The less you serve, the less you enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you are not in the actual priesthood, you are just one among the people, and you miss the right to enjoy the wave breast.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And, of course, if you are not presently serving, you have no right to enjoy the heave shoulder and the heave cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So we all must be the attendants presenting something in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all must bring something as a peace offering to the feast of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no way that we can borrow an offering from others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What we bring depends entirely upon our experience and appreciation of Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Day by day, hour after hour, we must spend much time on Christ that we may have a real harvest of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then when we come to the meeting, we will have something of Christ to present to God as a peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The hidden part is for God's satisfaction; the loving part is for the stronger ones; the strengthening part is for the serving ones; and the major part is for all the clean ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we all will be faithful in this way, how rich and uplifting our meetings will be, and how different they will be from today's Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I do look to the Lord that all the meetings in the local churches will be like this.</S>
