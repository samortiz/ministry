In order that the father could see the son every day and be near to him and have fellowship with him, the father changed the meeting time to once a day. This is how our heavenly Father feels toward us. Therefore, we should come to the Father's throne of grace every day and ask Him to "give us today our daily bread" (Matt. 6:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN WESLEY'S FAITH</H2><P>Wesley once said, "When I first began to preach, I encountered many difficulties. My brother Charles many times said, `If the Lord would give me wings, I would fly away.' I always answered, `If the Lord wanted me to fly, He would certainly give me wings.'" "Fear ye not" (Exo. 14:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A SERMON THAT WAS NEVER DELIVERED</H2><P>A certain renowned professor at a university was very much admired by many people. One day he was sitting in his study. On his desk were many books, but the Bible was not among them. He was invited to speak at the university cathedral on the upcoming Sunday, and he was preparing for his sermon. He knew that many people would listen to his speaking, and the chancellor, the professors, and a few hundred students would be there. The famous professional people and merchants would also come to listen to him. The Sunday morning service at that cathedral, being famous for always having good music, was always well-attended by socially renowned persons. This being the case, the professor thought that he must do the best job possible, for he realized that his name was quite well-known also. A few of his colleagues had spoken there before and had been severely criticized. He could not afford to commit the same mistakes as they did. He had to say something new and timely. He was obviously trying to earn the praise of men instead of the praise of God.</P><P>He put his head in his hands and muttered quietly to himself. In the end, he exclaimed, "I have it!" and he took a piece of paper and wrote on it, "New Trends in Thinking." He said, "This will be my theme-New Trends in Thinking." Two weeks before that, another preacher had preached there. He was known as a fundamentalist, and what he spoke was mocked by others. The young men and women called him an "antiquity." Now that this professor was going to preach on new trends in thinking, he found this a chance to respond to what the other preacher had spoken. He knew that his audience would love to listen to such words.</P><P>Now he had to consider a little what he was going to say. But he needed one verse. According to the custom of the place, he must choose one Scripture verse to serve as the basis for the Sunday morning service. What verse should he choose? In the end, he chose Acts 17:19. "And they took hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is which is being spoken by you?" He said to himself, "Fortunately there is such a verse. I can take this opportunity to show them my knowledge concerning Greek history and language." He hurriedly wrote something down. After he had jotted something down concerning the Areopagus and Greek philosophy, he proceeded to write the first section of his sermon, "Old Concepts." He wrote, "There are some old concepts in religion that cannot stand in the eyes of modern scientific research. What our ancestors believed in is too old and antiquated. If the great ancient theologians were to come back to life today, they would give up their faith and agree with our new thoughts also." But what are the old concepts that he had to speak about? Here he thought he had a chance to rebut the word of the preacher who had spoken earlier. He wanted to find some points of faith from the unerring Book that he could make a mockery of. He wrote, "There is nothing in this world that is infallible. The word infallible means perfect, and it is impossible to be perfect. There is no book in this world that contains no mistakes, there is no truth in this world that can be unerring, and there is no one in this world who can be without error. Even Christ was not without error; He made some mistakes also." Then he proceeded, "The virgin birth of Jesus is a belief that cannot be explained by science. Neither is there any historical record concerning it. It is merely an unfounded story. As to resurrection, such a belief is rejected by great writers and scientists alike. All those with enlightened minds will no doubt understand Jesus' resurrection to be not a resurrection of the person, but a resurgence of His conduct, His personality, His guidance, and His pattern. The old concepts speak of a heaven and a place of suffering (hell) after death. This belief is quite illogical also. We do not know about our future. It is possible that after death there is a future life, but it may not be a kind of future life like that described in the Bible. We can never be certain of this."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
