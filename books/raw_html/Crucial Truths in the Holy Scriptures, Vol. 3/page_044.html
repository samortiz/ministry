	 <h2 class="head3">A Husband and a Wife Being a Symbol<br />
of Christ and the Church</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The two shall be one flesh. This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:31-32).</p>
<p>A husband and a wife, being one flesh, are a symbol of a great mystery, Christ and the church, and of the oneness between Christ and the church. Whenever we consider a husband and wife being one flesh, we should see the mystery of the oneness of Christ and the church.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;A husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church...But as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:23-25).</p>
<p>A husband, as the head of the wife, is a symbol of Christ as the Head of the church. Therefore, a wife being subject to her husband is a symbol of the church being subject to Christ, and a husband loving his wife is a symbol of Christ loving the church. Every proper relationship between husband and wife is a manifestation of the story of Christ and the church. Therefore, as husbands and wives, we should be careful to be proper husbands and wives in order to properly manifest the relationship between Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Children and Parents</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. &lsquo;Honor your father and mother...that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:1-3; see also Col. 3:20; Prov. 30:17).</p>
</h2>
<p>The second human relationship in the Bible is between children and parents. Just as the Bible speaks first of wives and then of husbands when referring to matters concerning husbands and wives, it speaks first of children and then of parents when referring to matters concerning parents and children. Obeying and honoring are the most important matters of a child&rsquo;s behavior toward his parents. This is fitting and pleasing to the Lord. When God first commanded man to honor his father and mother, He added a promise. The apostle says that this is the first commandment with a promise: If we honor our parents, it will be well with us, and we will live long. The earthly blessings of prosperity and longevity are gained by honoring one&rsquo;s parents. Conversely, Proverbs 30:17 says that those who do not honor their parents will lose the sight of their eyes, which means they will not receive light. Children, may this be a warning!</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Let them first learn to show respect toward their own household and to render a return to their parents&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 5:4).</p>
<p>Children should learn to show respect toward their own household and to render a return to their parents. The gift that parents give their children in raising them should not be despised or forgotten by the children. The children should respect and render a return to their parents. This is pleasing in the sight of God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:4; see also Col. 3:21).</p>
<p>Typically, fathers are strict with their children to the extent that the children are provoked to anger. Therefore, the Bible teaches that the most important matter for fathers in dealing with their children is not to provoke them to anger. A good father will not make his children angry or cause them to feel wronged. He will make his children happy and nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. However, it is not right for him to care merely for his children&rsquo;s happiness, neglecting the discipline and admonition of the Lord. Nevertheless, if he uses only the discipline of the Lord to teach them and ignores their feelings, he will be too dry. The secret of being a father is for him to care for his children&rsquo;s happiness and to nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Train the young women....to love their children&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 2:4; see also Prov. 13:24; 19:18; 22:6, 15; 29:15, 17).</p>
<p>In a father&rsquo;s treatment of his children, the Bible emphasizes not provoking them to anger and nurturing them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. In a mother&rsquo;s treatment, however, the emphasis is on love. Mothers can never be successful if they do not love their children. If a family does not have a mother&rsquo;s love, it can never be a good family. Without a mother&rsquo;s love, a family is crippled. Therefore, the young sisters who are mothers must learn to love their children.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Father and Children Being a Symbol<br />
of God the Father and His Children</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Father has given...that we should be called children of God; and we are&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:1, see also v. 2).</p>
<p>A father and his children symbolize God the Father and His children. God the Father loves us and gave us to be called children of God, and we are. He is a Father to us, and we are His children. This relationship is manifested by the mutual relationship and treatment of a father and his children. When we see a proper condition between a father and his children, we should be reminded of our mutual relationship with God the Father as His children.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If you...know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 7:11).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word in this verse clearly shows that fathers should be the symbol of God the Father. Human fathers know how to give good gifts to their children just as God the Father gives good gifts to us His children.</p>
