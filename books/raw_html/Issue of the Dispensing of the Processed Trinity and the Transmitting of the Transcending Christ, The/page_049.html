<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORGANIC AND UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST EXPRESSED IN MANY LOCAL CHURCHES</H2><P>The organic Body is undivided and it is also indivisible (1 Cor. 1:13a). It is not autonomous. This unique Body of Christ is expressed in many local churches (Rev. 1:11) in the divine oneness as it is with the Triune God (John 17:11, 21, 23) and in the divine nature, element, essence, expression, function, and testimony. There are many churches, yet they have one divine nature, one divine element, one divine essence, one divine expression, one divine function, and one divine testimony because they are one Body. This is why I say that our troubles are due to not seeing the Body. If we have seen the Body, there will be no problem. The principle and practice of the one Body are kept by the believers in the practical one accord (Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom. 15:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KEEPING THE DIVINE ONENESS<br>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>The divine oneness of the Body of Christ should be kept both in the local churches as the local expressions of the Body and in the universal source and substance. In every way we should keep the divine oneness of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONE CRUCIAL POINT OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY<br>IN THE CONSUMMATING AGE</H2><P>The genuine oneness of the Body of Christ is one crucial point of the Lord's recovery in this consummating age. The Lord is going to consummate His economy, so to keep the oneness is very crucial.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IGNORANCE CONCERNING THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>All the problems of the church today are due to the ignorance concerning the Body of Christ. Among us this ignorance should be absent, and the full knowledge should be present. We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation with the enlightening of the eyes of our heart to see and apprehend the Body of Christ.</P>
