   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Marriage,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Signifying the Continuation of Human Life,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and a Wedding Feast,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Signifying the Enjoyment of Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must allegorize the wedding and the wedding feast.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Marriage is very significant and essential to human life, for without it human life is hindered.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you eliminate marriage, you terminate human life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Marriage signifies the continuation of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What does the wedding feast signify?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It signifies the enjoyment and pleasure of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nothing on earth is a more joyful occasion than a wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Have you ever seen people weep mournfully at a wedding?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you were to weep in such a way at a wedding, it would mean that you are impolite or uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When attending a funeral, on the contrary, you are not permitted to be joyful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When attending a wedding, however, you must be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to human culture, a wedding is a joyful occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wine, as the Human Life,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Signifying the Basic Factor of This Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The marriage feast, whether in ancient times or in the present, whether in the East or in the West, depends primarily on wine, which typifies that all human pleasure depends on life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since wine, unlike water, derives its source from grapes, it comes from something living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Wine signifies life, for the wine of the grapes is the life of the grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the enjoyment of man depends upon the life of man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When life is brought to an end, all enjoyment is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. Their Human Life Running Out and</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Their Being Filled with Death</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although a wedding is a very joyful occasion, its joy is temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No wedding lasts very long.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Recently I attended a wedding which lasted a little longer than half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We were happy there for only half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the human wedding, the human enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Wine Ran Out</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The wine, which was the center of the enjoyment of the wedding feast, ran out 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This signifies that the enjoyment of human life will be terminated when human life runs out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the wine runs out, the pleasure of the marriage feast is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This signifies not only that the enjoyment of life is over, but that human life is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regardless of how much pleasure you are enjoying, when your human life is ended, all your human enjoyment is also gone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Regardless of how good your wife, your husband, your parents, your children, or your job may be, if your life has come to an end, your pleasure is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the wine has been exhausted, the feast is over, for the feast is dependent upon the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All your enjoyment depends upon your life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If your life has been terminated, your enjoyment is brought to an end. Regardless of the kind of wedding you are in, when your human life runs out, your wedding is terminated and the enjoyment is over.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That is what happened that day in Cana of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you not believe that before the Lord Jesus went to Cana He realized that the wine would run out?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Surely He knew it ahead of time, for that was the reason that He went to Cana.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The wine did not run out by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus foreknew that the wine would be exhausted, and He went to Cana to establish the principle of life, changing death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By coming to the marriage feast, He came to deal with and to heal the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord healed death in the human situation by turning it into life like the way Elisha healed the salt water by making it fresh 2 Kings 2:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the Lord came into the world, He came into a situation where human enjoyment existed, but was not lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He came into a situation where the death of human life terminates all human enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The changing of water into wine is a sign which must be understood figuratively.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, if we are over sixty years of age, we are approaching a time when the wine is almost gone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When our wine is about to run out, we know that our marriage feast will soon be over.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But, praise the Lord, it is at such a time that the Lord comes into our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In our marriage feast we have the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need not be afraid, for He can change the water into wine.</S>
