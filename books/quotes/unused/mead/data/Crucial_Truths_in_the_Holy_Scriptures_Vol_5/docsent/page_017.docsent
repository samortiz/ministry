   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Entering the Kingdom of the Heavens Being Different from Eternal Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By grace you have been saved Eph 2:8; see also 2 Tim 1:9 ; compare with The crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 2:8 and 2 Timothy 1:9 show that salvation is by grace on God s side and through faith on man s side.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Consequently, salvation is not at all related to our works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Grace is given by God freely, and we receive salvation freely by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We only need to believe and receive in order to receive God s salvation; we do not need to do even the smallest work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, 2 Timothy 4:8 shows that when the Lord comes, the crown that we obtain will be based on righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A crown is the symbol of a king.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, to obtain a crown is to enter the kingdom of the heavens to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, obtaining a crown is based on God s righteousness, not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is called a crown of righteousness, not a crown of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This crown of righteousness will be given by the Lord, the righteous Judge, to His overcoming believers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is absolutely different from being saved by grace in Ephesians 2:8.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By grace is based on our faith; of righteousness is based on our works.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God gives us grace for our salvation, and this has nothing to do with our works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We only need to receive God s salvation by faith, and we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the Lord will give us a crown based only on righteousness, according to our works.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to receive a crown, it is not enough merely to have faith to receive God s grace; we must also have works that correspond to the Lord s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, these two portions of the Bible show that we are saved by God s grace today and that we will obtain a reward and enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens according to God s righteousness in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These two matters are different from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Saved through faith...not of works Eph 2:8-9; see also 2 Tim 1:9 ; compare with Not everyone...will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens Matt 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians 2:8-9 and 2 Timothy 1:9 both say that salvation is entirely by God s grace, not by works.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This grace was given in Christ by God to us before the ages, before any of our works had been done, so it is completely unrelated to our works.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 7:21 tells us we must do works that carry out the will of the Father in order to enter the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, this also shows that entering the kingdom of the heavens is different from being eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Rom 10:13 ; compare with Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens Matt 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 10:13 says that whoever calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Calling upon the Lord s name in this verse is related to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as we believe in our heart and confess the Lord s name with our mouth, we will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not need to do anything else to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Believing in the Lord and confessing with our mouth are sufficient for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In contrast Matthew 7:21 says that not everyone who says, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is very different from Romans 10:13, which says that calling on the Lord s name is all that is needed for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the verse in Matthew 7, a person who calls, Lord, Lord, may not be able to enter the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While it is enough to call upon the name of the Lord for salvation, this is not sufficient to ensure that one will enter the kingdom of the heavens; it is also necessary to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, these two portions of the Bible also show that being eternally saved and entering the kingdom of the heavens are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such fornication...that someone has his stepmother...Such a one...may be saved 1 Cor 5:1, 5 ; Compare with Neither fornicators...will inherit the kingdom of God 1 Cor 6:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 1 Corinthians 5:5 the apostle spoke of delivering a brother who had committed gross fornication to Satan for the destruction of his flesh so that his spirit would be saved in the day of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This shows that a saved brother, even one who commits a terrible sin, will be saved in the future despite the destruction of his flesh in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is because salvation is based on God s unchanging grace, which will never change, even if a believer s actions are evil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a believer s actions are evil after he is saved, he is still saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is what the apostle clearly tells us in 1 Corinthians 5, but in the very next chapter the apostle says, Neither fornicators...nor adulterers...will inherit the kingdom of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This should be a clear indication that salvation and inheriting the kingdom of God are two different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they are not different, then the apostle s words contradict each other.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since salvation is not based on man s works, even a brother who becomes involved in fornication and adultery will not lose his eternal salvation, but at the same time he will not inherit the kingdom of God, which requires a surpassing holiness, because of his living as a fornicator and adulterer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, in these two portions, the apostle says two different things because being eternally saved and entering the kingdom of the heavens are two different matters.</S>
