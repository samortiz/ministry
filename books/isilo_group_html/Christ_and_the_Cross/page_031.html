<h1 class="title">THE POSITIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 12:24; Gen. 2:21-24; Eph. 5:25, 31-32; Luke 12:49-50</h1>
<p>In this chapter and in the following two chapters we will consider the function of the cross. In other words, we will consider the purpose of the cross and what the cross accomplished. The function of the cross has a positive aspect and a negative aspect. On the negative side, the cross solves God&rsquo;s problem, and on the positive side, the cross fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose. Although we generally look at the negative aspect of a matter first and then look at the positive aspect, we will begin with God&rsquo;s purpose to release and transmit life, which is the positive function of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE BEING<br />
TO RELEASE HIS ETERNAL LIFE</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the Bible, God&rsquo;s purpose is to release and impart His life into a group of people created by Him for this purpose. This purpose was determined in God in eternity according to His good pleasure (Eph. 1:5, 9). In order to fulfill this purpose, God made an eternal plan according to His will. Hence, His purpose is the purpose of His eternal plan.</p>
<p>The life of God is the eternal life. In the Bible the word <em>eternal</em> is related not only to time, having no beginning and no ending, but it is related also to measurement, being unlimited and immeasurable. Thus, when the Bible speaks of the eternal life of God (John 3:16), it is referring to the life that is not only without beginning and without ending but is also unlimited and immeasurable. In eternity it pleased God to release His unlimited life from within Himself into many people to be their life. This purpose pleases God because He desires to produce brothers for His Son with His life so that Christ would be glorified, and He would be expressed in Christ. The Bible reveals that God will fulfill this eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELEASE AND TRANSMISSION<br />
OF LIFE THROUGH DEATH BEING A LAW</h2>
<p>Life is released and transmitted through death. This is an important law revealed in the Bible: If a seed does not die, it cannot release its life, nor can it transmit its life to other seeds. Both plant life and animal life operate according to this law. If a silkworm does not pass through a death-like sleep, it will not turn into a moth, and it will not be able to release or transmit its life to produce more silkworms. If the shell of a chicken egg is not broken, a chicken cannot be produced, and it will not be able to release and transmit its life to produce more chickens.</p>
<p>In order for the life element of any living creature to enter as nutrients into human beings or into other animals, the living creature must die. God ordained that man would eat herbs, grains, and fruit as food for his sustenance (Gen. 1:29). However, all living plants must pass through death before the life element within them can become nutrients to us. Later, God gave animals to man in order to sustain his life (9:3), but the life element within an animal cannot enter into us as nutrients to sustain our life unless there is death. This is a requirement. If a cow, sheep, chicken, or duck does not die, it cannot enter into us as nutrients. In order for a living creature to become food for sustenance, it must die; otherwise, it cannot become our inner substance. This unchangeable law was ordained by God.</p>
<p>The tree of life in the garden of Eden typifies the life of God (2:9). God&rsquo;s intention in putting Adam in front of the tree of life was for Adam to eat the fruit of the tree of life and receive the life contained in it. God put the man whom He had created in front of the tree of life so that man would receive His eternal life. According to the law mentioned above, if Adam had chosen to eat the fruit of the tree of life, it would have been necessary for the fruit of the tree of life to pass through death in order to become his substance. This means that God had to pass through death so that His life could enter into us to become our life. The revelation contained in the Bible strongly confirms this conclusion. Beginning with Genesis, the Bible reveals that the life of God must pass through death in order to enter into us to become our life. God had to pass through death so that His life could be released and imparted into us.</p>
<p>Life is released through death and transmitted through death. In order for the life of a living creature to enter into another creature, the first must pass through the process of death. This great law concerning life is a deep thought in the Bible. According to this law, in order for the highest life&mdash;the uncreated, eternal life of God&mdash;to enter into created man, God had to pass through the process of death. The Creator had to pass through death in order to release and transmit His life into His creatures. If God had not passed through death, He could not have released His life, and He could not have transmitted His life into us. Death released His life and also transmitted His life into us. Without death there is no release of life, and there is no transmission of life. The release and transmission of life always take place through death.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
