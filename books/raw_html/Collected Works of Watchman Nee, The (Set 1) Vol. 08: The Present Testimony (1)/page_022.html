<H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5</H2><P>My original desire was that one issue of The Present Testimony would be published each month. But we have only been able to publish this one issue after three months. Since I finished The Spiritual Man, my whole being has been exhausted, physically and mentally, and I have had no choice but to rest for a while. I have really stretched myself even to get this issue finished. To those brothers who wrote to me, I need your special patience, for I do not have time to answer each one of you.</P><P>The Lord's work is still going on; we are encouraged by many things, but at the same time we are also grieved by many other things. Nevertheless, God is the Lord of all.</P><P>Because our burden is very heavy today, I beg my brothers and sisters to pray for me and all my co-workers. Do not think that I do not need anyone to pray for me; actually, my need for your prayers is great.</P><P>One thing which has comforted me very much is that we are one in spirit and that no geographical difference can separate us. Our life of oneness in the Lord is so strong that nothing in this universe can separate us. If the Head and the Body are not separated by the distance between heaven and earth, is it not the same for the members of the Body?</P><P>The Editor<br>August 1928</P>
