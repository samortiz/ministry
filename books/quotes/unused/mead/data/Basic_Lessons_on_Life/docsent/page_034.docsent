   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the previous lessons, a foundation concerning life has been laid.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we can get into the experiences of life, and the first experience of life is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. THE DEFINITION OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we need to see the definition of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be regenerated is to be born of God that we may have the divine life, a life other than our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to impress all the saints with this clear definition of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This definition has not been made clear to most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was young, I read a book on the real definition of regener-ation, but the definition it presented was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This book said that regeneration is the new beginning we have when we repent and all our sins are forgiven and considered as something in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regeneration, however, is not merely a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This thought somewhat matches the teaching of Confucius, who said that whenever you repent, you can consider that everything is new from that day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One day I read a book by Brother T. Austin-Sparks which said that to be born again is to receive another life, the eternal and uncreated life of God, in addition to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He gave a brief yet very clear definition of regeneration which deeply impressed me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may take this definition for granted, yet we have to realize that such a definition is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is difficult to find such a word in any other Christian writings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to be impressed that through regeneration, we receive the divine life in addition to our natural, human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regeneration is to have another birth, to be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is clearly revealed in John 1:13 which says that those who receive Christ are "begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whoever is regenerated is born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regeneration is not a matter of considering that all things in the past are dead and that everything is new today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regeneration is not a consideration but a real birth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regeneration is to be born of God in order that we may have the divine life in addition to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I feel strongly that we need to impress the brothers and sisters that to be born again means to be born of God that we may have a second life, a life in addition to our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our natural life is a created life and a temporary life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not an eternal life and an uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In regeneration, we receive another life which is the eternal life, the uncreated life, the divine life, that is, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must point this out clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some Christian teachers would say that to be born again is just to have a new beginning, a new day in your human life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not the truth of regeneration revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regeneration is a matter of birth, a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not a birth of the natural life, of the human life; it is the birth of the divine life, of the eternal life, the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be born again is to experience an extra birth of the life of God, the eternal, uncreated, divine life.</S>
