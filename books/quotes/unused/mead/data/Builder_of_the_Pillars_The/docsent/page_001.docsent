   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILDER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE PILLARS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most striking feature of the exterior of the temple built by Solomon was the two pillars 1 Kings 7:15-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Much of what is found in the Old Testament, such as the tabernacle and the temple, is a shadow, a type.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to know the fulfillment of all these types.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whereas the pillars in 1 Kings 7 refer to the building of the temple of God in the Old Testament, the pillars in Galatians 2:9 refer to the building of God s house in the New Testament, and the pillar in Revelation 3:12 refers to the New Jerusalem in the coming kingdom and in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The building of God s house is altogether dependent on the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Young people, my burden is that you realize that your responsibility is tremendous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today we all have the golden opportunity to be perfected and to be made pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe that after a few years many of you will become pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The pillars of the temple in the Old Testament were built by Solomon through Hiram, a bronze worker who was full of wisdom and understanding and skill to do all kinds of work in bronze 1 Kings 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Solomon was a type of Christ, and Hiram was a type of the gifted person in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That the pillars were not built by Solomon directly but by Solomon through Hiram indicates that today Christ does not build up the pillars directly but through the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here we shall consider Hiram, the builder of the pillars 1 Kings 7:13-15; 2 Chron 2:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles the Bible has much to say about Hiram.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although David and Solomon both prepared skillful men for the building of the temple, Hiram is the only one of these skillful builders mentioned by name.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible not only mentions Hiram s name, but also gives his background in a detailed and meaningful way, telling us of his mother and father and of Hiram himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we study the Bible, we must realize that it has no wasted words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything it stresses or repeats is meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of considering some verse as mere repetition, we must find the significance in each repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I spent much time studying the two pillars in 1 Kings 7 nearly fifty years ago, I did not see any light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I only saw that the names of the two pillars were Jachin, meaning, He shall establish, and Boaz, meaning, In it is strength.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But as we have been considering Jacob s dream and his experience at Bethel, I began to study these two pillars again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This time a great deal of light, like the fourth-day light Gen 1:14-19 , shined upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In my study of the pillars I found that many verses mention Hiram, the builder of the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I knew by the speaking of the Spirit within that I had to pay attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While I was considering the pillars, light also came concerning Hiram s mother and father, neither of whom is named in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was especially bothered by the fact that, according to the Hebrew text, 1 Kings 7:14 says that Hiram was of the tribe of Naphtali.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As I considered all these things further, I realized that I needed one complete message to discharge my burden on the builder of the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you hear about the builder of the pillars, you may say, I don t think that I could ever be a builder.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as God s mercy and grace would make me a pillar, I would be more than satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But do not be so limited.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s grace is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It can not only make you a pillar, but even a builder of pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although I am not saying that all of us will be pillars or builders of pillars, I believe that in the coming years many, even some sisters, will become pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you do not believe this word now, I would ask you to wait for several years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then you will see many pillars raised up in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When that time comes, I will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, I believe that a good number of us will also become Hirams, the builders of pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God needs these Hirams.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only one temple was built in Solomon s time, but today many local churches need to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How many Hirams will be required for this work!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every local church needs at least one Hiram.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever there is a Hiram in a local church, that church is in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank the Lord that He has raised up a number of Hirams in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But I believe that in the future the Lord will perfect many more Hirams.</S>
