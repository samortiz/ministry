 <h2 class="head1">IV. THE SECRET<br />
OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<p>1. ENJOYING THE BOUNTIFUL SPIRIT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</strong>  Philippians 1:19</p>
<p>In the previous lesson we saw that after Christ passed through the process of glorification, He became the compound, life-giving Spirit. With all His rich and bountiful elements He is like an all-inclusive drink which is sufficient to meet all our needs.</p>
<p>If we drink of the Spirit by <strong>calling on His name</strong> and <strong>pray-reading His Word</strong> often, we will receive a continual supply to experience Christ.</p>
<p>2. RECEIVING THE RICH WORD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo;</strong>  Colossians 3:16</p>
<p>The bountiful supply of the Spirit is embodied in God&rsquo;s rich word. If we daily <strong>pray His word and sing His word,</strong> and let His word dwell in us richly, we will be nourished and strengthened to experience Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE RESULT<br />
OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<p>What fills a man inwardly will be spontaneously manifested outwardly. If we continually experience Christ and receive Him as our life and everything, we will become the expression of Christ.</p>
<p>1. LIVING CHRIST</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For to me to live is Christ.&rdquo;</strong> Philippians 1:21</p>
<p>The normal experience of Christ is to live Him. To live Christ means that we take Him as life in any kind of circumstance so that our living is just Christ lived out. In this way Christ will:</p>
<h2 class="head2">(1) Be revealed in us</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me.&rdquo;</strong>  Galatians 1:15-16</p>
<h2 class="head2">(2) Live in us</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&rdquo;</strong>  Galatians 2:20</p>
<h2 class="head2">(3) Make home in us</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 3:17</p>
<h2 class="head2">(4) Be formed in us</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you.&rdquo;</strong> Galatians 4:19</p>
<p>2. EXPRESSED THROUGH THE CHURCH</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 1:22b-23</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ and also the fullness of Christ. This fullness comes out of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s riches are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8). When we <strong>experience Christ</strong> and <strong>enjoy His riches</strong> continually, we will <strong>become His fullness.</strong></p>
