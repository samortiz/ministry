   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By referring to the drawing of the gate, you can see that within the gate is the entry of the gate, which is exactly ten cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is meaningful that the opening of the entrance is ten cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The number ten in the Bible first of all refers to the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever the Ten Commandments require, the entry of the gate fulfills.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The width or the breadth of the entry is exactly the span of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus fulfilled all the requirements of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are faced with the Ten Commandments, we are excluded, but the Lord Jesus was able to fulfill every commandment and become the gate for us to enter into God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While the entry or the opening is ten cubits wide, the gate is thirteen cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The gate is three cubits wider than the opening.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On both sides of the gate, the wall measures one and a half cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By adding the two together, we have three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Three is the number of the Triune God and also the number of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the three is divided one and one-half is on one side, and one and one-half is on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please remember that in the tabernacle in the wilderness, the standing boards were one and one-half cubits wide and that two of them formed one unit of three cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these numbers mean that the Lord Jesus, who fills all the requirements of the Ten Commandments, is the Triune God who became a man, was split put to death , and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By His death He was figuratively cut into two halves, and then He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the gate comes the threshold, which measures six cubits by ten cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By putting these numbers together we can realize that Christ is the Triune God who became a man having the number six.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was split in His death and was resurrected, fulfilling all the requirements of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By this process He opened the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may say this is simply an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It may be, but what kind of interpretation do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I see the letters b-o-y, my interpretation is "boy."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is your interpretation?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It must be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Three is the number of the Triune God and of resurrection, six is the number of man, and ten signifies the Ten Commandments in two groups of five.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the threshold we go to the passage.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The passage has many details.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ezekiel 40:10 says that in this passage are six little chambers or guardrooms.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some of the better translations say "guardrooms."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These are the rooms where the guards stay who protect the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The guardrooms are six cubits long and six cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Again, we have a square of six cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The size of the guardroom is exactly the size of the cross section of the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This means that the Lord Jesus in His Person and work is the real guard of God's glory and God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there were no wall, all the sinful people would be able to enter into the temple and become an insult to God's glory and God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The wall separates the sinners from God, but the gates bring people in. In order for the Lord Jesus to be the gate to bring people in, He had to fulfill all the requirements of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was a square, upright, proper man, able to fulfill the Ten Commandments, and now He Himself becomes the guardrooms of God's glory and God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only those who are fully qualified and match God's glory and God's holiness can enter the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Who can be fully qualified?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only those who have passed through the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By passing through the gate, our Lord Jesus, we are qualified to enter into God's building which is full of God's glory and God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The six guardrooms are divided into two groups of three.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Again, we have the number three signifying the Triune God who became a man and was split into two.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the guardrooms.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The guardrooms are a person, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus was the Triune God incarnated to be a man, crucified, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Between the three guardrooms are two spaces of five cubits each.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Again we have ten cubits composed of two groups of five cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This shows us once more that Christ bears the responsibility to fulfill all the requirements of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, it is on two sides, signifying a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Two indicate a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On one side there are two spaces of five cubits each, and on the other side there are also two spaces of five cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This indicates to us that Christ bears the responsibility of the Ten Commandments fully, and that this becomes a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus as the Triune God became a man and died on the cross, fulfilling all the responsibilities of the Ten Commandments.</S>
