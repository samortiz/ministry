<P>Verses 17-19:"And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately, and on the way He said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. And they will condemn Him to death, and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised." This is the third time the Lord foretold His own death. This shows that His death was not a martyr's death. Martyrdom occurs as an incidental matter, but the Lord knew how and when He was to die. There are two parts to the Lord's word: (1) The chief priests and the scribes were the religious part. The Lord was judged and condemned first by the Jews. (2) The Gentiles were the political part. Later He was executed by the Gentiles. These were all eventually fulfilled. First He was condemned by the Jews, and next He was delivered to Pilate. In the council the Jews accused Him of blasphemy. Before Pilate they accused Him of rebellion. The Jews were the directors and the instigators, and the Gentiles were the executors and the administrators.</P><P>Verse 20:"Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him." The mother of the sons of Zebedee had only heard of such things as the reward and the throne. After hearing of these things, her heart was very much drawn. But she had also heard of the cross and the difficult requirement of self-denial. So she came to the Lord herself to discuss this matter. Her thought was that for her two sons to merely sit on one of the twelve thrones was not sufficient; they had to be the thrones of the greatest honor. The same thought is present among Christians today who think that they must be the greatest Christians. To them, merely to preach is not sufficient; they must lead revival meetings. She thought that since the Lord had once borrowed a boat, a net, and food from her, she could now ask something from the Lord and would not be rejected.</P><P>Verse 21:"And He said to her, What do you want? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom." The Lord asked, "What do you want?" After petitioning the Lord she still could not make the Lord understand what she wanted. She wanted one son to sit on His right hand and the other to sit on His left hand. She thought that if her sons received glory, she herself also would be honored. This is to bring the natural man into the kingdom. She thought that things in the kingdom of the heavens are the same as they are in the flesh.</P><P>Verses 22-23:"But Jesus answered and said to them, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink? They said to Him, We are able. He said to them, My cup you shall indeed drink, but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father." She thought that she knew what she was asking, but the Lord said, "You do not know what you are asking." They all said with one voice that they were able. They did not realize what they were saying. While the Lord was suffering, Peter escaped. To drink the cup means to submit to the Father's will. The baptism refers to the death of the cross (here there is no mention of baptism). The cup was in the garden of Gethsemane, while the baptism was on the cross (Luke 12:50). The cup signifies sacrifice and submission to God; baptism signifies death. The Gospel of Mark presents the Lord as the Servant; thus, it mentions baptism (an act of being put to death). The Gospel of Matthew presents the Lord as the King; hence, there is no mention of baptism, but only of the cup, which signifies the heart of submission. The position in the kingdom is not gained through relatives or prayer. "This is not Mine to give." This means that it cannot be given based on the Lord's likes and dislikes. The position in the kingdom is not gained at will; it is preassigned and is given to those who fulfill the requirements. Hence, any man who thinks that the saved ones can receive the kingdom is a son of Zebedee.</P><P>Verse 25:"But Jesus called them to Him and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them." Verse 24 mentions ten disciples. The disciples were divided into two parties, one group of two and one group of ten. The ten thought that the two were too fleshly, unspiritual, proud, and discontent, not satisfied with what the Lord had given them, and were too selfish, caring only for themselves and not for their fellow disciples. Thus, the ten thought that they were indignant for righteousness's sake. Actually, they themselves also had selfish motives and pride; otherwise, they would not have quarreled. The two parties were the same, differing only in their words and intention. The ten disciples were sorry only that they did not have such a mother to speak up for them. "Jesus called them to Him." The Lord knew them; hence, He called them and spoke concerning three matters: (1) The church cannot be like the Gentiles, having rulers and great ones, because "you are all brothers" (Matt. 23:8). Therefore, to have the pope, the bishop, the pastor, and the priests is unscriptural and is against the Lord's command. Even if the title is not used and yet the fact exists, it is still not permitted. To rule and instruct others spiritually is permitted, but to rule over others positionally is absolutely forbidden. In the Bible the overseers, the shepherds, the elders, the teachers, etc. are all spiritual. Today in the church a very fleshy pastor can rule over a most spiritual carpenter. Men desire to be an elder or a deacon only because they want to increase their own power in the church. We ought to serve the Lord faithfully and strive to please Him. However, if a person tries to gain a higher position over others in the kingdom through his service, it is a sin.</P><P>Verses 26-27:"It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave." (2) A servant is one who is sent yet still has freedom. (3) "Slave" is a stronger word. "To be first" is to be the best within a group of people. Hence, those who want to be great must be a servant (less severe), while those who want to be the first must be a slave (more severe). The position in the kingdom is exactly opposite to today's situation. We want to be great and to be the first in this age, but the Lord wants us to receive the reward in the coming age. Man wants a reward but is unwilling to pay the price. To be great spiritually is to be humble and to suffer spiritually. We are able to be humble before God, yet it seems that we are unable to be humble before man.</P><P>Verse 28:"Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many." "The Son of Man" came. He descended from the highest position to the lowest position. He humbled Himself and took upon Himself the form of a slave, specifically to serve man; and not only did He serve man, but He became the Savior of man. (Today's YMCA probably has forgotten this verse in the Bible.)</P><P>Verse 29:"And as they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him." Jericho was a cursed place, but when the Lord came, it began to receive blessings.</P><P>Verse 30:"And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!" "Two blind men." The other Gospels mention only one. Actually, there were two. Matthew particularly recorded this because Matthew is a testimony of the Lord being David's descendant (One who is the King). Two is the number of testimony.</P><P>The two blind men's testimony attested to God's will: although the Lord was rejected, He still was the King. This incidence in Jericho was the prelude to His entrance into Jerusalem in chapter twenty-one (as the book of Jude is the prelude to Revelation).</P><P>Verse 31:"And the crowd rebuked them so that they would be silent, but they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!" God's intention was to make them speak louder. To rebuke means to forbid; the crowd forbade them from testifying, yet God caused them to cry out even louder.</P><P>Verse 32:"And Jesus, standing still, called them and said, What do you want Me to do for you?" The Lord did not know the purpose of their prayer. That is why our prayers need to have a purpose. The reason our prayers uttered in times of crisis often receive an answer is that we ask with a purpose.</P><P>Verse 33:"They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened." Here the purpose of the prayer was given.</P><P>Verse 34:"And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed Him." Many people, after their eyes are healed, immediately go sightseeing. After men receive blessings, they seek pleasure. However, these two men followed Him.</P>
