Lord, we come to drink of You again. May You satisfy us more and more. Open Your word to us, Lord, and wash and renew us with the water in Your word. May You, as the cleft rock, flow forth the living water again to us that we all may be refreshed, satisfied, and rejoicing in our heart. We desire to praise You aloud and bear Your testimony forever. Amen.<h2 class=head1>THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE BEING CHRIST</h2><p>In order for us to love a certain thing, that thing must be lovable. Actually, we love something not because we are capable of loving; rather, it is because a certain thing is lovable and we are drawn to love it. We are very reluctant to love something that is not lovable, but it is difficult for us to refrain from loving something that is lovable. Likewise, we love the Lord because we are attracted by His loveliness. He is very attractive. In the past two thousand years, innumerable people have been attracted and charmed by Him, and we are among them. Sometimes our relatives and friends rebuke us, saying, &#8220;Why do you believe in Jesus so blindly?&#8221; We do not know why and we cannot explain it, but we are simply charmed by the Lord Jesus because He is truly full of attractiveness.<p>This Christ who is full of attractiveness and rich in magnetism is the essence of the Bible. The Bible covers thousands of items and deals with a great number of doctrines, but it has only one center-Christ Himself. Let us use the human body as an illustration. We can see skin and hair on the surface, touch the flesh and bones within, and examine the internal organs through dissection or by an x-ray. However, the center, the essence, of man, which is man&#8217;s life, is neither visible nor touchable, yet it is real and crucial. Likewise, the Bible has its &#8220;skeleton&#8221; and &#8220;skin.&#8221; If we touch or see only these things in our reading of the Bible, we are not different from the unbelievers in their reading of the Bible. We must realize that the Bible also has its life, its essence. The life, the essence, of the Bible is Jesus Christ.<p>The Bible consists of two sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament speaks of Christ with a great part in types and a considerable part in prophecies but nearly with no plain words. This may be compared to the teaching material in kindergartens that consists of very few plain words but many pictures. The teaching material in graduate schools, however, contains very few pictures; instead, it contains many classical writings. Although the Old Testament, like the teaching material in kindergartens, consists mostly of pictures with very few plain words, it is not simple to understand the meaning of the pictures. Therefore, concerning the types in the Old Testament, we need to understand their significance.<h2 class=head1>THE TYPES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p>There are six major categories of types in the Old Testament. The first category is human beings; the second, animals; the third, plants; the fourth, minerals; the fifth, offerings; and the sixth, foods. All these six major categories contain types of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Human Beings</h2><p>Some examples from the category of human beings are Adam, typifying Christ as the head of the human race; Isaac, typifying Christ as the seed of Abraham; and Solomon, the son of David, typifying Christ as the seed of David. Christ is not only the head of the human race but also the seed of man and the seed of woman. He is the King, the Priest, and the Prophet. As the King, He is typified by Judah and David; as the Priest, He is typified by Melchisedec and Aaron; and as the Prophet, He is typified by Isaiah and Jonah. Hence, to understand all the portrayals of Christ in the aspect of human beings, we have to study Adam, Abraham, David, Solomon, Melchisedec, Aaron, Isaiah, Jonah, and others.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Four Crucial Elements of the Bible, The-Christ, the Spirit, Life, and the Church &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
