        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE SPEAKING<br />
IN OUR DAILY LIFE,<br />
MINISTRY, AND MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:8; 8:4-5; Eph. 5:18-22; 2 Tim. 4:1-5; Acts 5:42; 1 Cor. 12:2-3, 9; 14:1, 4, 26, 31</h1>
<p>We have seen in the previous chapter that God&rsquo;s desire has always been that all His people, in both the Old and New Testaments would be a speaking people. In this chapter we will cover a number of verses concerning the divine speaking in our daily life, in the ministry, and in our meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WITNESSES OF THE LIVING CHRIST</h2>
<p>In Acts 1:8, the Lord Jesus told the disciples, &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo; In this verse the crucial point is, &ldquo;You shall be My witnesses.&rdquo; Witnesses are speakers. We have to realize that as believers we all have been made the witnesses of the living Christ. When the Lord Jesus spoke this, He was speaking in resurrection. He was not only the incarnated Christ who lived on this earth in His flesh, but He was the Christ who passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and who entered into resurrection. Not many days after this word was spoken, the Lord Jesus ascended into heaven. Ten days after His ascension, He poured Himself out as the Spirit of power economically upon His disciples. Then they received the power and were made His witnesses to speak concerning Him. What would they speak? Surely they would speak that this Christ is God, and that this Christ as God was incarnated. Perhaps Peter would say, &ldquo;I saw Him. When He was a man living on this earth, I accompanied Him all the way from Galilee to Samaria, to Judea, and to Jerusalem. I ate with Him, and I stayed with Him. I lived with Him for three and a half years. I was with Him!&rdquo; They would continue to tell people, &ldquo;We saw how He was crucified on the cross, how His blood was shed, and how He was buried. Then on the third day, early in the morning, we went to His tomb and saw that the tomb was empty! The angels there told us that He had resurrected from the tomb! We saw this! Then in the evening He came to us. He showed us His physical body in resurrection with the nail prints. After that He stayed with us, appearing and disappearing for forty days. He charged us to wait until we received power from on high, and we got it! On the mount of Olives we saw Him ascend into the heavens. There the angels told us that He would come back.&rdquo; No doubt, those disciples were speaking Christ in this way. They were witnessing the living One. They were not speaking doctrine. They were not speaking law. They were not speaking prophecy. They were not speaking types, or proverbs, or psalms. They were speaking Christ, a living Person! Their speaking was concerning His being God, His incarnation, His living on this earth, His being crucified, His resurrection, His staying with them in those forty days, and His ascension to heaven. Surely they spoke all these aspects concerning Christ. They spoke nothing but Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ in every aspect.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost Peter delivered the first message of the New Testament. This message is recorded in Acts 2. Peter spoke just Christ, telling the Jews, &ldquo;The very Jesus whom you crucified is the One God raised up! You put Him to death, but God came in to raise Him up, even to uplift Him to the heavens!&rdquo; Just by that one speaking, three thousand believed and were baptized. Then they began to meet, not only in the temple, but also from home to home. In their homes they preached and they taught. They preached Jesus and they taught Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING CHRIST WITH THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>In our home meetings we also need to preach and teach Jesus. We all have to speak! But many of us would not know what to speak. For this reason I would like to present to you the materials for your speaking. In our hymnal we have 1,080 hymns. We collected all the best hymns from the Christian writings. From more than ten thousand hymns we only selected about eight hundred. After the selection, I did my best to classify them into a table of contents for the hymnal. I would ask the young people to study it. This table occupies four and a half pages with thirty categories of hymns. In these thirty categories there are more than four hundred items. Within the category of Experience of Christ there are thirty-two items. These items are the riches of Christ. In the category of meetings we were only able to collect hymns in three sections. Due to the shortage of hymns in this category I did my best to write the few hymns comprising the sections of Christ as the Center, Exhibiting Christ, Exercising the Spirit, and Functioning. <em>Hymns,</em> #863 is on Christ as the center of the meetings:</p>
<p class="hbody">In daily walk and in our meetings too,<br />
Christ is the center, Christ is everything;<br />
&rsquo;Tis not for form nor doctrine good and true,<br />
But &rsquo;tis for Christ alone we&rsquo;re gathering.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the way and Christ the light of life,<br />
In Him we walk and by Him we are led;<br />
Christ is the living water and the food;<br />
Of Him we drink and we with Him are fed.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the truth, &rsquo;tis Him we testify,<br />
Christ is the life, &rsquo;tis Him we minister;<br />
Christ is the Lord, &rsquo;tis Him we magnify,<br />
Christ is the Head, and we exalt Him here.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the All in all to God and man&mdash;<br />
With Him both we and God are satisfied;<br />
Christ, the reality within the Church&mdash;<br />
By Him are life and numbers multiplied.</p>
<p class="hbody">By all the hymns and prayers we offer here,<br />
Christ the reality we would express;<br />
All the activities in fellowship&mdash;<br />
Christ thus in operation manifest.</p>
<p class="hbody">&rsquo;Tis in His Name we meet, in Spirit act,<br />
With nothing in our mind to formalize;<br />
&rsquo;Tis by His pow&rsquo;r we pray, in unction praise,<br />
And with Himself in spirit exercise.</p>
<p class="hbody">All things forgetting, cleaving unto Christ,<br />
Applying Him until maturity;<br />
Let us count everything but loss for Him,<br />
For Him, our All in all, eternally!</p>
<p>With just this one hymn in your hand, you have a lot to speak! This hymn is a key to open up the mine for you to dig out all the rich items. Do not say you have nothing to speak in the meetings. You have a lot to speak. Just open to this one hymn. The young saints should not wait to let the older ones preside over, to pastor, the home meetings. We all have a lot to speak concerning Christ. Just turn to <em>Hymns,</em> #863 and begin to read and speak, &ldquo;&lsquo;In daily walk and in our meetings too, Christ is the center.&rsquo; Saints, do you know that Christ is the center of our daily walk, and the center of our meeting tonight?&rdquo; Then the meeting will be very much enriched. We do not need to merely sing the hymn, but even more we need to read and speak it. Ephesians 5:18-19 says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.&rdquo; According to our natural, religious concept, songs and hymns are only good for singing. In Christianity I never heard songs, hymns, and psalms spoken in the meetings. But in the New Testament, we are told that the way to be filled in our spirit is by speaking psalms, hymns, and songs. Psalms are the longest pieces, hymns are shorter, and songs are the shortest ones. All these are firstly for speaking, then for singing.</p>
<p>We have to learn to speak the riches of Christ in hymns such as <em>Hymns,</em> #864, which begins:</p>
<p class="hbody">Whene&rsquo;er we meet with Christ endued,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surplus of His plenitude<br />
We offer unto God as food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus exhibit Christ.</p>
<p>By what way do we offer Christ to God? We offer Him to God by our speaking to God. This is prayer. However, many times when we pray, it seems that in our prayer we are teaching God. That is absolutely wrong. The most precious prayer is to present Christ to God. Speak Him to God; this is the best prayer.</p>
<p>The hymn continues, &ldquo;Let us exhibit Christ.&rdquo; To meet is to just have an exhibition of Christ. We exhibit Christ by speaking one to another in hymns, psalms, and songs. The content of our speaking must be the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ with all His attributes. He is the subject. He is the center. He is God&rsquo;s centrality and universality. He is the reality of our living. We just have to speak Him in many, many items. We present Him to God by speaking Him to God. We exhibit Him to the meeting ones by speaking Him to the meeting ones, by speaking to one another. We have a lot of riches of Christ to speak. We need to learn to speak Christ to God and to speak Christ to one another.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 5:18-19 Paul says, &ldquo;And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo; We are to be filled with the Triune God as the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit in our spirit. This filling occurs, not by our speaking in the common, worldly language, but by speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. In our hymnal there are many good hymns full of the truth. Every hymn, especially those written by us, is a good message full of the riches of Christ. For example, <em>Hymns,</em> #501 describes how Christ was the infinite God in eternity, who as God&rsquo;s radiant expression became a finite man, limited in time. As the very expression of God, He died for us to accomplish redemption in His flesh. Then He became a life-giving Spirit to be one with us. We must learn to speak Christ with the hymns. I believe these hymnals are good for having our home meetings. In every meeting we should use a hymn in a living way.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
