   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 9 THE TEMPLE 1 The Temple</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The temple and the tabernacle reveal two aspects of the church, each appearing in two different periods of Israel s history.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the time of Israel s sojourning in the wilderness, there was the tabernacle; after Israel settled down in Canaan, there was the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In its move, it was the tabernacle, and in its residence, it was the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Just as the tabernacle is a type of the church, the temple is also a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everything related to the tabernacle, which typifies the church, is included in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, there are a few items of the church that are not spoken of in relation to the type of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These items require the supplement of the temple; likewise, some items of the church require the supplement of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the aspects of the tabernacle and the temple are considered together, the church can be completely and clearly explained.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are four related aspects to the types of the tabernacle and temple.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus says, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time the Jews did not understand what this word meant, but later the disciples understood that the Lord was referring to His body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus was the temple of God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Jews used the hands of the Gentiles to destroy the body of the Lord Jesus, but after three days He was raised from the dead vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This clearly shows that the Lord Jesus is the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just as the tabernacle was God s dwelling place on earth, the temple also was God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the individual saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Corinthians 6:19 says that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, a temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the tabernacle there were three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The temple was also composed of these three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both types reveal that we as individuals are composed of three parts: body, soul, and spirit 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fourth, both the tabernacle and the temple typify the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the new heavens and the new earth, the temple will be enlarged into a city, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There will be no temple in the New Jerusalem because the temple will be enlarged into a city Rev 21:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today God s dwelling can be likened to a house, but in eternity God s dwelling will be a city.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The house will be enlarged into a city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In considering the temple as a type of the church, we need to pay special attention to the builders, the material, and the way the temple was built.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Builders David</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Two persons built the temple: David and Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Both David and Solomon typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>David typifies Christ in His sufferings, and Solomon typifies Christ in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The temple was built by these two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a strict sense, Solomon built the temple, but David cannot be excluded because he had much to do with its building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Desire</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>David s desire was to find a dwelling place for God and to build a resting place for God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This desire typifies Christ s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Second Samuel 7 and Psalm 132 both record that David swore to find a resting place for God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>David had a strong desire and made an oath because the Ark of God did not have a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Ark was God s representative on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fact that the Ark did not have a dwelling place indicated that God did not have a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When Christ came to the earth, He desired to find a dwelling place for God and to build a resting place for God, that is, to establish the church as God s resting place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the church is God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without the church, God does not have a dwelling place or a resting place on the earth.</S>
