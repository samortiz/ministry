   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Walking by This Rule</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 6:16 Paul goes on to say, And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The rule Paul speaks of here is that of being a new creation, living by the Spirit through faith, not that of keeping the law through the observance of ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This rule, the rule of the new creation, is the processed Triune God being our life and our living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, we say that in the church life we do not have regulations and rules.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although this is true, it is not true in every sense, for we do have the rule mentioned in 6:16.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to walk by the rule which is the Triune God processed to be our life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To live in this way by the new creation is our rule.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 5:25 Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit, and in 6:16 he charges us to walk by this rule.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that to walk by this rule is to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, the rule is equal to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we live by the Spirit, we live by the processed Triune God as our life and our living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, to live by the Spirit is to live by this rule.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peace and Mercy</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul says concerning those who walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul opens his Epistles with a word about grace and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is true of Galatians 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But at the end of Galatians, Paul mentions peace v. 16 before grace v. 18 . Grace is the Triune God becoming our enjoyment, and peace is the issue, the result, of this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whenever we enjoy the Triune God as grace, we have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Peace is thus the condition that results from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, even though we have peace, we still have need for more grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First we receive grace, and grace brings in the condition of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then as we abide in this peaceful condition, we need to receive further grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition to grace, we also need mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, Paul says that upon those who walk by this rule, who walk by the Spirit, there should be peace and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Israel of God</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul concludes verse 16 with the words, even upon the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greek word rendered even kai here is not connective but explicative, indicating that the apostle considers the many individual believers in Christ collectively the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Israel of God is the real Israel Rom 9:6; 2:28-29; Phil 3:3 , including all the Gentile and Jewish believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are the true sons of Abraham Gal 3:7, 29 , the household of the faith 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who walk by this rule are the true Israel, the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a way there is no difference between the nation of Israel and the secular world or the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the eyes of God, the nation of Israel is not the real Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We, the sons of God, are the true Israel, for we are God s household, His chosen people today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may not be Israel outwardly, but we are Israel inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is why we say that we, the believers in Christ, are the true Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The outward nation of Israel has little concern for God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we have a genuine concern for God and speak of Him continually.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are indeed the Israel of God.</S>
