   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE TWO TRADITIONAL SIGNS IN JOHN FOUR: JACOB'S WELL AND MOUNT GERIZIM 2 Scripture Reading: John 4:3-34, 39-42</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the foregoing message we began to consider the two traditional signs in John 4: Jacob's well and Mount Gerizim.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We focused our attention on the sign of Jacob's well and saw that this well signifies that nothing traditional can satisfy the thirst in human life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our thirst can be quenched only by the living Person of Christ, the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall consider the second sign, the sign of Mount Gerizim.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE HISTORY RELATED TO MOUNT GERIZIM</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mount Gerizim is also a traditional sign.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through a history involving three major steps this mountain became something traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, as we have already mentioned, the land where Mount Gerizim was located was a treasure belonging to Jacob Gen 33:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jacob then gave this land as a particular inheritance to his beloved son, Joseph Josh 24:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, when the children of Israel were about to enter the good land, they were charged by God through Moses to declare God's blessing to those who keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This declaration was to be made on Mount Gerizim.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Deuteronomy 11:29 speaks concerning this: "And it shall come to pass, when the Lord thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou gone to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Deuteronomy 27:12, six tribes were to stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that Mount Gerizim was the most important mountain in the territory given to Joseph by Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Mount Gerizim did not equal Mount Sinai in importance, it is nevertheless a fact that the blessing related to keeping the law was declared on Mount Gerizim.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That declaration concerning the keeping of the law made Mount Gerizim unique in importance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Third, during the time of the kings, the Assyrians captured this territory, located in the northern Kingdom of Israel, and brought people from Babylon and other heathen places to that region and caused them to settle there 2 Kings 17:6, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result, pagan worship was brought in and was mixed with the worship of the true God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Josephus, a famous Jewish historian, Alexander the Great gave permission, approximately three hundred thirty years before Christ, to a man named Manasseh, a brother of the high priest, to build a temple on Mount Gerizim.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that a Jew built a temple for the worship of God on the top of Mount Gerizim.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That served to strengthen the concept held by the Samaritans that Mount Gerizim was the proper place for the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the background for what the Samaritan woman said to the Lord Jesus, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" John 4:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Jews had ground from the Scriptures to insist that the right place for the worship of God was Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Samaritans, however, did not have the ground to claim that Mount Gerizim was the proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When a temple was built on Mount Gerizim by Manasseh, the mixture in worship was not only strengthened but also completed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>More than two centuries later, in 126 B.C., that temple for this mixed worship was destroyed by another Jew named John Hyrcanus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a sketch of the history related to Mount Gerizim.</S>
