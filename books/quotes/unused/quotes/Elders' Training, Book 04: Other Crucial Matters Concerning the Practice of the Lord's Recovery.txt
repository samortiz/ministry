As the Lord's recovery is continually spreading throughout the world, these messages are more than crucial and urgently needed
Our hope and expectation is that these messages will become a governing and controlling vision for all in the Lord's recovery
The papal system stopped the councils and the creeds because from that time onward whatever the pope said was the final word
Nearly no other field in human culture has so many thousands of different publications as in the field of Christianity
The Brethren are very much for Calvin in the matter of predestination, but they would not go along completely with reformed theology
Even some theological schools are not so pure for theology itself, but are more in the realm of studying the Bible as a type of literature
A few years ago at a certain conference, a number of Christians held up a banner which said, 'We don't follow Paul, we follow Christ'
We unintentionally bring the Lord's recovery back to the old books which the Lord's recovery has gone through already
The problem is, though, that the followers of certain faithful brothers received the light, yet they all stopped with what they received
The followers of Luther stopped at the Lutheran faith, and the followers of John Wesley stopped at the Methodist faith
Brother Nee considered that in that time as far as the Lord's recovery was concerned China was a piece of 'virgin soil'
Whenever we write something for publication, we would not need to spend much time going to the books themselves
In the past sixty years, by His mercy, we have picked up all the basic items of the divine and spiritual matters
After you have received a good foundation in the basic truths of the divine revelation, you will be fully established
Some of you who graduated from a seminary can testify that you did not receive anything advanced or improved there
They say it is the influence of Christianity, the influence of the biblical truth, or the entrance of the gospel
We have put all these things, not in a scholarly form, but in a 'layman's form' which is John's form in the book of John
We have a pure system of publications which comprise all the main things of the divine, spiritual, and heavenly things
These publications are very adequate for all the young saints among us to have a good foundation laid and a strong standing established
They could go on, not to learn more things from the old books, but to check the old books and to get themselves confirmed
You need the context of that verse, then you need the context of the entire book, and finally you need a bird's-eye view of the entire Bible
The ones who declare that the Father in Isaiah 9:6 is the Father of eternity and not the Father in the Godhead may also say the same thing
A child is born, but a son is given, which matches John 3:16 saying that God has given us His only begotten Son
As such a one, His name is called: 'Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, Father of eternity, The prince of Peace'
To them He is also God, even the mighty God, who is able to carry out whatever counsel He makes for them as their Counselor
The Messiah who is the Wonderful Counselor and the mighty God to His people Israel is not eternitys Father but His peoples eternal Father
He is His peoples Wonderful Counselor His peoples mighty God His peoples peaceful Prince and His peoples eternal Father not eternitys Father
Do not go to the old books in a light way and believe whatever you pick up from the old books merely by your present capacity of discernment
In verse 10 the Lord says that the Spirit convicts the world concerning righteousness because He goes to the Father
If we believe in Him, we will be transferred out of Adam under the sinful condition into Christ on a righteous standing
Pilgrim's Progress, which was written by John Bunyan, an Anabaptist, was one of the top selling books next to the Bible
It was even more popular than George Cutting's Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment, which is a booklet concerning the assurance of salvation
We must realize however that the Lords recovery has brought us absolutely back to His New Testament economy and the New Testament ministry
There was nothing wrong with him picking up a burden to bring the gospel, the Lord's name, and the Bible to China
We always considered that this was the top mission to China and was very scriptural, spiritual, and evangelical
After we had seen God's New Testament economy with God's New Testament ministry, however, we could not absolutely say amen to this mission
They used to ask people to write a letter to their denomination asking them to take their name off the membership roll
Hudson Taylor was George Muller's friend in the Lord, and George Muller greatly helped the China Inland Mission financially
On the other hand, we cannot deny that even with this wonderful work there was an element of deviation which still remained
If you came from the Methodists, you could establish the church in the interior of China according to the Methodists
Once a reader gets the help from that book, it might be hard for him to have a clear and accurate view concerning the church
Even if the reader did not swallow the entire book, there would be an unconscious entrance into his being concerning this deviation
Some young saints who read this book might think, 'Could such a great evangelist who was used by God to such an extent be wrong?
One sentence from this book should be quite impressive to all of you-Brother Nee said the church is local and the work is regional
Some would take a standing to say that these were two worksone for the Jews in the Jewish land and one for the Gentiles in the Gentile world
One work was by a group of workers having Peter as the leader, and one work was by a group of workers having Paul as the leader
The Lord has, in the New Testament age, one unique ministry for one move to produce one unique Body as one unique testimony
Based upon this, we can see that the Judaizers, the Judaizing believers, tried to overcome the Gentile believers at Paul's time
The Lord moved to establish His Body in the Gentile world to bear a testimony in the typical, heathen, pagan world
Under that situation, he could not go on with the Lord's ministry to continue the Lord's testimony among the heathen
The concluding word given by James was still under the influence of the Mosaic law, due to his heavy Judaic background
According to the basic principle of the New Testament economy, the decision made in Acts 15 is not so satisfactory to us
You may have never heard such a word or have said such a word, but such a thing is secretly hidden there and has crept in unconsciously
Some may ask whether or not the receiving of a brother is a local administration matter or something related to the Body
By this we can see that the receiving of the saints is not merely a local administration matter because it affects the Body of Christ
If you receive every genuine believer, you are a part of the Body representing the Body and not a sect representing yourselves
A decision to have seven meetings a week or four meetings a week is merely, purely, and singly a local administration matter
Paul's ministry was a general ministry to produce the Gentile churches, to establish them, to edify them, and to help them grow
For the church in Corinth to receive such a ministry, they must consider the effect of receiving such a ministry
We must also realize that for a local church to print and distribute publications affects the testimony of all the churches
They claimed that the church in Los Angeles was just the training center and that it did not have the proper practice of the church life
When they came to attend the training for ten days, however, they tasted the general flavor in the Lord's recovery
When they began to meet, to their surprise about one-half of the saints there immediately came to stand with them
The brother in that locality may have thought that this was absolutely a local matter and that the church there had a local administration
The distance between the churches means nothing, especially due to the fact that we are living in an age of modern means of communication
The word catholic is a good word but it has been spoiled damaged contaminated corrupted and ruined by the socalled Roman Catholic Church
We should not consider that just because we brothers are working in a certain region covering a few states that this is our region
Peter also began the work in Judea, but if he thought that was his region and not Paul's region, that would be wrong
After Peter said something, Paul testified to the dear saints in Jerusalem, telling them what the Lord had been doing through his ministry
Whatever they were doing there was only under one move to carry out one ministry to produce the one Body that bears one unique testimony
In the ancient times, if you lived in a big city, you might not have heard the news of what happened in your city two or three days before
Today however whatever happens all over the earth is made known to us within even less than a few hours by telephone television and radio
On this earth people can see such a testimony among people of all nationalities and races over the entire globe
Wherever you go, these people speak the same thing, minister the same thing, do the same thing, and bear the same testimony
Many of us can testify that when we touch things other than this testimony, the anointing is not with us that much
He has been seeking such a testimony for two thousand years, and this is the real revelation that the New Testament bears and conveys to us
What a mercy that we could be in such a testimony around this globe with different races and with all nationalities
In Singapore, Hong Kong, Manila, Taipei, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Dallas, Cleveland, and New York we saw the same thing
In the United States which is the top country of the socalled Christianity strictly speaking there has never been such a testimony of Jesus
The Christian testimony today is division, confusions, different kinds of teachings, debates, fightings, and denominations
The Epistle to the Ephesians was not written in a clear way to tell us exactly to which church this book was addressed
Concerning the testimony that the church bears, we must stress the Body, which is the universal aspect of the church
Chapters nine through twelve are on the Body and chapters thirteen through sixteen end with the local churches
The Body can never be divided into localities, but in the sense of the churches, they are in different localities
In Revelation 2 and 3 every local church is different, but in chapter one the seven lampstands are not different in any aspect
Due to certain environments and certain political situations on this earth the Lords move although by one ministry is in different regions
The subject which they were talking about is over because a 'foreigner' from a 'foreign region' has come to join them
In Revelation 1 there are seven different localities-Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea
When the seven lampstands are put together, it is impossible to distinguish between them unless you number them
In Revelation 1 the standard is that all of the churches must be the same in God's nature, in Christ's shape, and in the Spirit's expression
In the gold, in the shape, and in the seven lamps, all the churches should be exactly the same, yet actually they are not
The churches picked up many things from their localities which became differences that the Lord needed to judge and deal with
Though, if our practice is this way, a lot of Jezebels will be brought in instead of being destroyed by the Lord
Some expositions, however, take these differences in a positive sense to encourage the local churches to be different from one another
We all have been tested, though, as to how pure our love is for Him and how pure our heart is for His recovery
Everybody sees this, but could we say that our heart is so pure to such an extent that we do not have any subsidiary purpose?
Are we on this earth doing different works in different regions and bearing different colors with different flavors?
Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:5, 'For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake'
Of course, we all would say that we never claimed the churches in this way, but we must consider what is unconsciously there in our heart
An American brother in Taipei, who was our family doctor, told us he needed a clean place where he could perform the operation
You must realize, though, that these churches are not your churches but are the Lord's churches and are a part of His Body
You also would never tell anyone that if they are not satisfied with the situation in their region to please come to your region
In addition, you would never tell people not to go to another region because the churches there are not worth seeing
If you did not have an improper, subconscious concept, you would never say that the churches in a certain region are not worth seeing
Regardless of how much you have done and how wonderful what you have done is, remember that it is not your work
The following fourteen points are crucial principles for the leading ones and the workers in the Lord's recovery
We must do things which fit in all the local churches and which would not damage or confuse the testimony of the Body of Christ
To do something merely under the consideration of the church in your locality which you are in is not adequate
We all know that with the fallen human beings and in our human nature to be different from others is a pride, a boast, and a glory
We must consider that in the Lord's recovery to be different from the other churches is a shame and an insult to the Lord's recovery
For the heavenly people and for God's heavenly purpose, God does not want and neither would He allow us to be different from others
More than two million people traveled together, marched together, bore the same ark, and had the same tabernacle for their worship center
They came out to promote your place and to ask people to go to your place saying that your place had the best church life
Thank the Lord that the fishing net of the Lord's recovery is spread over the entire country and in every corner
Sometimes their suspicion may even go further in causing them to think that what you said or did is a sign that you are going to rebel
You may not have done something or said something with that particular intention, but the negative effect still came out
It came to the United States from the Far East, and a good number of faithful ones in the Far East came to this country
Also, some faithful ones were raised up in the United States, and these dear ones have put their life into the Lord's recovery
Do not do anything or say anything that will stir up the faithful ones' concern for you and for the Lord's recovery
You must give people the liberty, the right, the freedom, the ease, and the peaceful feeling to say anything or do anything
At this time, Brother Sparks began to touch the matter of the church ground and did his best to annul this truth
Despite his warm welcome, he checked with a British sister who had been with him for years-'Why is Brother Lee coming'?
Do not work and care for your local church or for the local churches in your territory, but for the Lord's recovery
Even if you are working in your territory for the recovery, your consideration should always be that you are working for the Lord's recovery
Do not think that because a certain one is not faithful to you or another one offended you, you would cut them off
Even if people offend you intentionally, you must learn to forgive, to forget, and to maintain a good fellowship
All the churches, all the co-workers on this earth, and all the saints on this globe universally should be the same in our consideration
Sometimes certain ones not only said that their way was the right or the best way, but tried to convince others of this
It is true that we only receive the genuine believers, but we may make a mistake in this matter of discerning who is a genuine believer
A certain person, according to your feeling, might not be genuinely regenerated, yet he may be truly regenerated in fact
To receive people whom you are not sure whether or not they are truly regenerated is safer than not to receive them
They have to confess the Lord's name, As long as they believe in the Lord Jesus, and confess their sins, do not demand more of them
Do not practice any principle according to your kind of taste which actually is not your taste, but your peculiarity
The first portion concerning this matter is in Matthew 18:15-17: 'Now if your brother sins, go, reprove him between you and him alone
If he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
We cannot do it carelessly since this is not the human law but the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew
If we treasure the church fellowship highly, we would not cut people off from this fellowship, because it is so high
To cut off people so easily and so broadly means that we do not treasure the fellowship and that we do not value the fellowship properly
When we cut off something easily, this means that we do not treasure that item and that we deal with it cheaply
John 9-10 says, 'I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us
John did not tell the saints that they had to make a decision to cast Diotrephes out, although he was casting out people
John 10 says, 'If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice'!
All these Scriptures present cases which we have to consider in our fellowship concerning receiving the saints
We should not remove, cut off, someone from the fellowship of the church in a light manner, but we must do it carefully
To remove someone from the fellowship of the church is a great matter, so we should not do this too quickly but, rather, carefully
We must consider the possible damages which can be done by doing something of this nature in a fast and careless way
Even the law does not give the liberty to the church pastor to expose people's sin in this way because they must take care of their family
We have to keep the divine principle that only the saved ones can join the church and participate in the Lord's table
Fifty years ago in China, some in the Pentecostal movement required and instigated the public confession of sins
Something divisive which has happened and which has been manifested to everybody does not involve people's morality in principle
There is the possibility of meting out more punishment than is necessary because there is something in us which likes to punish people
Even in dealing with our children, we should not forget the principle of thirty-nine stripes rather than forty
Once you have thoroughly considered that you have no choice that a certain one has to be put out, then you must put him out
Since he was an enemy and an opponent already, there was no need to cut him off from the fellowship of the church
In the previous chapter, we studied portions of Scripture concerning the matter of cutting a saint off from the fellowship of the church
According to our understanding this means not to contact him, but in verse 15 Paul says to admonish him as a brother
Paul charged the saints there not to reject this brother at all; otherwise, Satan would have the ground to come in to the situation
Merely according to Paul's own word in 1 Corinthians 5, to remove this evil one does not constitute a kind of excommunication
We thought a public announcement was needed, but there is no hint in the New Testament that we need to make a public announcement
We just need to tell the sinning one, 'We have been waiting for your repentance and, thus far, we could not see it
Since you know the Lord is holy and His table is holy, please stay away, not only from the Lord's table but also from the church meetings'
The title of Psalm 88 reads A Song or Psalm for the sons of Korah to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite
Out of this rebellious family came the greatest prophet who turned the age into the age of the kingdom with the kingship-Samuel
Paul labored in such a way in writing 1 Corinthians and labored again to deal with this sinning brother in writing 2 Corinthians
We have to minister life to him to help him receive the life supply that he may regain his lost fellowship with the Lord
For the entire testimony of the Lord on this earth, we must learn to carry out the same ministry and to speak the same thing
Concerning the sinful cases in the local churches, we must deal with them by wisdom, with patience, and altogether in love
With the Gentiles there are kings and persons of high rank to govern them, but there should be nothing like this among the believers
When the Brethren were raised up in Britain, many people did their best to ascribe a name to them so that they could be denominated
There were different kinds of brothers in Europe which followed the principle that among the believers there should be no rank
It was Ignatius in the second century who mistakenly taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder
The two titles refer to the same person; elder denoting a person of maturity; overseer, denoting the function of an elder
Ignatius was a dear brother, but he made a big mistake in teaching that an overseer, a bishop, was higher than an elder
According to the actual situation of a shepherd and a flock, the shepherd, strictly speaking, cannot be an example to the flock
In God's economy, the shepherd and the flock all are men and all of them should be the same because the shepherd should be an example
Also according to the Lords word in the Gospels and to Peters words in his Epistle the holy Word does not allow the elder to control at all
The churches are God's possession, allotted to the elders as their allotments, their portions, entrusted to them by God for their care
The clear word of the New Testament does not allow or give any ground for the elders to take rank, position, or controlling power
If there is no rank, no position, and no controlling power for the elders, no one should be ambitious to be an elder
We must see that the holy Word takes away the rank, the position, and the controlling power of the elders; then no one would be ambitious
Far, we have seen that in the New Testament there is no rank for the elders, and in this sense there is no position for the elders
Peter, a fellow elder, charged the elders not to lord it over the flock but to be an example to take care of God's flock
We must see that the flock of God is not a flock of cattle but of men, so the shepherd can, should, and must be an example
We should reexamine the Bible to see if any verse indicates or even hints that the elders have been assigned with authority
Merely by looking at the words obey and submit we might understand that there is some authority with the elders
If we do not render the adequate leading, yet we claim, require, and demand obedience from the other members, this is a shame to us
According to 1 Timothy 3 and 5 we can see that the elders, first, have to manage the church just as a father manages his family, his house
Timothy 3:4-5 says concerning the elders, 'One who manages well his own household, having his children in subjection with all gravity; '
If a local church has some elders who in their care of a local church are like mothers raising up their children, this would be wonderful
If a local church among us has elders teaching their members as a mother raising up her children, that church will be very good
Every good university professor and every good teacher in the elementary school is always occupied day and night
We have to pray and labor, finding a way to present the messages which the saints would desire to take and have an appetite for
Even if you are a genuine, typical mother, your children will run away after two weeks if they are not fed properly
It would be ridiculous for any mother to try to get her children on her side without taking care of the cooking
If you take the political way of controlling the saints to win the saints over to you, you will lose your position
If you really mean business with Him, you do not need to take care of your position, and you do not need to think about your living
As we have seen, there are only three definitions used for the church-the church of God, the church of Christ, and the church of the saints
In verse 20 there are three pointsthose who sin refers to elders all refers to the whole church and the rest refers to the other elders
Of course, we have seen that even a small boy has a position in society, but in the sense of rank there is no position for the elders
Also, in a sense, no authority is ascribed to the elders based upon the Lord's word in Matthew 20:20-28 and Matthew 23:8-12
Peter also told us that he was an elder, yet he told his fellow-elders not to lord it over God's possession, the flock, but to be an example
The New Testament does not give the elders the authority in the sense of ruling, but there is still the sense of management
In this sense, we can see that in a local church there is God's arrangement to keep a local church in a good order
It was by this kind of overt understanding that Ignatius made a mistake which sowed the seed to produce the vast hierarchy in Christendom
In the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, there is actually no church and no Body of Christ, but just an organized, worldly system
Among the state churches, the worst one in the matter of hierarchy is the Church of England which is very close to the Roman Catholic Church
At that time, the Moravian brothers and many others suffered persecution from two sources-the Catholic Church and the state churches
Although the church life in Bohemia was not fully according to the Bible, it was still very much according to the Bible
We should practice the church life according to the instruction of the New Testament, not in a legal way, but in the way of life with love
If a husband firstly rules, he will eventually eat the fruit of separation and lastly he will eat the final fruit-divorce
As a leading one in the local church, you should not practice to attract a small number of saints to be your people, your group
That small group becomes not only your helper, but also your 'spies' to collect information for you to protect your interests
As a result, there is a basic element of competition compelling us to get helpers, especially when a brother becomes an elder
Spontaneously, then, a group is formed and sometimes this group which was formed was due to a very positive need
You may need some helpers in your work, but when you get the help you must try to stay away from forming a close group
God has ordained that only a couple, husband and wife, should be absolutely one, even one flesh without any distance
We all have to pray, 'Lord, have mercy upon us that in the local church where we are there would not be a spy'
We must also realize that the sisters, with their female nature, are very subjective and cannot be objective as easily as the brothers can
If you would tell some of the sisters not to form this kind of group around themselves they would say, 'Praise the Lord
Immediately after the brothers' speaking, this sister would always go to certain other sisters and never to some other ones
If we hold such an attitude of exercising our spirit to minister life to the flock, life itself will kill the germs
When the elders who are taking care of the church deal with some sinning ones, they should not condemn his family
We should love each other and we should trust in each other, yet we have to realize that we are all still human
In the church life we should always have caution and consideration, but this does not give you the ground to be suspicious
We must always keep in mind that the real, actual, and prevailing function of the elders is to minister life, to feed people
To invite a brother and sister together to dinner for the purpose of bringing them together should be done with adequate consideration
We do not control, and even the more, we do not conduct or indicate what brother or sister might be best for them
On the other hand, when the elders realize that some young saints are dating in an improper way, they must render them some help
They should tell the ones concerned that it is altogether not safe for a young brother to be with a young sister in a loose way
They also must consider things regarding their family, their parents, their job, their financial situation, and other responsibilities
We should help them to learn how to pray about their marriage and how to look to the Lord to restrict their indulgence and lust
To help them sign the papers for their marriage does not mean that we are doing our best to bring them together
The longer a church exists in a certain place, the greater the possibility there is that there would be involvement in these three matters
If we are careless and do not stand strictly in the truth, in life, and in love, it will be hard for us not to be contaminated
Since 1983 we have felt led of the Lord to take care of the Chinese-speaking work in the United States and in Canada
In 1967, though, the United States immigration law was renewed, giving a quota of twenty thousand immigrants to the Chinese people yearly
Beginning in 1982, the United States government added another twenty thousand to the quota of Chinese immigrants
Other immigrants include the direct relatives of these college graduates such as parents, wives, brothers, or sisters
Much prayer has been offered to the Lord by His faithful saints that today on this earth, the Chinese are easy to bring to the Lord
Among these Chinese immigrants over the years, a good number were saints who were among us in Taiwan and in Hong Kong
All the young ones among them, who were studying in the schools, became very prevailing factors among the scattered Chinese Christian groups
In these fellowships many of the speaking ones and leading ones are products of the churches in Taiwan and of the church in Hong Kong
Beginning in 1983, we felt that we could not go on any further without paying adequate attention to this part of the work
Within one year's time, from 1983 to 1984, twenty-nine Chinese-speaking meetings have been raised up in the local churches
A number of the churches can testify how the Lord has blessed this and how this has become a help to the church in their locality
The present situation among us is that the Chinese-speaking people, the community at large and the students, are very open to the gospel
They also have a hard time listening to the testimonies and they cannot praise or pray, uttering their feelings to the Lord freely
Some of their children are coming to our meetings, but they will not come because they cannot understand anything
In addition to this, even the younger generation who graduated from the schools in the United States still have a problem with the language
These Chinese-speaking meetings are a part of the local church and these meetings are still under the one eldership
All the churches can testify that the Chinese-speaking saints have really been a strengthening to the local churches
We have made it clear that anyone who can manage the English language for the purpose of the meeting must go to the English-speaking meeting
All these ones who are reaped will probably be able to give two weeks to attend a conference plus a training concerning the Christian life
Because of this situation, we felt that it might be very profitable to have some houses close to the major campuses
The reason why we could have over one thousand Chinese-speaking saints in a conference is because of this source of Taiwan
Among the Chinese immigrants who are living in the United States, quite a few thousand came from the source of the local churches
We are hoping that through this Chinese-speaking work, many of them will be brought back to the Lord's recovery
He is coming back as the Bridegroom to the church , as the Judge to the world , and as the very Savior to God's chosen people, Israel
When we compared Christendom with what we had seen of the Lord's vision we saw a great discrepancy, a great difference
We were young people who were purely seeking the Lord Himself according to His holy Scriptures and this shocked us
We heard a little concerning the name of Jesus Christ the Son of God, and we heard a little of the shallow gospel
At this juncture the Lord showed us the type in the Old Testament of the children of Israel being scattered to Syria to Egypt and to Babylon
We realized from the Old Testament that these ones who were turned to build up the destroyed temple were the remnant of God's people
The majority of the children of Israel remained in the heathen land, but only a small number, a remnant, came back to God's chosen land
The size of this temple was not as great as the original one, yet in principle it was the same and was considered as God's testimony
The first point is that we have seen God's vision and by God's vision we realized the real condition of today's Christendom
Nee took the lead to say that since the Lord had given us the truths in this age we must go out and send this truth to the denominations
The earth became wet for maybe one day, and then the next day all the water went back to the same place from where it was brought up
Even this, however, shows strongly that we did not cut ourselves off from other Christians, nor did we cut them off
What we can do and what we expect is that many of the Lord's children will take His Word, leave their captivity, and come back to join us
We are just a small part, just as the returned captives in the Old Testament were just a small remnant of all of the chosen people of God
We could not join them in that place because it is a place of captivity, full of divisions, organizations, and traditions
The Lord has been continually speaking to us, especially by opening up the New Testament to us, book after book
Even though we may have a small number, if we live the reality of the life of Christ, this is the testimony of Jesus
They will see people speaking the same thing in many different languages and bearing the genuine testimony of Jesus
Tell them that when Christ, our Redeemer, was on the cross, He was lifted up like the brass serpent in the wilderness
Eventually, he would be fully opened to the ministry you receive because he would realize that the truth is there
