   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S ORIGINAL CREATION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Genesis 1, God created man with His image to express His glory and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then in chapter two, we have the tree of life, which signifies God's intention for man to receive Him as life and to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE RESULT OF MAN'S FALL</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When man fell, he destroyed the image that God created for him, and lost the position of receiving God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The image that God created for man is one of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These things are the very essence of the Ten Commandments in the law, and they were created for man by God according to His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is a God of love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, He created love for man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is a God of light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, He created light for man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is a God of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, He created holiness in man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is a God of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, He created righteousness in man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But after man fell, he destroyed this image that God had created for him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition, God had barred the way to the tree of life by the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life Gen 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were unable to be reconciled again to God and to enjoy salvation in life until Christ died for us and redeemed us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>CHRIST'S REDEMPTION BY HIS VICARIOUS DEATH AND HIS SALVATION IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ's redemption by His vicarious death and His salvation in life first redeems fallen men so that they may be justified by God and reconciled to Him Rom 8:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition to this, He regenerates, sanctifies, renews, transforms, and conforms them to the image of the Son of God Rom 1:17b; 6:19b, 22b; 12:2; 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This conformation to the image of the Son of God begins from regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After regeneration there is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After sanctification there is renewing, and the renewing brings in transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When all these items are added together you have conformation to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, we will be made the sons of God 8:19 that Christ may become the Firstborn among many brothers 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, God gains a corporate expression, the mingling of His firstborn Son with His many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this way, we are enabled to enjoy God's salvation in life and are delivered from the expression of the natural life, having no self-boasting or self-esteem, and are conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Part of the third stanza of Hymns, #52 says:</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He leads the praise!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How precious to Thine ear The song He sings!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows us that it is most pleasing to God for the firstborn Son to lead the many sons into the praise of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second and third stanzas of Hymns, #1 say:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we view the vast creation, Planned with wondrous skill, So our hearts would move to worship, And be still.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But, our God, how great Thy yearning To have sons who love In the Son e'en now to praise Thee, Love to prove!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, the many sons are in the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, the firstborn Son includes the many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a corporate Son that is praising and exulting God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a profound truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But it has been written into a hymn and is explained in very simple words.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that you can all enter into these truths and can teach them to the new ones.</S>
