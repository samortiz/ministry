The next nine messages were given in Atlanta, Georgia, and the last seven messages were given in New York City, New York
They were originally published in The Stream, volumes 13 and 14, in May, August, November 1975 and February, May, August 1976
In his days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS
To see this we must realize that in order to fulfill His purpose God created man as the center of the universe
Though Satan came in through the woman, the Seed who would bruise the serpent's head also came in through the woman
We have another verse which speaks about the seed of Abraham: 'And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed'
Now we must see that this seed, Jesus, eventually becomes the branch, and this branch is called 'the Lord our righteousness'
It is easy to gather the doctrines and stories in the Bible, but to enter into the depth of the Bible is not easy
To know the teaching of the Bible is not difficult, but to realize the life that is conveyed in the Bible requires divine revelation
The Bible shows us that today God's temple is a group of living persons framed together and built up as God's habitation in the spirit
The only one that can build this temple is Jesus, and the way that He builds it is by being the seed, the branch, and the fruit
It is the branching out of this seed that will build God's temple, and it is this branch that bears the priesthood and the kingship
On the cross, He bruised the head of Satan, objectively, and now as the seed this bruising One is within us subjectively
Many times when the enemy begins to rise up within us against the building of God's house, this bruising life defeats him
The seed was mentioned in Genesis 3, but from that day it took a long period of time for this seed to enter into human soil
When the divine seed entered into human soil, the issue was a person who is the mingling of divinity with humanity
Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us
They answered, 'Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets'
Little did we know that Jesus is the branching out of divinity and the fruit of humanity that comes from the branching of divinity
We did not realize so clearly that this Jesus is the divine seed sown into us as human soil and that we must be so subjectively one with Him
Martin Luther fought for the doctrine of justification by faith, but today we do not need to fight for the doctrines
According to His divinity He is the branching out of God, and according to His humanity He is the fruit that comes out of the earth
When a seed is planted, it stretches out its element into the ground, and at the same time absorbs some element of the ground into itself
There were some so-called Christians even in the first century who did not believe that Christ was man as well as God
We have already read Isaiah 9:6, which clearly says that a Son is given to us, yet His name is called the Eternal Father
It is just as if someone came to Brother Benson this morning and said Brother Benson please show us Benson Phillips and well be satisfied
When a branch of an apple tree is grafted into a peach tree, the fruit produced from that branch will be a hybrid
As long as it remains on the shelf or in the refrigerator, however much we love it, it has nothing to do with us
We can talk about a chicken, study it, and know everything about it, but unless we take the chicken into us, it does us absolutely no good
In this message we will not cover anything from the Gospels of Mark and Luke, but we will look a little into the first and last Gospel
We must realize that not only the composition of the Scriptures is God's breathing, but also the arrangement of the books
In just the first three chapters of John we see that He is five things: the Word, God, the flesh, the Lamb, and the Bridegroom
God's people in John, chapter ten, were confined in the Jewish religion, and Jesus came to be the door that they might come out
We must all know that the Jesus who is on the throne in the third heavens at the right hand of God is now so real as the Spirit on the earth
Right now, wherever we are, if we will call, 'O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus,' something will happen, and we will get something
We know that when He went to the cross His side was broken and out came blood and water blood for redemption and water for imparting life
We all have something within us that has come out of Christ, and it is by this that we will be builded up and return to Christ as His bride
After His resurrection He came back to His disciples to breathe upon them and said, 'Receive ye the Holy Breath'
Regardless of how John starts, or from whom Matthew begins, eventually they both tell us nearly the same thing
And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them'?
Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom
Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit'
As they are baptizing them they say, 'I now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit'
It is the same Greek preposition used in Galatians 3:27, where it is properly translated by the King James Version
May the Lord remove all the veils from our background and from our concepts that we may see the vision from the pure Word
In these two Gospels it is so clear that the main purpose of the gospel is for Christ to be the Bridegroom to obtain His bride
He is the wonderful Bridegroom, and He is everything to us that we might become His bride as His counterpart for eternity
Before producing the church, He was the individual Christ, but after producing the church, this wonderful person becomes the Body-Christ
They have seen that He died on the cross for our sins, was buried, resurrected, and is now in the third heavens at the right hand of God
The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners'
Regardless of whether they were a sinner, a publican, or a Pharisee, He did whatever He could to impart Himself to them
By His eating, Matthew was fully caught, and in time one of the foremost publicans became one of the foremost disciples
To build the church is not simply to bring people to the Lord, that they may obtain some kind of church membership
In chapter two, we immediately see the negligence of religion and the persecution from politics towards this wonderful person
And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness'
If it means nothing, why don't you buy some paper, pencils, and erasers and bring them to the office for the company to use?
He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God'
The people which sat in darkness saw a great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up'
Jesus is the greater temple with the presence of God the greater Jonah with the power of God and the greater Solomon with the wisdom of God
We may be the youngest in the family, yet the whole family senses that we are so powerful, so wise, and so much in God's presence
Regardless of how wonderful the One who indwells us is, religion will never change, and politics will never agree
If we would know the way Christ builds His church, we must realize all the things that have been mentioned in this message
In other words, we must be the real Nazarenes, the real fulfillers of righteousness, and the real feeders on God's Word
We must also be a light shining over the people where we are, and have the greater temple, the greater Jonah, and the greater Solomon
When Jesus said that He would build His church, He did not say it in the second or third chapter of Matthew, but in the sixteenth chapter
Many people talk about the universal church in Matthew sixteen, but they miss the words of Jesus in Matthew eighteen
In Matthew twenty-one, we see that Jesus was rejected not as the Savior or Redeemer, but as the building stone
He said that He would build His church, but the religious ones rejected Him as the cornerstone for God's building
Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations , baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit'
By taking Him as our life, He will fully qualify us for God's building, because everything He is, is for the producing of the church
The first chapter tells us that Christ was the son of David and the son of Abraham and He was born of a virgin Mary and given the name Jesus
The incarnation of Jesus was purposeful, planned by God in eternity past, even before the heavens and earth were created
The people which sat in darkness saw a great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up'
Many Christians love the Gospel of John because it tells us that Jesus is the life, the truth, the way, the door, and so many other things
While Jesus was traveling and saying so many wonderful things, the religious ones were continually questioning Him
Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save
Before the incarnation in chapter one, the promise of the seed of the woman traveled four thousand years from Genesis 3:15
The seed of woman came in chapter one and from chapter one to twenty-eight, He was fully processed to become the resurrected Christ
Now He is no longer just God, but the God who has traveled through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, and resurrection
He is God, who after being made flesh took a further step by death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
When we baptize others, we must exercise our faith to realize that we are putting them into Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the Triune God
In Matthew 28:19 the Lord tells us to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
To understand this, we must also read Galatians 3:27, 'For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ'
In these verses we see that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself
There are many verses in the New Testament which tell us that the Father is in us, the Son is in us, and the Spirit is in us
He is our life, our light, our power, our strength, our holiness, our righteousness, our love, our kindness, and our peace
To baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit really has a deeper meaning than most have realized
Vincent comments about baptizing into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as recorded in Matthew 28:19
The kingdom of Jesus is revealed in this book, but it is really difficult for anyone to understand it properly
If you were to ask them concerning the gospel of the kingdom, they would say that they have never heard of such a thing
He did not say that man should repent to enter the heavens, but to repent for the kingdom of the heavens is near
He came not to rule over us in an outward way, but as a king to enter into us in order to consume all our rebellious element
Jesus came as a king to impart Himself into us that He might discharge all our rebellious element, and replace it with Himself
The Brethren teachers say that the kingdom was suspended, and that Jesus brought in the church to replace it until the time of the kingdom
After resurrection, we are told in Acts 1:3 that Jesus spent forty days speaking to the disciples about the kingdom
When we begin to pray like this, something deep within is flowing, living, working, watering, enlightening, strengthening, and reigning
When Jesus came to preach the kingdom, He did not preach to the Gentiles, but to those who knew the Scriptures
Not every one that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven
Many Christians have done things in the name of the Lord, but the Lord will never own or approve that kind of thing
In the Lord's eyes, even prophesying and casting out demons in the name of the Lord not according to God's will is lawlessness
Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit'
When we baptize people into the Triune God, we baptize them into Christ, into the kingdom seed, and into the kingdom!
Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us
After three and one half years with the disciples as the Word become flesh, He told them that He was going to leave them
A good number of Christians even today are still opposing us because we say that the Bible teaches this matter
Suppose you were to go to Mongolia to preach the gospel with only one book of the Bible, and that book was Matthew
The reason they do not mention this is because they both tell us that He is going to be with us and in us all the time
We must all see that His goal is not simply to be our life, our comfort, our strength, and so many other things
The goal is the producing of the proper church, which is the building of God's temple and the preparation of the Lord's Bride
It is wonderful to be saved, and it is really wonderful to be sanctified, to be spiritual, and to have abundance of life
Jacob in Genesis 28:12-19 had a dream, and in that dream Jacob saw a ladder on the earth rising into the heavens
There was no problem as far as John was concerned, for he fully understood what he was doing, but his disciples did not understand
It has nothing to do with outward teaching, instruction, adjusting, or improving-this is not the way of the Lord's preparation
Jesus fell into the earth and died, but in His resurrection we were all raised up as grains to be made into one loaf
To have the oneness and to be built up into one body is far from the concept and practice of today's Christianity
Matthew and John are different in many aspects, but as we have seen in the last message, they are also very much alike
Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit'
From the Hebrew text, we see that in Genesis 1:1, the word 'God' as the subject of the sentence is in plural number
In Genesis 11, men had become so rebellious against God that they built the tower of Babel and the city of Babel
God said: 'Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech'
There is another occasion in the Old Testament when God uses the plural pronoun for Himself, and it is also related to man
In the first book of the New Testament, Matthew, we see how God became incarnated, born of a virgin, to be a man called Jesus
Now He charges us to baptize people into the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit that is to baptize them into this Triune God
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all
Now we need to see that the dispensing of the Triune God is that Christ may be our life supply for the producing of the Bride
We have our own personality, but if we mean business with the Lord for the church life, we must take Him as our person
To have a successful marriage, the wife must be covered by her husband; she must take her husband as her person
When He was on the earth, although He had a personality, He never lived by Himself; He always lived by the person of the Father
In the church life, as individuals, we all must put aside our person and take the very Lord within us as our person
The only thing we must now do is to put aside our person, our way of life, and take Him as our person and His will as our will
And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight
Many Christians know that Jesus ascended to the heavens after His resurrection but not many know the real meaning of the ascension of Christ
He has been exalted far above all principalities, powers, might, and dominion, and above every name that is named
Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ'
Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins'
Why at His ascension is He given the same name, the name to which every knee should bow and every tongue should confess?
Before the Lord's ascension, He could give the gifts, but in a sense, He did not have the official position to do it
When a president of the United States is elected, he does not officially take office until the day of his inauguration
Not until the day Jesus was exalted by the right hand of God to the highest place in the universe did God make the declaration
On the evening of the same day He openly showed His disciples His hands and His side and bid them to handle Him
Christ was anointed and appointed to accomplish God's eternal purpose, which is to build up His temple, the New Jerusalem
In this way God told the whole universe that this is the very one whom He has appointed to accomplish His eternal plan
Elijah, David, Moses, and Adam did not know any of these things, but today the smallest one among us knows them all
Later, Peter said, 'This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved'
Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins'
It was too bad that she was so distracted by the family life that she did not care to hear about the church life
In His inauguration He was given the Holy Spirit of promise, all the gifts from the Holy Spirit, and all the members
Of course, even the attention that has been paid to the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ has not been adequate
Almost two thousand years ago, four thousand years after Adam's creation, there was a man by the name of Jesus
All that was sinful, old, rotten, fallen, corrupt, devilish, demonic, and satanic was ended by the cross of Christ!
The cross of Christ terminated all the old, negative things, and the resurrection of Christ brought forth a new start
Let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ'
Most Christians have never seen the ascension of Christ in a full way because today's Christians do not pay much attention to the church
Have you ever realized that Christ is a qualified builder to carry out God's project of building the New Jerusalem?
God made Christ the Author of life in order that Christ would take all His chosen people and put His divine life into every one of them
One day while he was on his way to suppress the believers of the Lord, the wonderful Lord came to him, and he was knocked to the ground
Many of the young people can testify that after they were hooked for the Lord's building, they loved the Lord more
Once we have been collected, we have the life within, we have the Spirit, and we have all the persons as gifts to the Body
All of these persons are the materials collected, filled with life, empowered with the Spirit, and talented with the spiritual abilities
These gifts are for the perfecting of the saints to the work of the ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ
The crucifixion terminates and ends every negative thing: sin, the world, the flesh, the old man, the self, and Satan
He was positioned, authorized, and inaugurated into His post to carry out God's project of building God's eternal dwelling place
In His ascension He has been qualified, approved, appointed, and even committed with the divine life, the Holy Spirit, and all the gifts
Many Christian teachers do hold the concept that the Father Son and Spirit are three Gods but they dare not to express this in words openly
2 Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
He was one-hundred percent against the teaching that speaking in tongues is the unique manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit
Andrew Murray was a very spiritual person, yet in his books you cannot find anything about him speaking in tongues
Corinthians 3:17 says, 'Now the Lord is that Spirit,' and 1 Corinthians 15:45 says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
When we come to the matter of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, it is absolutely not wise to separate Christ from the Spirit
Many Christian teachers insist on saying that Christ is the baptizer, but here it says that we have been baptized into Christ
On the day of Pentecost the ascended approved and inaugurated Christ came down in the form of the Spirit into whom His people were immersed
It does not mean that today, when a sinner repents and confesses to the Lord Jesus, the Lord comes to die for him
Paul did not say 'with all that read the Bible,' or 'with all that speak in tongues,' but 'with all that call upon the name of the Lord'
Ultimately this corporate entity will consummate in the New Jerusalem, the eternal expression of God in a corporate way
If we do not have such a governing principle, our understanding of the Bible will be loose, wild, and full of error
The first was incarnation, the second was crucifixion, the third was resurrection, and the fourth was the ascension
In the same principle, before we were born, we were on one hand redeemed and on the other hand terminated in Christ
The coming advent of Christ is the completion of the corporate mingling of divinity with humanity for eternity
It has been completed in two parts: with the Jews at Pentecost, and with the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius
The Lord told Ananias that Saul was saved, and he must go there to confirm it so that Saul might become a useful vessel to the Lord
Whatever had been accomplished on the Body would flow into the new members through the channel of the laying on of hands
Many times in the book of Acts it tells us that many people believed in the Lord Jesus without mentioning the baptism in the Spirit
Some so-called Pentecostals and charismatics say that on the day of Pentecost all spoke in tongues, but let us look carefully at the verses
And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance'
Let us read Acts 196 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Spirit came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied
If anyone uses these verses to ask if you speak in tongues, you had better ask them if they handle serpents and drink any deadly thing
Most of the tongue-speaking Christians say that tongue speaking is the unique manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit
Most believe that you could be regenerated, but you could not have the baptism in the Holy Spirit unless you speak in tongues
Today so many so-called tongue-speaking people only utter the same few sounds repeatedly, which can hardly form a dialect
We only need to take it by faith as we did the incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension
There are many concepts regarding the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and many divisions have been created by all these concepts
The second school says that if you do not speak in tongues, you have not experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit
Evan Roberts later worked with Jessie Penn-Lewis, who was absolutely against the so-called Pentecostal movement
To say that speaking in tongues is over is too much, but to say that everyone must speak in tongues is also too much
Many tongue speakers say that you must turn your jaw and exercise your tongue, saying something like, 'Praise Jesus,' very fast
Several times in the meetings of the churches some people have spoken in tongues and even gave the interpretation, but we did not stop them
When they come into our meetings, the first thing they look for is whether there is the speaking of tongues with interpretation or not
After reading all the above verses, does the Apostle Paul encourage people to speak in tongues in the meetings or discourage them?
It is clear in this passage that what is needed for the building up of the church is not the tongue speaking, but the prophesying
They say that to prophesy is only to foretell, and they have their way to do it like the Old Testament prophets
If you would spend time to attend their meetings and listen to all their predictions, you would see that there is nearly no fulfillment
We thought that to exercise the gifts meant to speak in tongues or to prophesy by saying, 'Thus saith the Lord'
At the end of 1 Corinthians 12, Paul tells us to seek the greater gifts, yet he would show us a most excellent way
If we only had the baptism accomplished once and for all, and were waiting for Him to come back, we would be miserable
After we are redeemed we need the life supply the lifegiving and Christ as the lifegiving Spirit is the indweller to supply the life to us
Most Christians have never realized that there is such a verse in the Bible, telling us that the Lord Jesus is with our spirit
Romans 8:9-10 tells us that this Christ in our spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God
By these verses we can see that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is just Christ Himself
Gradually the fingers of the hand get into the fingers of the glove, and finally the hand is fully formed in the glove
Of all He is in our spirit; then gradually He will spread into every part of our heart until He has fully made His home there
To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory'
While we are living out Christ, we are waiting for the day when this indwelling Christ will become our outward glory
Our very living will become the manifestation of Christ, and we will be waiting for His coming to become our outward glory
What we eat and drink is assimilated into our being and becomes something organic that belongs to our constitution
Next we saw through Galatians 220 that we have been crucified with Christ nevertheless we live yet it is not we but Christ who lives in us
There is no doubt that we do get help from our wives and husbands, but at the same time there is a real suffering in order to get the help
The main reason for all divorces is the fact that one couple has two heads, two wills, two minds, two emotions, and two persons
If all the followers of Christ would deny themselves, there would be no need of so many pages in the New Testament
If we really mean to take Christ as our person, we must know how to deny our mind and to have our mind fully replaced by the mind of Christ
He did not do anything in his own person; he did everything in the person of Christ because he was taking Him as his person
Romans 84 says That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to flesh but according to spirit
Whatever the law requires we will spontaneously fulfill, not by ourselves, but through Christ, the Spirit moving in our spirit
Day by day we should not have our being according to teaching, feelings, concepts, or circumstances, but according to the mingled spirit
Praise the Lord that we do have a spirit and that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is indwelling our spirit to make these two spirits one
Now we must walk according to this mingled spirit, and to walk according to this spirit is to take Christ as our person
In the entire Bible, especially in the New Testament, there is not one verse which tells us that we must walk according to Bible teaching
The water of life flows into us and brings all the divine elements into our being to replace our natural essence
Teaching can never do this because teaching does not have the flow of the living water with the divine element
In the New Jerusalem there will be nothing natural, for whatever is built into God's building must be transformed
Wherever there is a church without such a measure of transformation, that church will be weak, poor, and shaky
We will become the precious stones which are good for the building up of God's building which is the Body of Christ
Romans 15:6 says, 'That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ'
In the following verse, he says that Christ reconciled both of these two peoples unto God in one Body by the cross
By reading these two verses it is clear that the one new man is the one Body and the one Body is the one new man
The philosophers would say that this is impossible, but we do know that this is a fact for we have experienced this fact
When we all take Christ as our person, spontaneously we will all be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion
He quoted 1 Corinthians 14:34, 'Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak'
On the cross Christ has also dealt with another itemthe ordinances which are the different ways of living and the different ways of worship
We like to be with our relatives, our friends, our neighbors, and our classmates in order to have a kind of social life
For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ'
He was God, He became flesh for redemption, and He became the life-giving Spirit to come into us and work within us
The Redeemer, through death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit to be the indwelling One, which is the third stage
Some Christians are in the third stage, realizing that Christ not only died for them, but also that He lives within them as their life
Now in the church life we are not only enjoying God, the Redeemer, and the indwelling One, but also the Body-Christ
The more we experience Christ, the more riches and the more enjoyment of the Body-Christ there will be in the church life
In these messages we have seen God's purpose and plan, which is to work Himself into us that we might be built up into the one new man
God only created one man, and out of this one man a part was taken from his broken side with which God built a woman
God did not create another half for Adam; He put him to sleep and took a part out of his side and built this part into a woman
The New Testament tells us clearly that Christ came not only to be our Redeemer, but also to be the Bridegroom
One day this corporate Eve will be brought back to Him, and He will say, 'This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh
We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ, the new man, the Bride, and the dwelling place, or the temple of God
All the buildings of Satan, such as the city and tower of Babel, the pleasure cities of Egypt, and Babylon, were built with bricks
We need something new, something divine, something heavenly, something holy, and something eternal to replace our natural make-up
Among today's Christians, it would be difficult to find a place where you could hear someone give a message on transformation
What we must do is learn to take Christ in every day, eating Him by pray-reading the Word, and drinking Him by calling on His name
There are thousands of real Christians there, but can you go into their denomination to be built up with them?
Today, especially in this country, there are hundreds of free groups meeting in their homes and in many other places
People are always telling us that we are narrow because we take care of the ground of the church, the site for the building
Following this they come to the third brother and tell him about the Lord Jesus, and ask him to come home to be the family with them
Since 1962, a strong testimony of the local churches has been raised up by the Lord, starting from Los Angeles
Twelve years ago it was opposed, but in the last five years so many so-called free groups have begun to call themselves the local church
They said that they were the local church, and that they would not have fellowship with all the other local churches
According to the Bible, the Body of Christ is universally one, comprising all the saints and all the local churches
All the local churches, regardless of whether they are in this city, in this country, or in other countries, are the one Body of Christ
In administration, all the local churches have their own jurisdiction, but in fellowship they must still be one
A local church is one that is open to all the saints in that locality and open to all the other local churches
If any group refuses to fellowship with the other local churches, they have lost the ground of unity and have become sectarian
Since so many free groups have picked up the name of the local church, we must discern what a proper local church is
At the end of each of the seven epistles, the Lord says, 'He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches'
Galatians is a book that was not written to an individual local church, but to all the local churches in Galatia
They were different in their corruption and in their degradation, but in the positive things, they were all the same
The wall of the city has four sides, yet every side is built with the same material, jasper, and looks the same
In the past few chapters in this book we have seen Christ as the wonderful One in the four Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles
If we simply read the black and white letters and understand with our mentality, we never see the clear revelation in the Bible
John 1:14 tells us something more: 'And the Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth'
In Numbers 21, God told Moses to make a brass serpent and put it on a pole to save those who were bitten by the fiery serpents
It says For as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is the Christ
Eventually the log still appears as a log, but the interior element has been discharged and replaced with something new
Today He is the living water flowing through us to bring in the divine minerals and replace all our old element
When Jesus came, He was recommended by John the Baptist not only as the Lamb of God, but also as the Bridegroom
In the book of Revelation we are told that the wife has made herself ready, and the marriage of the Lamb has come
Eventually in the book of Revelation the harvest is ripe, and the bride is ready to be the New Jerusalem as the Body-Christ for eternity
We will be wholly saturated with Him and eventually there will only be one entity the mingling of divinity with humanity in a corporate way
Today in the church life we are enjoying the foretaste of the Body-Christ that will be consummated in the New Jerusalem
The seven Spirits of God in Revelation do not mean seven different Spirits, but the one Spirit intensified seven times
The context of these verses in Zechariah shows that the lampstand, which signifies the Spirit of God in God's move, is for God's building
In the same principle, the sevenfold intensified Spirit in the book of Revelation is for the building of God's dwelling place
While they were praying and worshipping in a formal and religious way, Jesus went into a common house in Bethany
The religious people thought they had the proper worship according to their Scriptures, yet they did not know that they missed God
He led His disciples to eat in the cornfield on the Sabbath day , and the religious Sabbath patrol caught them
Not long after its establishment the church became a religion with positions regulations and forms having little that was living or real
They had very little if any experience of Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling them as a spiritual reality
We may dress nicely to attend 'church' on Sunday morning, carrying our Bible in our hand, but all without Christ
Satan does not fear the Bible in letters, but he flees when he hears someone calling on the name of the living Christ
They search the inmost part of our heart, discerning our thoughts and motives with sharper perception than any X-ray
Before they went to the meeting, they said what they liked; but after going, Christ always seems to be there to regulate their speaking
The burning, searching, enlightening, and observing reality of Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in the local churches
At the end of each epistle it says, 'He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches'
Instantly the Lord speaks to one church in particular, but constantly the Spirit speaks the same word to all the churches
In their degradation they are different, but in nature, in essence, in purpose, and in ministry they are all the same
Originally it is the Spirit speaking to the churches; eventually it becomes the speaking of the Spirit and the Bride
If we are still in the realm of doctrine, arguing about which doctrine is right and which is wrong, we have missed the mark
In this kind of situation, the Lord asks us to listen to the sevenfold intensified Spirit with the seven burning lamps and the seven eyes
We must realize that nearly all the symbols in the book of Revelation are already mentioned in the Old Testament
Now we see that for God's building and God's administrative government, His Spirit is the seven lamps burning with fire
There are many things in the Bible which are new to us, and we must learn how to get into all the parts of this consistent revelation
Matthew chapter one tells us that a virgin will conceive and bring forth a Son, who is to be called Jesus, which means Jehovah the Savior
It is certain that before Jesus came, God was only God; He was never mingled with man, and He never came to be with man
In the beginning there was only God, but at the consummation, God is surrounded by a big city with a high wall built up with precious stones
Following this, in the house of Cornelius, He collected all His Gentile believers and baptized them into Himself
Although the Lord does indwell us when we are born again, it takes a longer period of time for Him to fully indwell us
Whenever we call 'Lord Jesus,' that is to drink one body once and for all, but now we have been made to drink of one Spirit
May the Lord open our eyes to realize that He wants to take us over, possess us, fill us, and saturate us with Himself
He wants to fully indwell our mind, our emotion, our will, and our conscience that He may make His full home in our heart
In the book of Ephesians Paul never prayed that the Ephesian Christians might be baptized in the Spirit and speak in tongues
Whether you are quiet or noisy, whether you wear long hair or short hair, whether you are circumcised or uncircumcised is not the question
Poor Christianity followed by using their thirty-nine books plus twenty-seven more in the New Testament to form a Christianity religion
When Christ came to the Jewish people, according to their point of view, He did things against their Scriptures
In Revelation 4:2 John said, 'I was in spirit; and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne'
It was in spirit that John saw the churches, the judgment of the world, the great Babylon, and the New Jerusalem
John Nelson Darby in his New Translation of the Bible puts verses seven through sixteen of 2 Corinthians, chapter three, into parentheses
When all the captives returned to Jerusalem, and saw the foundation of the temple laid, they all shouted for joy
Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise'?
The Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him'
He no longer needs to offer the sacrifices, but He does need to dress the lampstands by filling them with oil and snuffing the burnt wick
Today He is our High Priest, walking among the churches, supplying the oil and snuffing the waste to make all the churches shining
He is the priestly Person taking care of His shining churches, and He is the life supply to all the overcomers
Sooner or later, whether it is this year or next, we will be in His presence and have an exposure that will frighten us to death
The concept of the living Christ who has such a care for the churches is to give His dear ones something to eat
The first two promises were concerned just with eating, but in the last promise there is the feasting together with the Lord
Of course some will say that we should not hold on to the wrong doctrines such as the doctrine of Balaam and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans
Nearly all Christians in this country have been killed by the teachings, doctrines, and knowledge of the Bible
We originally were a piece of clay, but by eating Christ as the hidden manna, we are transformed into a stone good for God's building
When we put all the seven epistles together, we see that it is by eating Jesus that we will be transformed into a stone for God's building
Of all we have the Son of Man as our High Priest caring for the churches by filling them with oil and cutting off all the oldness
These seeds continue to grow until all these points reach the harvest of God's revelation in the last and consummate book
After this, more solid light was needed, so the sun, the moon, and the stars as the light bearers were revealed
Following this highest light, the tree of life as the highest life, the life on the highest plane, was revealed
Manna was just a small round thing, yet we know from John 6 that manna is a picture of Jesus as the bread of life
Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city'
If the church is genuine in the Lords recovery Jesus is there with a face like the shining sun with flaming eyes and with burning brass feet
And the nations shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it'
The New Jerusalem will not only be full of light, but even the nations around the New Jerusalem will walk in the light of the city
In the Gospel of John, we only have the seed of Christ being the light, but in Revelation there is the harvest
In this book Christ is not only the light, but also the shining sun full of glory, enlightening the whole world
Before the Lord comes back to enlighten the whole world, He is now walking among the local churches shining over us
The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches: and the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches'
In the church age, the lamps are the seven Spirits, but when we arrive in the New Jerusalem, the lamp will be the Lamb
And the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the Lamb is the lamp thereof
If we read Revelation 21 and 22 properly, we see that the New Jerusalem is a mountain of gold, just like a golden stand
Christ is the lamp, and within this lamp is God as the light Therefore, Christ shines out God, and the city shines out Christ
Our God is the light, His Christ is the lamp, and we are the golden lampstands holding the lamp shining out the light
And there appeared a great sign in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars
Brother Nee points out that the woman in Revelation 12 denotes all God's chosen people, from the patriarchs, through Israel, to the church
The sun will still shine during the time of the New Jerusalem, but there will be no need of the sun, because of the brightness of the city
And there shall be no night there; and they need no lamp, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light'
Suppose the electric light is burning in our room in the morning, and then the sun begins to shine in the window
In the churches Christ is walking and observing with his seven flaming eyes; so the churches are full of light
They always talked about the beasts, the ten horns, the seven eyes, or sometimes the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven vials
The firstfruits of His farm will not be brought into the 'barn' in the air, but to the temple which is on mount Zion in the heavens
When we come to the book of Revelation we must spend most of our time with these five aspects as well as all the revelation regarding Christ
We should forget about the Antichrist the ugly beast the ten horns and the wrong set of sevens and spend our time with Christ and the church
And she brought forth a manchild, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne'
They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their soul lives unto the death'
The church is not only the lampstand the woman that produces the manchild to defeat the enemy and the ripened crop but also Christs Bride
Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready
To her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, bright and pure: for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints'
Jesus told us that if we are thirsty, we should come to Him and drink, and out of our innermost being will flow rivers of living water
Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city'
By eating Jesus as the tree of life and by drinking the Spirit we will be strong to deal with the enemy of God
The tree of life is not like a tall tree, but as a vine, stretching all the way down the street in the flow of living water
Once we enter the gate, we have three things before us: a unique street to walk on, a unique river to drink of, and a unique tree to eat of
What we need is the proper eating and drinking that comes in the flow in the one street that leads to the throne of God
Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man
His purpose is to have a group of human beings that He may work Himself into them so that they might bear His image
And what if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory'
Our parents not only gave us man's image, but also man's life; but God in His creation only gave man His image, not His life
God made man as His container with His image, and then He put this living container before a tree symbolizing Himself as life
God's first attempt to cause man to take Him in as food was a failure because of man's unfaithfulness in the garden of Eden
In John 6 as the bread of life, a process is necessary, for man had fallen, and there was the need of redemption
When we get into eternity, we will still see that Christ is the Lamb, but at that time we will not need the blood
As we read through the whole Bible, we begin to see that the tree of life is just God Himself presented to man in the form of food
While we are in the classroom, while we are at work, while we are at home, there is something flowing within us
They were originally something else, but under the proper conditions they were transformed into precious stones
When Andrew first brought Peter to the Lord, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone
The Lord was telling Peter that he was a stone to be built upon Himself as the rock for the producing of the church
Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved'
Many Christians preach this word concerning the name of Jesus, but they never touch the previous verse about the stone
The seed of the tree of life was sown in Genesis, but the harvest of the tree of life is at the end of Revelation
Having the glory of God; and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal'
In the Old Testament the temple was God's habitation, and now this city-temple will be God's habitation for eternity
In this way we can see that the New Jerusalem is not a physical building, but a living composition composed of all God's chosen people
Every saint in eternity will lose his identification, but this does not mean that we will lose our personality
The book of Revelation is a book of symbols, so to understand this book, we need to find the real meaning of all the symbols
The whole city is the temple, twelve thousand furlongs, by twelve thousand furlongs, by twelve thousand furlongs
Teachings may correct you, and regulations may improve you somewhat, but they can never metabolize you; they can never transform you
If He had come in a glorious way with two camps of angels escorting Him, all the people of Israel would have received Him
The Jews paid all their attention to the verses concerning circumcision and the keeping of the Sabbath, but they missed Isaiah 9:6
It forced God to give Peter a vision to show him that what He had cleansed Peter should not call common or unclean
He was very bold to say, 'For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation'
Paul tells us that in the last days there is the danger that some will have the form of godliness without the power
He is putting the riches of His element into us to discharge all our old, natural element and replace us with Himself
In the New Jerusalem there will be no teachings of right or wrong, but the total mingling of divinity with humanity
Because the grain of sand abides at the wound, the oyster secretes a kind of life juice around the grain of sand
It was not by joining or by being sprinkled, but by realizing that in all this world full of death there is Someone living
Once we enter the gate, we have three things: the golden street, the flow of the river of life, and the tree of life
We have published a book entitled, How To Meet, and by the title many have thought that it gives directions concerning how to meet
If we will take the divine nature as our way, the Triune God will flow all of His divine elements into our being
When we take care of God's divine nature within, we sense that the water of life is flowing, and the tree of life is supplying
While we are walking in the divine way, drinking the living water, and eating the tree of life, something is getting into us
The three categories of precious materials-gold, pearl, and precious stones-also show us the work of the Triune God
In history Madame Guyon and Brother Lawrence were very spiritual, yet they remained in the Roman Catholic Church
The Roman Catholic Church abounds with idol worship, yet undoubtedly some of her people are real brothers and sisters in the Lord
The Lord says, 'Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues'
All the principles of this church life are clearly portrayed in the New Jerusalem by the working of the Triune God within us
