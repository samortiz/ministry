<h2 class=head2>H. In His Walk</h2><p>In Leviticus 1, the legs of the burnt offering signify Christ’s walk, just as the head signifies His wisdom. We need to experience Christ in His walk.<p>In Matthew 11:29 the Lord Jesus says, “Take My yoke on you and learn from Me.” This is to take the Lord’s legs, His walk, and to experience Him in His walk.<p>“You did…so learn Christ” (Eph. 4:20). To learn Christ is to have His legs and feet in order to live, walk, and move exactly as He did.<p>“Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ” (1 Cor. 11:1). This verse indicates that Paul did not walk by his own legs and feet but walked by the legs and feet of Christ.<p>Peter also experienced Christ in His walk. This is indicated by his word about following in Christ’s steps: “Leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps” (1 Pet. 2:21). Both Paul and Peter walked by the legs and feet of Christ as a burnt offering to God.<h2 class=head2>I. In His Being Kept by the Holy Spirit from Defilement</h2><p>Finally, we may experience Christ in His experiences as the burnt offering in His being kept by the Holy Spirit from defilement. This is indicated in Leviticus by the washing of the legs and inwards of the burnt offering.<p>Paul refers to our experience of this washing in 1 Corinthians 6:11 and in Titus 3:5. First Corinthians 6:11 says, “You were washed…in the Spirit of our God.” If we daily experience such a washing and then come to offer Christ as our burnt offering, we shall be able to offer Him according to our experience. If we do not have the experience of being washed by the Holy Spirit, we shall not have the capacity to offer a burnt offering that has been washed. We need to experience Christ in His being washed by the Holy Spirit.<p>In Titus 3:5 Paul speaks of the “renewing of the Holy Spirit.” This renewing is also related to our experience in our daily life of being kept from defilement by the washing of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>III. OFFERING THE CHRIST WE HAVE EXPERIENCED</h2><p>We need to offer to God as a burnt offering the Christ whom we have experienced. In Romans 8:11 Paul says, “He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.” Then in Romans 12:1 he goes on to say, “Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.” In Colossians 1:28 Paul speaks of presenting “every man full-grown in Christ.” This is to offer to God as the burnt offering the Christ we have experienced.<p>The situation among Christians today is that very few have Christ to offer as the burnt offering. Where can you find a group of Christians who daily offer to God as a burnt offering the Christ they have experienced? Regarding this, what is the situation among us? I am concerned about the fact that we also are short of experiences. This is the reason many saints have nothing to utter in the Lord’s table meeting or in the prayer meeting. We may want to offer praise to God, but if we are lacking in the experience of Christ’s experiences, we shall not have anything to utter. However, if we are full of the experience of Christ’s experiences as the burnt offering, we shall have rich utterance in praise not only in the meetings but also in our private time with the Lord. Therefore, we should endeavor to experience Christ daily in all His aspects as the burnt offering. Then, having much experience of Him, we shall be able to offer to God the Christ we have experienced. Our prayers and praises will be the release of our experiences of Christ.
