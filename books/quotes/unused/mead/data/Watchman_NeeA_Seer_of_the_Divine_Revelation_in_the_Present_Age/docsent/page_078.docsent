   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Law of Sin and Death</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchman Nee saw from the Scriptures that to sin and die is a law Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This law is in the members of our body Rom 7:23 and is derived from the evil life of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every fallen man is under its power.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the law of the Spirit of life is more powerful than the law of sin and death and is able to free us from it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>31.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A Better Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The new covenant which the Lord Jesus enacted for us with His blood is better than the old covenant Heb 7:22; 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The old covenant is according to the Old Testament law, with a priesthood according to the law of a fleshy commandment; whereas, the new covenant is according to the law of life, with a priesthood according to the power of an indestructible life Heb 8:10; 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>32.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Overcoming Life of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because Christ has overcome Satan and every negative thing in the universe, His life is an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we live by Christ, His life overcomes every negative thing for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>33.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Calling of the Overcomers</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Watchman Nee received revelation concerning the calling of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because the whole church has become defeated, failing to meet the Lord's purpose, the Lord has come in to call some of His believers to be overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is clearly revealed in the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the whole church has missed the mark, the Lord has sounded His call to those who love Him to overcome the degraded church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>34.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Spiritual Warfare</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By 1925 Watchman Nee had seen the matter of spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He saw that for the accomplishment of God's divine purpose in this universe, there is a consummate battle shaping up between God and His enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This battle involves all of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they take sides with Satan, they are rebelling against God; if they take sides with God, they are fighting against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the overcoming believers must realize that they are on the battlefield; they are fighting for God's divine purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To fight in this spiritual warfare requires the believer to see his heavenly position.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Ephesians 2 makes it clear that we are seated in the heavenly places, and Ephesians 6 indicates that we are fighting against the powers in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The believers must keep their heavenly position so that they can defeat God's enemies in the heavenly places.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the believers' position is on the earth, they are under the enemy, and they lose the position to overcome.</S>
