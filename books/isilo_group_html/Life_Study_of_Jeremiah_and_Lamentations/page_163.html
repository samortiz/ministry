Jehovah Bringing the Calamity of Esau<br>upon Edom When He Punishes Him</H2><P>Jehovah will bring the calamity of Esau upon Edom at the time when He punishes him. He will destroy the people of Edom, but He will preserve their orphans alive and let their widows trust in Him (Jer. 49:8-11). Even with such a people, God is very concerned for the widows and the orphans and desires that they, and all human beings, trust in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Bozrah Becoming a Waste,<br>a Reproach, a Ruin and a Curse</H2><P>Jeremiah 49:13 reveals that Bozrah, the capital of Edom, will become a waste, a reproach, a ruin and a curse. All her cities will become eternal desolations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehovah Making Edom Small<br>among the Nations, Despised among Men</H2><P>Jehovah has made Edom small among the nations, despised among men, because of the pride of her heart. She will become an astonishment, and people will hiss at all her wounds. No one will dwell there, nor will a son of man sojourn there, as when Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown (vv. 15-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E.

The Lord Jesus will come back first to Bozrah, and He will tread the great winepress from Bozrah to Armageddon, destroying Antichrist and all the evil armies of the world gathered there.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_162.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_164.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Jeremiah and Lamentations &nbsp; pg 163</div><br></body></html>
