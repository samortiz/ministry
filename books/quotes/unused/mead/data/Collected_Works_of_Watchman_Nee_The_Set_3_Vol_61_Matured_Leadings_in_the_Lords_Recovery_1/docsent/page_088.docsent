   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are still too few young brothers and sisters among us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of the children, relatives, and friends of our brothers and sisters are still not saved and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The brothers and sisters who serve as the nursing mothers should consider and think carefully before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have to pray to find out the way to help the young brothers and sisters around them and to provide them a place where they can speak and fellowship freely.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At least once a week they should lead these young ones to have a Bible study during the day or pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the young ones have some problems or some physical illnesses, these ones should help them solve their problems and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, all the nursing mothers should exercise much care over the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every house that is opened should provide the best care, and all the houses should help each other.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The thirteen sisters should get together more often to discuss and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They have to provide a place for the young people to go to and a place for them to speak up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>WORK IN THE DISTRICTS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The bread-breaking meeting will be conducted in five districts; they will meet in five homes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every district will be supervised by some responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have not assigned any other tasks to these brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they are encumbered by other tasks, they will be too busy to exercise supervision over others; they will not have the time to visit or to get into the situations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first work of the responsible ones is visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The main work of the church is visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we cannot take care of the visitation in a proper way, we will be like a man whose nervous system has broken down; there will be no communication.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are several kinds of visitations, including gospel visitation, new believers' visitation, and special visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE VISITATION WORK Gospel Visitation</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In gospel visitation we wrestle with Satan over men's souls; we try to snatch people out of Satan's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, whoever pulls harder wins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have five hundred people who have signed up after a gospel meeting, we are not doing them any good by merely "sending their names to heaven" without visiting them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is like going to someone's house and presenting a business card at the door without entering into the house at all.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What good does this do?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Satan is evil in many ways, but he has one virtue he is not slothful in zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we preach the gospel on the Lord's Day and a hundred people sign up and express their willingness to receive the Lord, we have to follow up with a second step.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to arrange for saints to visit them immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Within a week, we have to arrange for a hundred to two hundred brothers and sisters to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must not just invite people to come to the gospel meetings; we must send brothers to make personal calls to these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to surround them and gain them at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more gospel meetings we have, the more visitation work we need.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If visitation falls behind, our gospel will fail miserably.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The failure of the gospel mainly lies in the lack of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For the sake of efficiency, we will not centralize the arrangement of the visitation work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, every district will take care of its own visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The responsible brothers of each district will make proper arrangements for this work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The period of time when a man is about to escape Satan's grip is the most dangerous time for him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we visit him in that time and surround him, we will strengthen his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I believe that with the proper arrangement and the diligent visitation of the brothers and sisters, the number in the church will double in one to two months time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In one year our number can increase seven or eightfold.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Someone once said that the sea is full of fish and the earth is full of people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today two babies are born in China every five seconds.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May our gospel match the increase in our population.</S>
