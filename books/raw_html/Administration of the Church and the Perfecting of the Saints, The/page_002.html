<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT<br />
AND<br />
THE PROBLEM<br />
OF THE NATURAL CONSTITUTION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD CONFIRMING<br />
THE WAY OF THE CHURCH IN HISTORY</h2>
<p>The doctrine concerning the way of the church and concerning the ground of the church is clear to us. Furthermore, our experience in the past forty to fifty years proves that the way of the church and the ground of the church are right. Whether in Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Europe, or America, those among us who had problems with this way or this ground did not have a good ending.</p>
<p>I was saved in April of 1925. Less than three months after my salvation I came across articles written by Brother Nee. At that time, I was not yet twenty years old. Brother Nee was only two years older than I, but his articles were posted in a Christian publication called <em>The Morning Star.</em> Because of my love for the Lord and my appetite for spiritual books, I was attracted by Brother Nee&rsquo;s articles. I felt that his articles were unique. When he published <em>The Christian,</em> I wrote to him and inquired about spiritual matters. That was when we began corresponding. Seven years later, in 1932, I recommended Brother Nee to the denomination where I used to meet. Because they had a good impression of me, they accepted my recommendation and invited Brother Nee. I also wrote Brother Nee personally and requested that he come. That was the first time we met in person. From that meeting I realized that Brother Nee knew the truth. Brother Nee led me to touch the spirit and helped me to receive the life supply.</p>
<p>At that time, I was at a turning point in life and in the Lord. Later, the Lord raised up the church in Chefoo, which was the first church in northern China. In July of 1932 we started the bread-breaking meeting in my living room. From the very beginning this meeting was under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. We began with a few people, but by the summer of the following year our number had increased to nearly one hundred, so we rented a building for our meeting place.</p>
<p>In April of 1933 Brother Nee visited Chefoo again, and we had more fellowship. At the time, I had the sense that the Lord wanted me to drop my job and serve Him full time. This was a heavy burden. However, I had little experience concerning such matters. Brother Nee was experienced, but he did not touch the matter directly. Those who have had interactions with Brother Nee know that he preferred for people to receive leading from the Lord. In August, while I was struggling with the Lord concerning whether I should drop my job, Brother Nee wrote me a letter that said, &ldquo;Brother Witness, as for your future, I feel that you should serve the Lord with your full time. How do you feel? May the Lord lead you.&rdquo; That letter was a great encouragement to me. By the end of August I had quit my job, and in October I went to Shanghai and stayed with Brother Nee for about four months. From that time onward, I was clear that I was not following Brother Watchman Nee as a man; rather, I saw the Lord in him. I saw clearly that the way he was leading us to take was the way that the Lord desired. Therefore, I made the decision to take this way. After nearly half a century I have no regrets. I thank the Lord for keeping me in this way until now.</p>
<p>During the past fifty years, I have seen much. Some people had a good beginning and admired this way, but after a while they caused trouble with their opinions and then deviated from this way. I can testify that those who had problems with the church did not receive the blessing. Eventually, they came to a spiritual dead end. This is history, not a criticism.</p>
<p>Let us consider the history of the churches in Taiwan. Over the years since 1957, those who have left have lost the blessing. Those who took the Pentecostal way and those who proclaimed that they had seen the vision of the &ldquo;full&rdquo; Christ are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>In the United States many Christians who were zealous for the Lord were absolute when they came into the church. After a while, however, some of them had problems with the church and left. They were prominent men, eloquent speakers, and excellent writers, but they had no way to go on after they left, and they even realized this fact.</p>
<p>The law and principle of God in the universe are that He has only one way. The universe is monistic, not dualistic; everything is one. Hence, God ordained one husband and one wife. To have two husbands or two wives violates the law of God. The church is also monistic: one Body, one church. When the church is manifested in a locality, it is always one. Those who do not keep the principle of oneness will lose the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>The churches in Malaysia have existed for more than thirty years. Those who had a problem with the church or who were dissenting and left the church lost the blessing. The brothers in Indonesia can testify that those who are honest and orderly in the church enjoy both peace and blessing and that those who had a problem and left lost the blessing eventually. In particular, those who were ambitious and then left lost the blessing.</p>
<p>These experiences prove that God&rsquo;s way is one and that the ground is the ground of oneness. This does not mean that we are perfect or that we do everything well. We have to admit that we have our shortcomings and mistakes, but these mistakes reflect a problem with ourselves, not with the truth. This way is still the way of the Lord, and this ground is still the ground of the Lord, both of which are in the principle of oneness. We thank the Lord for keeping us by His mercy in this way in spite of our mistakes.</p>
<p>The Lord has blessed us because we walk on this way. More than fifty years ago Brother Watchman Nee had a burden to work for the Lord and began publishing literature. Although he was very young at the time, he was greatly used by the Lord. He was a young Chinese man, whom the Western missionaries disregarded, but he brought a tremendous blessing to China. I have not seen another person whose work was as blessed by the Lord as Brother Nee&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Afterward, we left mainland China and came to Taiwan. I came to Taiwan with my family of ten plus two servants, whom we could not dismiss. In all, twelve people were crowded into a house that was the size of sixteen straw mats. At that time, I was extremely disappointed and felt that there was nothing to do in Taiwan. One day as I was lying on the bed and staring at the ceiling, I asked myself what I was doing here. I was frustrated. Then the Lord said to me, &ldquo;Rise up and take a train from Taipei to Kaohsiung. Visit every place where there are brothers and sisters.&rdquo; Hence, I traveled to every place from the north to the south. When I returned, I told the brothers that we should begin the work because there was work to be done in Taiwan. In spite of the political tension, our only concern was to preach the gospel. We posted gospel banners at every major intersection, at bus stations and train stations, and on the streets. We printed gospel tracts according to the population of Taipei and distributed them to every house, and we held gospel marches to spread the gospel. Many elders and deacons were brought in through that preaching of the gospel. In six years&rsquo; time, from 1949 to 1955, our number increased from about four hundred to more than thirty thousand.</p>
<p>The denominations and missionaries in Taiwan opposed us, but they admitted that our work was the most effective and was blessed. However, they also spoke of &ldquo;a dead fly being in the fragrant ointment.&rdquo; The &ldquo;dead fly&rdquo; was a reference to the ground of the church: one church in one city. They could not accept this.</p>
<p>At the end of 1961 I made a third visit to the United States, and the Lord led me to stay there permanently. Brother Nee was a young student when he was raised up in China, but the Lord used him greatly. I was nearly sixty years old when I went to the United States. I am a Chinese who learned English when I was young and had never received an education in the United States. What could I do there? But the Lord poured out His blessing. Currently, there are more than seventy churches throughout the United States. Not only so, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery quickly spread from the United States to Europe, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and even Africa. The Lord&rsquo;s testimony is now on every continent.</p>
<p>My point is that we are not important figures, nor are we prominent people. We are nothing and nobody, but the Lord blesses His way. This way and this ground are of Him and are firm. Hence, the Lord has blessed us.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
