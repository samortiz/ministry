They think that it would be wonderful if they had been born two thousand years ago because they could have seen Jesus. But I tell such ones that I would not exchange places with Peter even if I could. Although I am quite insignificant, I can say humbly that I know much more than Peter. Peter only knew a Christ in the flesh. But I know the Lord who lives within me. When I was in Europe, I passed through the Mediterranean Sea and was approaching Egypt. A friend invited me to visit the holy land, but I declined the invitation. I asked myself, "Can a man increase his knowledge of Christ by visiting Golgotha, the garden of Gethsemane, or Sychar? No! Absolutely not!" That was why I declined to go. Paul said, "Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer" (2 Cor. 5:16). Today we do not know Christ according to the flesh or outward appearance, but according to spirit.</p><p>Romans 8 tells us clearly that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ have nothing to do with Christ (v. 9). Who are the sons of God? They are those who have become God's many sons through His unique begotten Son. God has neither female nor male offspring. We can be His sons today because we are in His Son. We become the many sons in His Son. All of God's children in the Bible are male. Second Corinthians 6:18 does say that God is our Father and that we are His sons and daughters. But this verse does not speak of our position in Christ. This is why it says "sons and daughters," not "sons." In Christ there is no male or female. In Christ we are all sons of God, and we have all received the life of God's Son. Hallelujah! The life of God's Son within us has made us His many sons. The life within the sisters is the same as the life within the brothers.</p><p>John 1:12 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name." Receiving refers specifically to receiving God's life; it does not refer to sinners receiving Christ as Savior for their salvation. Rather, it refers to sinners receiving God's life to become His children. This verse has been borrowed by many for a long time and has been misused for a long time. Tonight we have to claim it back.</p><p>Let us summarize what we have covered tonight. The blood and the cross deal with man as a sinner, whereas the flesh deals with man as a man. The Lord's blood deals with sin. This is before God and it is a vicarious work of the Lord. It is objective, and it is for cleansing, forgiveness, and justification. It deals with the negative things, and we receive it through believing. The cross deals with the old man. It is something done within man, and it is the Lord's identification work. It is subjective, and it is for removing and cutting off the flesh. It also deals with negative things, and it is accomplished through our believing. These two items remove all the barriers. Finally, the Lord's flesh deals with the person; it is for the dispensing of life. It is something done within man, through which the Lord releases His life. It is subjective, and it is for liberation, supply, sustenance, and reproduction. It is on the positive side, and we receive it also through believing. It is for the accomplishing of God's purpose. We must learn to thank and praise the Lord even more, because all of God's works have been accomplished. Tomorrow night we will talk about the way to receive Christ's life in a subjective way.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> </body></html>
