CONCERNING THE DELAY OF<br />
THE BUILDING OF HIS HOUSE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Jehovah&rsquo;s Rebuke</h2>
<p>In 1:2-6, 9-11 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s rebuke.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The People&rsquo;s Excuse</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Thus says Jehovah of hosts, saying, This people says, The time has not come, the time for the house of Jehovah to be built&rdquo; (v. 2). Here we have the people&rsquo;s excuse for delaying to rebuild the house of Jehovah. Their excuse was the time had not yet come for the house of Jehovah to be built.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Jehovah&rsquo;s Question</h2>
<p>The people&rsquo;s excuse is followed by Jehovah&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;Then the word of Jehovah came through Haggai the prophet, saying, Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled up houses, while this house lies waste?&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). They were taking care of their houses but not Jehovah&rsquo;s house, so He came in to ask them concerning His house.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah&rsquo;s Dealing with the Self-caring<br />
and God-neglecting Returned Captives</h2>
<p>In verses 5, 6, and 9 through 11 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the self-caring and God-neglecting returned captives.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Charging Them to Consider Their Ways</h2>
<p>In His dealing, the first thing Jehovah did was to charge the people to consider their ways (v. 5).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Telling Them That They Had Sown Much<br />
but Had Brought in Little</h2>
<p>Jehovah pointed out that the returned captives had sown much but had brought in little; that they had eaten and drunk but without satisfaction; that they had clothed themselves but without being warmed; and that they had earned wages to put them into a bag with holes (v. 6). This tells us that if we do not have the heart to take care of God&rsquo;s house for His satisfaction, no matter how much we eat or drink or how well we dress ourselves, there will be no satisfaction. If we neglect the church, we will have no real enjoyment or satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Saying That They Looked for Much<br />
and It Amounted to Little</h2>
<p>In verse 9 Jehovah went on to say that they looked for much, and it amounted to little. When they brought it home, He blew on it because of His house which lay waste, and they each ran to their own house. Therefore, over them the heavens withheld their dew, and the earth withheld its yield (v. 10). Indeed, Jehovah had called for a drought upon the land, upon the mountains, upon the grain, upon the new wine, upon the fresh oil, upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon man, beast, and all the toil of the hands (v. 11).</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;run&rdquo; in verse 9 indicates that the people were busy caring for their own houses. Today some saints are so busy caring for their own houses that they have no time to attend the meetings. As we consider this, we need to realize that in the entire universe there is no such thing as neutrality. We must be absolute. We must either take care of our houses first or take care of the Lord&rsquo;s house first. My point here is that we need to learn to save some time for the Lord&rsquo;s interests. How many sinners are waiting for our visitation? How many saints, especially younger ones, are waiting for our cherishing and nourishing? We may excuse ourselves today, but we need to consider how we will answer the Lord Jesus when He comes. We may have many relatives who are unsaved. Their being unsaved may be our fault, not theirs. If so, when the Lord comes to settle accounts with us (Matt. 25:19), He will surely rebuke us. It has been difficult for us to get the increase, not mainly because of our environment but because of our excuses.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah&rsquo;s Charge</h2>
<p>In His charge Jehovah told the people to consider their ways and to go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house, and He would take pleasure in it and would be glorified (Hag. 1:7-8). Today our gospel preaching is our gathering of material for the building of God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The People&rsquo;s Response</h2>
<p>Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the high priest and all the remnant of the people responded to Jehovah by listening to the voice of Jehovah their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet, and they were in fear before Jehovah (v. 12). Then Haggai, Jehovah&rsquo;s messenger, encouraged the people with Jehovah&rsquo;s declaration, &ldquo;I am with you&rdquo; (v. 13). Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the spirit of Joshua, and the spirit of all the people, and they came and did work in the house of Jehovah of hosts (vv. 14-15). What a wonderful response!</p>
<p>I hope that all the dear saints will be busy in going out to visit people and in contacting their relatives, classmates, and colleagues for the gospel. All the saints should be occupied by the Lord Jesus in preaching the gospel, feeding the new believers, and taking care of others. I hope that concerning this the whole atmosphere and environment among us will be revolutionized.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> </body></html>
