   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Memory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"But the Comforter...will...remind you of all the things which I have said to you" John 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The believer does not realize that the meaning of this word is that the Holy Spirit will enlighten his mind to cause him to remember the Lord's words.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He assumes it means that he does not need to use his memory anymore and that God will make him remember everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result of this, the believer allows his memory to lapse into passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He no longer exercises his will to use his memory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The consequences are: 1 the believer does not exercise his will to use his memory; 2 God does not use it either, because there is no one to cooperate with Him; and 3 evil spirits come in and display everything that is expedient for themselves in front of him, so that he cannot refuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His will becomes passive so that he has no way to control his memory anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>D. Love</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit" Rom 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Believers misunderstand this verse to mean that they do not have to love and that the Holy Spirit will give them God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They ask God to love through them and supply them fully with His love so that they can be full of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They no longer love; rather, they want God to make them love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They no longer use their loving ability, and they allow their loving function to fall into a cold numbness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The results are: 1 the believers themselves do not love; 2 God will not negate man or the natural function of his love; He will not give man a supernatural love; and 3 evil spirits will live on behalf of man and express their love and hatred according to their will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Evil spirits are allowed to give him a substitute for love because he is so passive and does not use his will to control his loving function.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, the believer will become like a piece of wood and stone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He will feel cold toward everything and will not know what love is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the reason so many believers are hard and unapproachable even though they may be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus says, "You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength" Mark 12:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whose love is this?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whose heart, whose soul, whose mind, and whose strength are these?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, they are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our natural life should die, but all these functions of ours should remain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>E. Humility</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with any of those who commend themselves" 2 Cor 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because a believer misunderstands the meaning of humility, he thinks that he should hide himself in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a result, the proper self-esteem that God allows is not there anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Much of self-abasement is just another form of passivity and possession.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The results are: 1 the believer denies himself; 2 God does not fill him; and 3 evil spirits take advantage of his passivity to keep him further in this state of "humility."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When a believer is very possessed and self-abased, his surroundings seem to become all darkness, despair, and weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who are in contact with him sense a kind of coldness, depression, and sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At crucial moments, he will retreat and cause embarrassment to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's work bears no importance to him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Both in words and deeds, he pays particular attention to hide the "I."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But while he acts this way, his "I," to the contrary, is all the more exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, it becomes a real frustration to those who are truly spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When great needs arise in God's kingdom, his extreme self-abasement will not allow him to lift so much as a finger.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A sense of prolonged inability, hopelessness, impossibility, and sensitivity is manifested in him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The believer thinks that this is true humility, in which one does not consider himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Little does he realize that this is the result of evil spirits' work of overt introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>True humility looks to God and progresses forward.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>GOD'S ORDERING</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this world, in addition to man's will, two other wills are entirely opposite to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God not only wants us to obey Him; He also wants us to withstand Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, God puts these two matters together two times in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>James 4:7a says, "Be subject therefore to God," and 4:7b says, "Withstand the devil."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First Peter 5:6-9 says, "Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God...Your adversary, the devil...Him withstand, being firm in your faith."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is balance in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A believer should submit himself to God in everything he encounters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He should confess that God's ordering for him is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Though he suffers, he willingly obeys because this is the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is what we have spoken of in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is half of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The apostles knew that we are in danger of being biased, so they immediately said that we have to withstand the devil after we submit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The reason for this is that in addition to God's will, there is also the devil's will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times he counterfeits God's will, particularly in our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are misled to think that there is only God's will in this world, we will be deceived by the devil and take his will as God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, God wants us to obey Him and, at the same time, withstand the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To withstand is a work of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To withstand is for the will to oppose, to be unwilling, to decline, and to disagree.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God wants us to use our will.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is why He says, "Withstand."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God will not withstand on our behalf; we ourselves have to withstand.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We still have a will, and we still should use our will to obey God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But the believer misunderstands and supposes that God's will is manifested in His arrangement of the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To him, everything that comes upon him is fully God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Consequently, there is no need for his will to have any further selection, consideration, determination, resistance, or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He merely accepts everything in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This sounds good and right.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But unavoidably, there can be misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is true that we acknowledge God's hand behind everything.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We also know that we should fully submit under God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But this is more a matter of attitude than a matter of conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If whatever befalls us is God's commanded will, do we have anything to say?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is a matter of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we become willing to obey God, we can further examine and ask: Are these matters from evil spirits?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Or are they permitted by God?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If they are ordained by God, we have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But if they are not, we should work with God to withstand them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should not submit to every circumstance without daily examining and testing it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our attitude should be the same all the time, but our practice should be carried out only after we understand the circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Otherwise, we may be obeying the devil's will.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Believers should not be people without a mind.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They should not be entirely passive and controlled by the circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Rather, whenever they encounter anything, they should always vigorously, actively, and consciously examine its source, test its nature, understand its content, and then decide on a course of action.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Being submissive to God is important, but this does not mean blind submission.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A vigorous investigation does not mean that we can disobey God in our circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Rather, it means that we have the intention to submit to God, but we want to know if it is God that we are submitting to.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Today few believers are submissive in their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This means that even if they know something is of God, few will submit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Yet when they have been broken by God, they still do not discern if a matter is from God; as long as something comes to them, they accept it without any question.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The balanced truth is to be submissive in attitude yet, at the same time, to accept something only after one is clear about its source.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Many fully consecrated believers do not understand this difference.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They just passively submit to the circumstance, assuming that everything is God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This gives evil spirits the opportunity to utilize and afflict them.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Evil spirits prepare the circumstances as traps in order to cause the believers to accomplish their will.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They may stir up storms and may cause the believers to be afflicted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In this way, they make believers suffer the sin of others, while considering this to be an example of not resisting "him who is evil" Matt 5:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Little do they realize that God also wants them to be "struggling against sin" Heb 12:4 , to overcome the spirit of this age through overcoming the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The results of such a practice are: 1 they no longer use their will to choose and decide; 2 God will not pressure them through their environment; and 3 evil spirits will utilize the circumstance to take over their passive will.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Then the believers will be submitting to evil spirits and think that they are submitting to God.</S>
