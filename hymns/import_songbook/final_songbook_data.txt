Zion is God’s habitation.                     
Sing praises in Zion,                     
The city of our King.
Zion, the place of His choosing                     
Where saints are rejoicing.
Here God is their salvation.

c
Beautiful Zion, in elevation,
The joy of our King,
His satisfaction,
The joy of the whole earth

2
Zion: how good and how pleasant,
The greatest enjoyment!
It’s like the precious ointment.
Zion, how good and how pleasant,
In oneness we’re dwelling.
The dew, oh how refreshing!

c2
Beautiful Zion, in elevation
How good and how pleasant,
The best enjoyment!
Our oneness is just Him.

3
Zion: our Oneness a Person,
As ointment, He’s moving,
As dew He is descending.
Zion: our God is our dwelling,
As ointment, He’s strengthening,
As dew, He’s so supplying.

c3
Beautiful Zion, in elevation
How good and how pleasant,
Man’s satisfaction,
Our dwelling is this One.

Zion: in God we’re abiding,
Our oneness and living,
The processed God, our all.
Zion, the ultimate blessing,
Of God with man mingling,
The Triune God dispensing.

c4
Beautiful churches, the golden lampstands
God mingling with man
His satisfaction,
The ultimate consummation!

Tune: "I'm gonna praise God unceasingly"

1
We see a picture of the Triune God                     
In Revelation one—
The lampstands golden
Shining so brightly;
God the Father’s seen in the gold,
The form shows us the Son,
Shining Spirit is seven yet one.                     

c
Now in our spirit we can see,
Triune God is all we need,
Mingling with us to produce His many sons.                     
Shining forth with God eternally,
In the New Jerusalem we
Will express the Triune God forevermore.                     

2
Another picture in John fifteen—
A long green vine we see,
With branches fruitfully
Flowing out the Spirit; we
Are all well-tended by the husbandman,
Grafted into Christ the Son,
Abiding in the Triune God.

3
The ultimate consummation—
The New Jerusalem,
A corporate entity,
Shining God in eternity.
City’s gold, pearl, and precious stone,
Work of Father, Spirit, Son;
With Him we’re forever one.

Let’s talk about Jesus-
The King of kings is He
The Lord of lords supreme                     
Through all eternity,
The great I Am, the Way,
The Truth, the Light, the Door-
Let’s talk about Jesus more and more!

Saving us, keeping us from all sin and shame-
Wonderful is our Redeemer - Praise His name!

Praise the Lord!

s
And this is why I am so happy!
And this is why I am so free.
I’m drinking at the springs of living water—
Oh, won’t you come and have-
Oh, won’t you come and have-
Oh... won’t you come and have a drink with me!

Of those who were praising the Lord.
Some were singing,
Some were praying,
But they all were praising the Lord.

O we will praise,
O we will always praise the Lord!
O we will praise,
O we will praise,
O we will always praise the Lord!

When I’ve run the race before me
And have fought to victory,
I’ll be raptured to the glory of the Lord;
When I’ve kept the faith at any cost,
The Holy City then
I’ll receive as my reward.                     

c
I’ll be raptured into glory,
In the Holy City dwell—
New Jerusalem, New Jerusalem;                     
With the overcomers shouting,
How our praises then will swell,
In the New Jerusalem.                     

2
As a pilgrim here I wander;
While afflicted, I rejoice,
For a better land I soon expect to see;
Though all others seek for earthly gain,
The Holy City e’er
Will my aspiration be.

3
Though my feet are often wearied
On the rough and rugged path,
Just by thinking of that city, I’m restored;
Though my eyes be filled with tears,
My heart will evermore be fixed
On that City, my reward.

4
With strong purpose I now wrestle,
And I run toward the goal;
I pursue the prize, God’s highest to obtain;
Pressing forward toward the mark,
I run forgetting all behind,
Thus the Holy City gain.

c2
By His love and through His grace I’ll
In the Holy City live—
New Jerusalem, New Jerusalem;
All saints leaping, singing, shouting,
To the Lord their praises give,
In the New Jerusalem.

Peter and John went to pray.
They met a lame man on the way.
He asked them for silver and gold and alms
and this is what they had to say :

2
Silver and gold have I none,
But such as I have give I thee;
In the name of Jesus Christ
Of Nazareth, Rise up and walk.
He went walking, and leaping, and praising God,
Walking, and leaping, and praising God.
In the name of Jesus Christ
Of Nazareth, Rise up and walk.

3
Silver and gold have I none,
But the Seven-fold Spirit have I;
In the Name of Jesus Christ
I’ll stand up and testify.
I’ll praise Him and testify in the church,
Praise Him and testify in the church.
In the Name of Jesus Christ
I’ll stand up and testify.

Make a joyful noise unto the Lord,
All ye, all ye lands.
Serve the Lord, the Lord with gladness,
Come before His presence with singing.

2
Know ye that the Lord He is God;
It is He that hath made us,
And not we ourselves;
We are His people and the sheep
of His pasture.

3
Enter into His gates
with thanksgiving
And into His courts with praise;
Be thankful unto Him,
And bless, and bless His name.

4
For the Lord, the Lord He is good;
His mercy is everlasting;
And His truth endureth to all,
Endureth to all generations.

Hallelujah! Glory hallelujah!

Hallelujah! Glory hallelujah!

All heaven declares
The glory of the risen Lord
Who can compare
With the beauty of the Lord?

c
Forever He will be                     
The Lamb upon the throne.
I gladly bow my knee                     
And worship Him alone.                     

2
I will proclaim
The glory of the risen Lord.
Who once was slain
To reconcile man to God.

As the Spirit leading constantly!

Christ has come to be life—
the processed Divine Trinity                     
God the Father’s the source—
a Fountain emerging to be
God the Son as a gushing-up spring
In the Spirit, a river, for life-imparting.
Oh! How can this miracle be?
The Triune God flowing in me?
Oh!  I’ve got rivers of life
flowing out of my innermost being!
I’ve got rivers of life
flowing out of my innermost being!

c1
As this life flows through me,
I’m supplied abundantly
His life nullifies sin;
Pow’r springs now from within
To be free—overcoming spontaneously!                     

2
Yet this life, though it frees,
is not meant for mere victory
God is full of intent,
and never could flow aimlessly.
So this life has a totality,
A consummate issue encompassing me,
Life moves and life grows, life shapes as it flows,
Now I share in this life’s destiny,
Oh! I’ve got rivers of life
flowing out of my innermost being!
I’ve got rivers of life
flowing out of my innermost being!

c2
We’ll abide mutually
God and man revealed to be
Lamb, Wife, Spirit and Bride!
Come, drink! And riverside
Grows the tree, our enjoyment for eternity!

3
So I’ve no cause to frown,
As one who received this zoe.
I know life runs its course,
and triumphs inevitably.
I’m required just to stay in the flow.
If I do the drinking then God gives the growth!
So there’s joy in my heart, and a spring in my step,
And a smile on my face as I sing,
Oh! I’ve got rivers of life
flowing out of my innermost being!
I’ve got rivers of life
flowing out of my innermost being!

Breathing in the Lord
Is how we live today.
Not by thinking do we live,
But breathing is the way.
We just call “O Lord!”
From very deep within,
And with joy we testify
We’re breathing in of Him.

c
Breathe in Christ,
Breathe in Life,
Breathe Him in today!
He’s our very life supply,
So breathe Him right away! (Repeat)

2
He’s so wonderful,
The Breath of Life is He;
Once he simply was a man,
But now He’s breath to me.
He has changed His form;
The Spirit now is He.
He’s the Christ breathed out from God,
The Breath breathed in by me.

c2
Everywhere, everywhere,
Christ is life to me;
I just call upon His name,
And breath comes into me! (Repeat)

There’s a life that’s deeper than our mind,
With experience of man, yet so divine.                     
It’s a life that knows no bounds;
And with glory is crowned;
It’s of depth and height and breadth unsearchable.
Now this life is just the Living One
Manifested in the Person of the Son.                     
As the Spirit, He flows;
In our spirit He grows,
Growing up to be the church that He desires.

c
O Lord, we’re just for Your flowing;
How we need a deeper knowing!
Life is why we’re here
And why You’ve come in us.                     
Turn us, Lord, turn us now;
Turn us deeply—Life is how
You will get the church,
The home You’re longing for.

2
In the church, we all can apprehend
All the riches of this life that is within.
Not just shallowness with strife,
But a deep and peaceful life
Is just waiting to flow out, a living spring.
With the saints it’s easy to be bold,
To pursue this life, to gain it, to lay hold.
All the other things we find,
Must be quickly left behind,
So that only life remains for us to see.

3
Deeper, Lord our turn must be to You;
We would move by life in everything we do;
All our concepts refute,
For Your life be absolute—
Grant us grace to turn much deeper day by day.
When we touch our spirit—such a thrill!
This is far beyond emotion, mind, and will—
It’s within our hidden part—
Come, make home in all our heart;
Let Your presence flow as rivers deep within.

Now the Lord is the Spirit—that’s how                     
He can get inside of you right now.
It’s so easy to be filled with Him.                     
He’s made it really simple.
One, two, three—                     
That’s how easy it can be.

c
O Lord! Amen!
That’s the way to let Him in.                     
Hallelujah! I love to hear it.
He who is joined to the Lord
Is one spirit.                     

2
Now the Lord is the living air;
You can breathe Him in anywhere—
Anytime of day, whenever you please.
He’s made it really easy.
O Lord! Amen!
Let’s sing it again.

3
Now the Lord lives inside of me.
And He’s filling me constantly.
Yes, He’s filling up every gap.
He makes me really happy.
I’m so happy!
Hallelujah! Taste and see!

From my spirit, when I’m sensing the supply
Of God’s speaking, from a fount that ne’er runs dry,
And within me comes a fresh and sweet supply,
Then I’ve got to open up and water you.                     

c
Water you, water you
From the flowing in my spirit water you;                     
When the saints need my supply,
Then I’ll surely testify,
I’ll stand up, release my Christ and water you!

2
In the meeting, when the spirit’s rising high,
And it seems like we will go beyond the sky—
I can’t help it, I must speak or else I’ll die,
For my Christ is rising up to water you.

3
Should a pause come, or the meeting ebb real low,
While within me there’s a rich and living flow,
Then I’ll stand up, so that all the saints will know,
That I’m here to share my Christ and water you.

4
In the church life, in our daily living too,
In the meeting, and in everything we do,
Christ is speaking and the Spirit’s breaking through,
That is why there’s the supply to water you.

Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit;
Now Christ is the Spirit today.                     
Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit;
So turn to your spirit and say—                     

c
O Lord, Amen
O Lord, Amen, Hallelu-jah!
O Lord, Amen,
O Lord, Amen, Hallelu-jah!

2
Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit;
Now Christ is the living Word too.
The Spirit will flow in our spirit,
The Word will be life to us through—

c2
Praying, reading,
Praising and calling upon His name;
Praying, reading,
Praising and calling upon Him.

Tune: "There are three kinds of life"

1
It’s a new, living meeting that we’re having today.
We are meeting in spirit and we worship this way.
We enjoy the reality of Christ as all,
And leave all of the shadows when on Jesus we call.

c
It’s a new, living meeting
In a new, living way.
At the beaches, the schools, the parks—
wherever we may.
We are slaying the ord’nances, religion too.
Hallelujah!  The Spirit of the Lord’s
breaking through.

2
We don’t care for religion, we don’t care for the forms,
We don’t care for opinions, regulations or norms.
We don’t care for the doctrines that will kill us dead—
Hallelujah! We’re free in our spirit instead.

3
It’s a new, living meeting, no more oldness we’ll bear.
In the singing, pray-reading it is Christ that we share.
No more old-fashioned meeting in the old, old way.
Hallelujah! The Lord is doing new things today!

Turn to your spirit in the middle of everything.
Turn to the Lord. Oh, turn to the Lord!

Turn to your spirit—where life is really found.
Turn to your spirit if you’re up or if you’re down,
Turn to the Lord. Oh, turn to the Lord!

Turn to your spirit, calling upon His name—

Have you found your human spirit?
It’s connected to your mouth!
“Hallelujah—O Lord Jesus!”
That’s the way to let it out!                     

c
What is born of God is our human spirit—
Praise God, the job has been done!                     
What is born of Spirit is just our spirit,
And the two spirits are one.                     

2
Don’t wait for an inspiration—
That’s the subtle enemy.
Open up! Release your spirit,
Testifying you are free.

Drop by drop
The Lord will get inside of you.
Drop by drop
In emotion, mind and will.
Drop by drop
The vessel that the Lord has made
He will gladly fill.                     

c
There is oil in your lamp but there’s the vessel too;
Is it filled with Christ or just filled with you?

The spirit of the prophet
Is subject to the prophet;
The word declares it so.

My spirit is ready to go.
I don’t have to live according to my feelings,
Or wait for a better day.
I can turn, I can call, “Lord Jesus!”

How could a country girl like me
Become Your match—Your bride to be?
You’re holy and You are divine
But I’m fallen and human.

2
Without You Lord I have no chance
To be like You in this romance
But You chose me ere the world began
Nothing could change Your plan.

c
This divine romance
Is My heart’s deep plan
I became a lowly man
To court My country girl.

c
Nothing could deter.
Nothing can alter
My eternal love for her
I’ll gain My country girl.

3
No man or angel ever knew
This secret hidden deep in You
That You desired to be one with man
Before the world began.

4
Though sin came in to ruin me
Through Satan’s scheme and subtlety
Nothing could break Your love for me
To gain me totally.

I:(Chorus 1)    

5
As King of kings You became a man
You died for me—I’ve been redeemed
In resurrection made us queen
To marry You my King.

From death You ’rose and entered me
I now possess Your divinity
In life and nature we’re the same:
Both human and divine.

c2
In Your love I’m drawn
To You I belong
I am not my own, Lord
I’m Yours alone.

c2
By Your love I’m drawn
In Your name I’m charmed
And Your Person captured me
For I’ve been kissed by Thee.

7
Lord, in this close, sweet fellowship
Lord be with me so intimate
So personal and affectionate
A sweet relationship.

Lord, daily change my inward being
Lord, all my heart possessing
In all my being—transforming
To be Your bride and queen.

I:(Chorus 2)

Lord, You are so dear
How could my heart desire
Anything that’s less than You?
Lord, You are the One I must choose
Lord, I love You.

Lord, I love You more today
Than any other
Lord, I love You more right now

Lord, You are so near
Be everything to me
I couldn’t live a day without You
I’m totally dependent on You
Lord, I need You.

I’ll never let You go
Lord, I love You
I want You to know
Lord, I love You so.

Let me stand behind You, Lord.
Let me wash Your feet with my tears.
Let me wipe them with my hair.
Let me kiss them and anoint them with the ointment.

c
I love You!
Jesus, I love You!
May I waste my all and life on You.
Let me pour the ointment pure
On Your head and on Your feet,
On You, most precious One
Because I love You.

2
Let me take a pound of ointment pure
Of great value to anoint Your feet
And wipe them with my hair
That the house be filled with the fragrance
of the ointment.

I:(Chorus 1)    

3
Lord, they said if You were a prophet,
You should know who and what I am.
I’m a sinner that toucheth You.
A woman not worthy to anoint You.

c2
But I love You!
Jesus, I love You!
You forgave me the most
now I love You, Lord, the most.
Let me pour the ointment pure
On Your head and on Your feet,
On You, most precious One,
Because You love me.

4
Let my love from my being wash Your feet
To my glory without wipe them too
Let me kiss them where the nails would pierce.
All my love, Lord, and glory I’ll waste on You.

c3
I love You!
Jesus, I love You!
All my glory and love I pour
and waste on You.
Receive my ointment, Lord.
It’s all I have, dear Lord.
For You, most precious One,
Because I love You.

When I first fell in love with Jesus,
I gave Him all my heart.
And I thought I couldn’t love Him more,
Than I did right at the start.
Now I look back over the mountains,
And the valleys where we’ve been.
And it makes me know I love Him so,
Much more; than I did then.

c
I keep fallin’ in love with Him,
Over and over and over and over again.
I keep fallin’ in love with Him,
He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by.
Oh, what a love between my Lord and I.
I keep fallin’ in love with Him,
Over and over and over and over again.

2
There’s a hand that I hold on to,
Thru each valley and each trial.
There’s a shoulder that I lean upon,
As I face another mile.
There’s a love I can depend on,
It’s fresh and new each day.
And with joy my heart is overflowing,
So this is why I say


Calgary Songbook :1708

1
Morning dawn had arisen,
Abraham saddled his donkey,
Took his two young men with him
And Isaac, his beloved son.

c
Lord, You’re God’s only Son
And of God begotten
“This is My beloved Son, in whom
I am well-pleased.”

2
To his young men he said then,
“Stay and we’ll return to you.”
To Moriah he led him,
His son Isaac, just them two.

c2
Just the son and the father,
Speaking with one another.
Isaac said, “My father!” Abraham
said, “Here I am.”

3
As You spoke with Your Father
You bore the wood God laid on You;
As a lamb to the slaughter
Obedient to the death were You.

c3
Precious blood of a Lamb,
Slain before earth began,
Laid Your life down for Your sheep, in love,
That I might live.

4
Man of sorrows, I love You.
From You men did hide their face.
With no majesty to You,
Despised, forsaken, and disgraced.

c4
For my sins You were crushed.
Lord, I love You so much.
Chastened, scourged and then pierced through, my griefs
and sorrows bore.

5
Dead in sins and offenses,
I’m a bruised reed—smoking flax.
Yet to death You were given,
For of Your sheep, You’d not lose one.

c5
Like the woman, I’d weep,
Flow my tears at Your feet.
Jesus Lord, I just love You—dear Lord,
Jesus my Lord.


Calgary Songbook :1709

1
God is love, who sent His beloved Son.
Man is fallen with corruption,
But You sent Your dear Son.
God commends His kindness and love towards us,
In that while we were yet sinners
Christ died for us.

c
God, You did not spare Him,
Your beloved Son.
Father, how we praise You
For this precious One!

2
Who can know the love from our Father’s being?
Ears have never heard; eyes have never seen,
But Lord, I’ve been redeemed.
God is love. O God, a man You became;
A cursed man to be, God, You died for me.
Lord, You hung from a tree.

c2
Father, You have sent Him,
Your beloved Son.
He shed His blood on Calvary.
Your love reached me.

3
God so loved the world that He gave us His Son.
Just believe in Him. Be not perishing,
But have eternal life.
Just believe in Him. Be not perishing,
But have eternal life.

I do not know where they have laid Him.
The stone is taken away from the tomb.
Oh! They have taken Him away!
Oh, where is He?

2
Disciples came and saw the empty tomb,
But went away so soon to their own homes.
They’re satisfied with just the facts,
But where’s my Lord?

c
Where is He, my Jesus?
Where is He, my Beloved?
Where is He whom my soul doth love?
Jesus, my love, I just want You.

3
My heart is broken from my deepest need.
Don’t ask me, angels, why I’m weeping.
Nothing but Jesus fills my inner being.
Oh, where’s my love?

4
Someone is standing right behind me—
It’s just the gardener; I can barely see.
Sir, if you carried Him away,
Oh! Where is He?

c2
Where is He, my Jesus?
Where is He, my Beloved?
Tell me where you have laid Him
And I’ll carry Him away; I’ll carry Him away.

5
And then I heard a voice say, “Mary,”
That sweetest voice that penetrated me.
It is the voice of my Beloved,
Jesus, my love.

c3
I have found my Jesus!
I have found my Beloved!
I have found whom my soul doth love,
Jesus, my love, I just love You!

6
But Jesus told me not to touch Him yet;
He must ascend first to the Father,
“And to My Father and your Father,
To My God and your God.

c4
Go and tell My brothers,
I ascend to the Father,
To My Father and your Father,
And My God and your God; go tell My brothers.”

The love of Christ is now constraining me
That I would love and love Him utterly.
His mighty love has touched me deep within
To consecrate my life and all to Him.

c
This charming One so excelling,
To His touch I’m now responding,
To surrender, to surrender to Him.                     

2
This tide of love has flowed to me from Him;
Unchanging love that keeps on rushing in.
Now I’m for Him beyond my own control;
He is now my love and my only goal.

c2
His dying love so compelling,
And this tide has made me willing
To love Him; I can’t help but love Him.

3
The love of Christ
Is now constraining me to love Him utterly.
His mighty love
Has touched me deep within to consecrate to Him.

I:(Chorus 1)

Has flowed to me from Him that keeps on rushing in.
Now I’m for Him
Beyond my own control, He’s now my final goal.

Lord, I love You.
Lord, I need You.
Lord, without You
Nothing would be the same.
Without You knowing
Without You flowing
Without You growing
In me my life is vain.

c
Lord, I love You more and more;
I just want You.
Fill me with your life and Your virtues.
Fill me ’til I’m only living You.
Fill me every minute, every hour, every day
Until I am expressing you always.                     
Fill this earthen vessel, Lord, I pray.                     

2
Lord, You’re moving,
Operating.
In my being
Saturate every part.
You’re infusing,
Permeating.
You’re indwelling,
Making home in my heart.

I:(Chorus 1)    

3
Lord You’re building
Your expression;
Lord, by mingling
All that You are in me
I’m responding,
Cooperating,
Consecrating
Myself to You totally.

c2
Lord, for Your expression
I would now outpour,
Partaking of Your Person more and more
I would now outpour.
This is what I was created for,
This is what I was created for.

Lord Jesus, You’re lovely.
You’re more to be desired,
Than any earthly pleasure.
You’re fine, beyond compare.
Lord Jesus, Your beauty
Does far exceed all others.
You’re comely and You’re tender.
You’re radiant and You’re fair.

2
When I behold You Jesus,
You draw my heart completely.
I cannot turn away Lord,
I rest in Your embrace;
And time is gone there’s only
Your holy, matchless presence
Abiding in You, gazing
Upon Your glorious face.

3
I give my life to You Lord,
For You alone are worthy.
There’s nothing and there’s no one
That I desire but You.
May all my days be Yours, Lord,
My heart be given to love You,
To treasure and to serve You
By Your sufficient grace.

There is a great mystery,
A wonderful story;
For ages ’twas hidden,
Now shown in His wisdom;
’Tis a divine romance
Of God and man in time;
Beyond understanding,
Yet seen in God’s speaking.                     

c
God fell in love with man;
For only God’s love can
Make man just the same as He
In life and in nature,                     
We are His expression,
His bride, His enlargement;
Forever, together,
As living, insep’rable as one couple
Eternally.

2
Though He was rejected
By men who were blinded;
His love is constraining,
His heart still unchanging;
Thus in incarnation
Came He as salvation;
His name is called Jesus,
And He came to seek us.

3
Though I’ve been a sinner,
I now have been redeemed
By Christ who died for me,
Who was raised in glory.
I am joined to Him now,
Together we’re living;
I love to enjoy Him,
For I’ve been forgiven.

4
His love is so tender,
To Him I’ll surrender;
His name is so precious,
I’ll gladly call, “Jesus!”
His Person’s so charming,
My heart ever winning;
I’ll hold back no longer,
I’ll love Him forever.

Your sweetness is just the taste of enjoyment
Your beauty is simply my heart’s attraction                     
Your radiance has captured me.
Your eyes draw things out of me.
I want to daily kiss You and hold on to You.

c
O Jesus, I’m crazy loving You.
O Jesus, I’m crazy loving You.
O Jesus, I’m crazy loving You, ’til myself is no more.
O Jesus, I’m crazy loving You.
O Jesus, I’m crazy loving You.
O Jesus, I’m crazy loving You, ’til I’m lost in You.

2
Forgetting all that I’m outwardly doing.
Forgetting all of my thoughts of improving.
You only want to be loved. I give my love unto You.
A crazy lover of Christ, I’m jumping for joy.

3
Yes, my life’s just to love You with my whole being.
Yes, my work’s just to love You with my whole being.
Loving You is my pleasure.  Loving You is my service.
Loving You is my motive and also my will.

4
O, My Love, You’ve blinded me towards all things.
O, My Love, You make the world simply nothing.
Just let me see You alone.  Just make me need You alone.
None other is there for me, it’s Jesus alone.

Wash me and cleanse me with Your blood
So You can speak to me.

Be so real to me.
You are all I want;
I open wide to Thee.

Open my eyes that I might see
All that You are to me.

Never from You would I depart,
Loving You constantly.

Flood me thoroughly;
Take my willing heart
And overcome in me.

Lord, I want You to have Your way,
Save me from being Satan’s prey;
I am believing You.
All I can give to You, my Lord,
Is my whole being, love outpoured;
Lord, I belong to You.

Jesus, faithful God,
Gain us through and through;
Use us thoroughly
To see Your purpose through.

God wants someone to love Him,
Not just someone to serve Him;
He wants someone to love Him —
As His bride.
God wants someone to match Him,
Not just to imitate Him;
He wants a counterpart.
One from His side.

c
For this He came down to us;                     
He came to court, to woo us,                     
Away from everything, and —
Unto Him.
Now we’re espoused unto Him,                     
Pledged and betrothed unto Him;                     
Yes, we are bound unto Him
By His love.

2
God wants someone to love Him,
Not just someone to fear Him;
He wants a sweetheart who will —
Be His bride.
God wants someone to know Him,
Not just to know about Him;
He wants someone who’ll look Him
In the eye.

Lord Jesus, I love You.
You’re my all —

Real peace and joy I never knew,
Until in spirit I touched You, so—

Lord, I just open up to You;
I let You do what You want to do.
Lord, I just give myself to You,
’Cause I love You—Lord, I do.

2
You save me all day long;
Though I’m weak,

The flow of life and peace
Within me shows the way,
Hour by hour, day by day;
And if through weakness I should fall,
You always save me when I call, so—

I:(Repeat Chorus)

O Lord, one touch with Thee
Brought life into me.
And now I can’t live without You.

With a love that constrains me
Till I say that—

Lord, take my life                     
I give it, Lord, to You.
You have opened my eyes, Lord,
And turned me to You.
You are my Creator, O Lord,
How I love You.
You are also my Savior
And everything that’s true.                     

1
Lord, so often I’m like Thomas
Who would not receive:
“Unless I see Your face, Lord, I would not believe...”
But then You would appear...
“My Lord and my God”
Saying, Blessed are they who see not, yet believe.

2
I have someone deep within me
Welling up in me each day.
Even though I have not seen Him in such an outward way—
“Whom having not seen, I love,
I love, oh so much.
And by having His life, yes, I believe.”

I:(Chorus)    

3
Day by day I look forward
to that time I spend with You.
Just as Mary poured her love out, O Lord, I would too.
Grant me, Lord, a heart
that’s single and true.
And a daily life that’s living just by You.

4
So when daily I see trials
and tribulations sore,
May I put my trust in You, Lord, “For Christ has gone before”
And open to Your living Word,
receiving faith—
Reach me, Lord, with Your mercy and Your grace.

I:(Chorus)

I have a friend so precious,
So very dear to me;
He loves me with such tender love,
His love’s so fair and sweet;
I could not live apart from Him,
I love to feel Him nigh;                     
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.

2
Sometimes I’m faint and weary,
He knows that I am weak;
And as He bids me lean on Him,
His help I gladly seek;
He leads me in the paths of light,
Beneath a sunny sky;
And so we walk together,
My Lord and I.

3
He knows how much I love Him,
And if I love Him well;
But with what love He loveth me,
My tongue can never tell;
It is an everlasting love,
Much more as days go by;
And so we love each other,
My Lord and I.

4
I tell Him all my sorrows,
I tell Him all my joys;
I tell Him all that pleases me,
I tell Him what annoys;
He tells me what I ought to do,
He tells me how to try;
And so we talk together,
My Lord and I.

5
He knows my heart’s such longing,
Some weary soul to win;
And so He bids me go and speak,
The loving word for Him;
He bids me tell His wondrous love,
And why He came to die;
And so we work together,
My Lord and I.

Lord, You are Beloved, Fairest of the fair;
Altogether lovely, unrivaled beauty;
It’s You! Your presence, I long for and seek;
You’re the One in whom my heart delights,
So, I just love to tell You...

c
Jesus, I love You,
My treasure, You are;
How could I choose anything less than You?
Dear Lord, my inmost heart You’ve captured and won.

2
Dead I was in sin, Lord, so lost without You;
Helpless, wounded, weary, rebellious, too;
But Lord, You came! You would not let me go;
The blood and water flowed from Your side,
Constraining me to tell You...

3
Thank You Lord, You opened my blind eyes to see;
I was lame, but now I can walk; You healed me!
My leprosy, Lord, You cleansed all away;
My ears were opened to hear Your voice,
And now I follow You ’cause...

4
Sometimes Lord, I’m drawn off by my selfish cares;
And the world it draws me with glitter and glare.
O Lord, You’ve trapped me. Don’t let me go.
Kiss me and woo me, and win my heart,
So, I will always tell You...

5
Keep my heart so soft, Lord, so open to You;
It would be the good ground to bear fruit for You;
Capture my friends, Lord, and build us, I pray;
Your Bride, We’d match You in every way,
And, corporately we tell You:

c2
Jesus, come quickly,
We’re waiting for You;
We’re the virgins to You,
So single and true;
Forever and ever Your counterpart true.

Mary poured out her love offering.
To many such love was a waste.
Throughout all of the centuries
Such lovers Your sweetness do taste.
Precious lives and heart treasures too,
Positions and golden futures
Have been “wasted” on You Lord,
Your sweetness—a fragrance so sure.

c
She took opportunity                     
To love You; Lord, with her best.
Like her, Lord, I too would pour
My love and all that I have.

2
As I love You I set my being,
My spirit, my soul and body,
With my heart, my mind and my strength
Absolutely on Thee.
Lord, I let my entire being
Be occupied by Thee.
As I enter in Your heart,
I sense the fellowship sweet.

c2
Occupied and lost in You,
My Lord, You’re my everything.
Fellowship so intimate;
In spirit, Lord, I enjoy Thee.

3
Lord there’s none in heav’n nor on earth
That I desire but Thee.
Though my heart and flesh faileth Lord,
Thou ever my portion will be.
All is vanity, all is dung,
I count all other things loss.
Every thing else drains my love,
But You have captured my heart.

c3
Lord, I’ve seen Thy preciousness,
Thy worth, Thy reality.
Now, my Lord, I must confess,
My heart is only for Thee.

What made You, Lord, to die for me?                     
Why would You die for me, Your enemy?
You took my place to hang on a tree,
To be a curse, a curse for me.

c
What made You die for me?
I was Your enemy.                     
Lord, You became a curse for me.
O what a mystery,
My God, You died for me!                     
You died for me, Your enemy.

2
I never thought that You would be
So full of love and tender mercy.
How could You love a person like me?
You loved me, dear Jesus, Your enemy.

3
You loved me, Lord, so very long;
And with a love enduring and strong.
Although I mocked and cursed You so long,
You waited and prayed for me all along.

4
I was a man who was just sin,
Which issued in a life full of sins.
My heart toward You was in rebellion,
But, Lord, You touched me with Your compassion.

c2
Your love has conquered me,
Even Your enemy.
In love, dear Lord, You came to me.
Nothing could change me
But love and mercy.
Your love, dear Lord, has conquered me.

5
One little turn and You were there,
Waiting for me with Your loving care.
How could I still remain Your enemy?
Your love, dear Jesus, disarmed me.

Life has no meaning,
Just vanity.
Jesus,
Reality.

Jesus in me,
What a wonder;
Bubbling over,
Living Water.
Jesus,
What a joy!

Lord, there’s always been one person
Like Abraham who ran to meet You.
Samuel, he ministered,
And David had a heart full of praise,
But You want many more.

2
Lord, we want to be that people
That minister and refresh You,
Meet Your need, and wash Your feet,
That satisfy Your heart’s desire
And be a friend to You.                     
What can we do?

c
We can call O Lord,
We can praise Your name,
Turn our hearts to You,
Let You rule and reign.
Lord, a single heart that’s true,
That’s what we desire.

3
Lord, You’ve shown You’re rich in mercy
To those saints who stand together
In Your plan, one new Man.
So grant us all a single heart;
A heart that just loves You,
A heart that’s true.

c2
We can call O Lord,
We can praise Your name,
Turn our hearts to You,
Let You rule and reign.
Lord, a single heart that’s true,
That’s what we desire—
A heart for You.

I love God because He loved me long
before the world began.
I love God because He knew my destiny.
I love God because He made me
part of His eternal plan.
I love God because He first loved me.

c
I love Him for all the things
He’s done for me.
I love Him for all that He is,
all that He is to me.
But, most of all,
I love Him as the Spirit who                     
deep within my spirit lives.

2
I love God because He came in time
to be the Son of Man.
I love God because He gave Himself for me.
I love God because He conquered death
that I might live again.
I love God because He first loved me.

3
I love God because He’s processed now
to be my life within.
I love God because He is transforming me.
I love God because He’s building up
the New Jerusalem.
I love God because He still loves me.

Shepherd, receive man,
Come near and eat with them,
Publicans and sinners.
Go out to carry them home
On Your shoulders, rejoicing.
Lord, carry them home.

2
Spirit, dear Spirit,
Where is the one lost coin?
Yes, You have the nine,
But the one You must find.
Dear Spirit, You’re sweeping
All over the earth.

3
Father, dear Father,
Have mercy on mankind!
He’s fallen to the pig’s pen.
When will he return?
Dear Father, just kiss them,
Your son’s coming home.

4
Father of mercy,
Clothe him with the best robe
And kill the fatted calf
And eat and be merry—
He was lost, but found,
Was dead, but now he lives

Give yourself to love the Lord.
No other way is so prevailing                     
And no other way, no other way is so safe.

No other way is so rich,
And so full, oh so full, of enjoyment.

“Lord Jesus, I love You.”

Do not care for anything else;
Just love Him! Do not care!

Lord, how I thank You that
You died on the cross for me.
Your mercy, my Savior, reached me.                     
And Lord, You paid the highest price,
My life bought with Your shed blood,
My life now belongs, Lord, to You.                     

c
And Lord, how can I turn away from Your love,
The eternal love which You have for me?                     
I give You my heart;
Lord, spread in every part,
Till my whole heart belongs to You.

2
Lord, gain my heart so that
It is single and pure for You.
No other love, Lord would I know.
Lord, I am so in love with You.
For You are so lovely,
My everything, my all in all.

c2
And Lord, I really want to know
this Person inside of me.
Lord, keep my heart open to You.
Keep flowing Your life
Into me that I would grow,
And be saturated with You.

Anything that’s less than You,

Keep me faithful unto Thee.

Draw me, Lord, each day;
Take my veils away.

No one else for me.

Give my whole being unto Thee.

I’ve tried in vain a thousand times,
To do the good I cannot do.
I want to do, I’ve tried to do.
I’m wretched!  I need someone to
deliver me.
Can you tell me who?

c
My God has a heart of love.
My God has a heart of love.

2
E’en though I’m dead, offences great,
I’ve heard of One whose mercy’s rich.
His love is great, so great to us.
“Believe Him”, some say is the way to
deliver me.
Can this be the way?

3
I opened wide.  I asked Him in.
What peace I found.  His love is mine.
I’m now His child, a child of God.
He saved me from my old life and
delivered me!
Can I tell you who?

4
Now when I want to try to do,
I speak my heart out to this One.
He hears the whispers of my heart.
He saves me ’cause He loves me and
delivers me.
Let Him save you too!

Loving through a stormy way,
Even when my faith is small,

Into this poor heart of mine;

Loving Jesus, that is all.

Where the vict’ry song we’ll sing;
O what an honor, reigning with the Lord;
Angels’ celebrations ring.

Living water flowing free;
The tree of life with fruits abundant, sweet,
Satisfies eternally.

Draw me, dear Lord;
Draw me today.
From everything else, dear Lord;
Draw me away. (Today)

O Lord, this whole world,
Seems to weigh me down;
All the cares, the strife, the sin;
Within me and all around.

3
But, Lord, I want to set my heart;
And Lord, I want to stay with You;
Cause only when You’re near to me.
Is everything okay.

And though everything may fall apart
Or everything go my way;
It doesn’t really matter, Lord,
As long as I gain You today!

It’s there on the cross where You bled and died for me.
Lord Jesus, I thank You, I’m fully justified in Thee.

You’re precious to me.

You are the only One for me.

Daily I come to be supplied by Your word.
It’s by this supply that I’m richly satisfied.
It’s here that I’m strengthened to live the Christian life.
It’s nothing I do, but Your overflowing grace to me.

Each day as I wake up I come to You, Lord.
Our fellowship sweet must be daily restored.
Void of offense, keep my conscience so pure.
Soften me, Lord, so that You alone may have my heart.

Of the One who gave His life for me.
How can I turn away from Thee;
Lord, I have seen Thy changeless love for me.

c
Enjoyment so full!
Life’s reality!
That’s what You’re to me:

Take my heart, take my whole life too;
Lord, I can’t help giving myself to You.

From the day that I first met You.
How could I help falling in love with You?
Emptiness turned life’s pleasures blue;
No earthly love ever could see me through.

’Till I turned one day
Opened up my heart,
Let Your love flow in
And fill my deepest part.
Now I know, Lord, You’re one with me;
And I can’t help giving myself to Thee.

We cannot but love Him—as one we proclaim:
“Lord Jesus, we love Thee—exalt Thy dear name!”

O Jesus, our Jesus, with Thee we are blest—
Our Life, our Enjoyment, our Peace and our Rest:
Thy name be our theme, and Thy love be our song;
Thy love has inspired both our heart and our tongue!

Thy dearness, so precious, and Thy loveliness?
When we see Thy beauty, all else fades away—
All shadows must flee at the breaking of day!

I pursue You like a dove;
I belong to You, and You’re my Beloved.                     

c
Everything under the sun is vanity:
It’s like chasing after wind, so emptily;
You have put within me, Lord, eternity...

Now I rise to come away;
In the cleft rock, Lord, I would ever stay.
Kiss me, Lord; refresh me, too,
As I gaze at You, and Your death I view.

c2
You were broken on the cross for me, dear Lord.
All Your being, life and love for me was poured.
Precious One, You are the One that I adore...

3
Make me, Lord, a fragrance true,
As a garden filled, with Your spices new.
Transform me, Your Bride to be,
For Your heart’s desire, through eternity.

c3
As Your lover in the veil, I long to be,
Be conformed to Your sweet death continually,
’Til Your city we become eternally.

Lord, there’s nothing in this world like You—
You fill me up completely.
And I would never give You up for anything,
Because nothing else could satisfy me so.

1
People think that they can find
Satisfaction, peace of mind.
Everything leads to another,
But I found the best.

2
No more trying something else,
Or thinking that there’s something more;
No more hoping “someday,”
’Cause today I have the best.

3
Looking not at failures past,
Hoping not in future dreams;
Not wishing I were different,
Knowing everything’s the best.

To speak my love out to You.

They all can say the same thing—

I love You, Lord—O so much!

Make me wholly Thine.

With all my heart and all my soul.

I give myself to be Yours alone.

Lift my eyes to gaze on You;

Preparing us for the coming wedding day.

Dearer each day to me,

Becoming reality.                     
Saving me, loving me,
Faith and hope giving me.
You’re all the world to me, Jesus my Lord.

Even when faith is small,
When there’s no hope at all,
I hear Him say to me,
Trust in Me and you’ll see,
That I’ll supply all your needs,
If only you will believe.
All anxious doubts will cease,
While trusting in Me.

Joined and mingled with You,

Foretaste of the New Jerusalem.

In this godless age,
Lord, You need some Samuels
Burdened with a vision clear of Your economy.
Where’s Your ark today?
And the ones who’d care for You,
E’en to put themselves aside to gain Your heart’s desire?

c
Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,
Prophets, priests, and judges, and men of prayer,
Speaking forth Your word, with Your authority,
A photo of Your heart for Your move.

2
Train us up today,
Full of vision, seeking You,
We’d await Your timing, fully subject to Your will,
Treasuring Your face,
Staying in Your presence, Lord;
E’en the very index of Your eyes would we obey.

c2
Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,
To bring in Your kingdom on earth today,
Taking You as King that You may return
To usher in the end of the age.

3
When God wants to move,
He must gain an instrument;
Overcomers separated from the current age.
They have joined themselves
Through His word to His desire.
Overcomers constituted with the holy word.

c3
Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,
Voluntary consecreated ones,
Who through Your word are joined to Your desire;
Your living testimony on the earth.

4
God needs men who pray;
Those who lay the tracks for Him;
God’s economy is carried out through men of prayer.
They love not themselves;
But a willing sacrifice.
What they fear—offending God, losing His presence dear.

c4
Make us those who meet Your need, the Nazarites.
Make us those through who You’d close this age;
Who are one with You to bring the kingdom in,
Young people absolute for Your move.

We are the generation                     
The Lord has waited for.                     
He has sought us and pursued us.                     
When we touched Him, He renewed us.                     
Now the time has come
For all the young
To be in touch with Him!

God loves this generation —
He chose us for His plan.
We were young and disillusioned
In the age of mass confusion.
Now we are His choice,
We all rejoice —
To God we say “Amen”

c
Once we were searching,
Always worrying —
When would we end our search?
Now we’re reborn;
Our veils are torn,
Since He brought us to the church!

3
At last our search has ended;
Our praises fill the air.
We’re the chosen generation!
Jesus loves this generation!
And the time has come
For all the young
To be in love with Him!

There’s nothing else to do,                     
My world is over now!                     
All the world lies in the evil one,                     
But I’m the Father’s son;                     
His love has met my need.

My heart could never be
Content with less than You.
Deep within, my heart cries out to You,
Hungry and thirsty too
For that sweet flow of life.

Shining One, in me direct Thy rays,
Shine through all false displays;
Let me not be deceived.
Lord, I know, I need Thy light to shine,
How else can I be Thine?
You must enlighten me.

4
Cleanse me now; don’t let one sin remain.
I cannot be the same;
Your life is all I need.
Oh forgive my failure and my sin.
Make me so clean within
So You can flow in me.

5
Oh, the joy! To have that life and peace!
Darkness and death have ceased
In Thy sweet presence, Lord.
Oh, the joy from fellowship so real!
Even the heav’ns, I feel,
Cannot compare with this.

Lord, I give myself to You completely;
How I praise You for the flow of life!
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
I love You, I really do!

Let me love and not be respected;
Let me serve and not be rewarded;
Let me labor and not be remembered;
Let me suffer and not be regarded.

2
’Tis the pouring, not the drinking;
’Tis the breaking, not the keeping—
A life suff’ring to seek other’s blessing,
A life loving and true comfort giving.

3
Not expecting pity and concern,
Not accepting solace and applause;
Even lonely, even forgotten,
Even wordless, even forsaken.

4
Tears and blood my price
For the righteous crown shall be;
Losing all, my cost for a faithful pilgrim’s life.
’Twas the life, O Lord, that You chose to live
In those days when on earth You walked.
Gladly suff’ring all injuries and loss
So that all might draw near and repose.

5
I cannot see how much farther I shall go;
Still I press on, knowing there is no return.
Let me follow Your pattern so perfect and true,
Bearing ingratitudes without complaint.
In this time of trial, O my Lord, I pray
That You’d wipe all my hidden tears away;
Let me learn, O Lord, You are my reward,
Let me be other’s blessing all my days.

Come in, come in, to the good land,
Christ, the church, the one new man.

3
With the calling comes the promise
Of the kingdom life on earth.
This becomes our strength and motive
To get out of all the dearth!

c3
Lord, we’re crossing every river—
For this You must call us on,
’Til Your kingdom and expression
On this earth are fully come.

4
This is now the highest gospel
To those still in Chaldee’s land—
Leave the fallen situation,
You’ve been chosen for God’s plan.

c4
God of Glory, God of Glory,
Do appear to us each day,
Call us out into Your building,
Your desire on earth today.

I’ve given up the world because
I’ve found something more;
He’s better than anything
I’ve ever found before.
Yes, I have found the Living One,
Oh, how my spirit soars!
I called His name, I’m not the same;
I am for the Lord!

c
I’m for the Lord,
I’m loving Jesus,
I’m for the Lord,
I’m calling O Lord Jesus!                     

2
I’ve given up the world because
I’ve found something better;
I have found the Living One
And He breaks every fetter.
Yes, He’s the One who set me free,
Oh, how my spirit soars!
I called His name, I’m not the same;
I am for the Lord!

3
And now I’m really happy,
Yes, I’m fully satisfied;
I have found the Living One
And He lives right inside
Of you and me, so come and see
Now our spirits soar!
We called His name, we’re not the same;
We are for the Lord!

c2
We’re for the Lord,
We’re loving Jesus,
We’re for the Lord,
We’re calling O Lord Jesus!

These are the days, my friend,                     
Time’s drawing to an end,
And we must choose,
must choose whom we will serve.
We will fight for the Lord
And stand in one accord
For the defeat of God’s arch enemy!                     

2
These are the days, O saints,
The heart of man, it faints
For Satan’s work
that’s seen throughout the land.
So we must count all loss,
Be one at any cost,
And give our all for God’s recovery.

3
These are the days, my friend,
The Spirits moving in
To raise the standard
up against the foe,
To show the one new man
According to His plan
And draw this generation to Himself.

4
These are the latter days,
Go forth and sound His praise,
Proclaim to men
the kingdom that shall come.
The army’s moving out
The enemy to rout,
And Christ will gain His rightful place on earth.


Calgary Songbook :1808

1
More of our heart, dear Lord, we’d give You now;
Even more ground to You, Lord, we’d allow.
All that distracts us we’d despise,
All that draws away our eyes—
Lord, do fill our vision
’Til the morning star has risen!

c
We would count all things loss, but Jesus gain;
Our inward parts cry out for You to reign.
Worthy You are our heart to claim—
Come, engrave on us Your name,
We would love You, Jesus, more.                     

2
Less we would argue, Lord, and go our way;
More we would say “Amen” to what You say.
Grant us a walk to You conformed,
’Til our living is transformed.
We adore You, Jesus—
May a pure love for You seize us.

c2
Any unwillingness, Lord, quickly slay;
Even by faith we open all the way—
Rising to heights of love unknown,
Christ our destiny alone,
We would love You, Jesus, more!

1
Life’s too short
To waste a single day.
The kingdom life
Is closer every day.

c
In the midst of time,
The kingdom’s mine
Just by calling on His name each day.                     

2
The sweetest taste
Of life is deep within.
Its flowing out
Is primed by calling Him.

c2
In the midst of time,
The kingdom’s mine.
Just by calling on His name each day.

3
Time is quickly
Running out each day,
The Lord will come
And swiftly end this age.

c3
At the end of time,
The goal we see,
The Millennium is our entry.

c4
At the end of time,
The goal we see,
The New Jerusalem we’ll be.

Lord, keep my heart always true to You,
Never backsliding, always viewing You,
A heart that is pure, that sees only You,
A heart that loves You and treasures only You.

c
Your love constrains me to give my all to You.
Lord, I can’t help it; my heart is drawn to You.
Oh what a privilege! I give myself to You!
I love You, Lord, dearest Lord.
I love You! I just love You!

2
Lord, keep my love burning brightly for You,
A love never dwindling, always hot for You,
A love shining brighter all the way for You,
A love so fresh like the day I first touched You.

3
Lord, take my life, I present it to You!
If I had a thousand, I’d pour all on You!
Nothing withholding, my all is for You.
My life and my future, dear Lord, is all for You.


Calgary Songbook :1811

1
Take my life and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

c
For me, You were mocked and crucified;
For me, willingly You bled and died.
Lord, my life and love I willingly outpour
And will serve You evermore.

2
Take my hands and feet, I pray
For Thy work, to run Thy way.
Take my lips that I may sound
Words of truth to those around.

3
Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold.
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

4
Make my heart and will Thine own;
They belong to Thee alone.
Take my love; my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store.

5
Take me, Lord, till I’ve become
Ever joined to Thee as one.
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee.


Calgary Songbook :1812

1
We give ourselves to Thee, O Lord Jesus,
Never to turn aside;
Where’er the Lamb goes, there we would follow,
Follow whate’er betide.

c
We must follow the Spirit
In all simplicity.
In our spirit is Jesus—
He follows perfectly!

2
We give ourselves the flock’s steps to follow,
Knowing the Shepherd’s care.
Now in the churches Jesus is leading
And He is speaking there.

3
We give ourselves to follow the churches,
Oneness in Christ display;
Follow His move in all of the churches,
Stand fast as one this way

4
We give ourselves to enter the Kingdom,
That marriage feast, with Him;
Come persecution, suffering, and trials,
Still we will enter in.

5
Christ wants some followers here in the churches,
Followers of whom to say:
“These saw my purpose, followed me wholly”—
May we be those today!

Tune: Lord now I see

1
Lord, keep me from this evil and perverted age;
Wholly sanctify my eyes—on You to gaze.
Satisfy my deepest part.
O Lord, preserve my heart.

2
Rescue me, Lord, from this dark world—it’s just display.
Shine in me, and show me, Lord, You are the way.
Nothing matches me but You.
Only Your life will do.

3
Lord, cause my love for You to grow in me each day.
Through this love, show me the world’s passing away.
Separate me unto You.
O Lord, my heart renew.

4
Don’t let me go; I’m here for You and this You know.
Day by day, Your life within me has to grow.
Though this world is so corrupt,
I can and do love You.

5
O Lord, become a river flowing out of me,
That the world may take a drink of You and see
That You are the only way,
The One reality.


Calgary Songbook :1814

1
Lord Jesus, show me You’re real.                     
I couldn’t doubt Your love for me.
You are my everything, Lord.
Righteousness, peace, and my joy;
How did I have a heart so cold?

2
I gave myself to this world
And kept You far from my heart
Thought I was missing something
Thought I was losing something
Thought I needed much more than You.

3
It took me so long to see
You have desires and a need
My heart is so unyielding;
Why am I so self-seeking?
Burn me Lord, take my life for You.

4
Lord Jesus, show me You’re real
I know I’m likely to fall
But I am wholly cleansed now
You gave Your life for me; and
Everything I am is just You.

5
Lord Jesus, I know You’re real
Just turn my face to Your face
And all doubts fly away, Lord,
Your wants are my desires and
All I can say is I love You.


Calgary Songbook :1815

Into Your hands, to You I owe
My life, my love, to You belong.
Lift up my hands—sing You this song.

Nothing can tear us apart.
To You, I give my all.
Dear Lord, I love You so.

2
O, Dearest Lord, I cry to You.
Don’t let me go away from You.
Lord, change my heart—to You belong.
My future, Lord, be Yours alone.

3
Your servant, Lord, cry out to You.
Let me be always serving You.
You, O Lord, You, O Lord,
Dear Lord, You alone.
You, O Lord, You, O Lord,
Serving You alone.

Lord, by Your mercy, I would take
This opportunity
To let You live Yourself in me;
And let You, Lord, gain me.                     

c
Lord, save me from the past,
And save me from the future;
Yesterday is over,
Tomorrow may not be;                     
I only have this day;
I only have this moment.                     

2
And I would hope that You would take
This opportunity
To go as far as possible,
As possible in me.

3
Though many barriers hidden be,
You know, Lord, deep within—
Lord I want nothing else but You,
Lord, I want no one else but You.

4
So only this moment have I,
This opportunity;
This precious time I grant, dear Lord,
Solely unto You.

Good morning to You, Lord Jesus!
I consecrate myself to You today.
Lord Jesus!  I love You!
Oh, fill me with Your Spirit!
And saturate me Lord, I pray.

Good morning, dear Lord... Hallelujah!
My spirit is alive and bold today
Come forward is Your call
To the holiest of all
Your blood has cleared a new and living way.                     

2
Good morning, amen... Oh praise the Lord!
I live this day one spirit with You.
To Your Word I say amen.
Give me fresh experience again.
My heart, my mind, Lord soften and renew.

3
Oh Lord, this is the day of my salvation
Your living Word will operate in me
Today You are my choice
I’ll exercise to hear Your voice.
Then let You live and move and speak in me.


Calgary Songbook :1818

1
Though the world may promise me more,
I’m just made to be filled with the Lord.
Nor is life worth living a day
For the things that will soon pass away.

c1
Doesn’t matter how rich or successful I’ll be,
Or how many pleasures be offered to me
There’s nothing that compares to my destiny
To be thoroughly filled with the Lord.

2
Even though I’m still kind of young
And my future is in front of me.
In my heart I’ve heard the Lord’s call
Just to follow Him absolutely.

c2
Though the cup may be holding much joy or much pain
What matters is that more of Him I would gain.
Regardless what happens I never would change
’Cause I’m made to be filled with the Lord.


Calgary Songbook :1819

1
Lord I give myself to You again today
Lord, on this consecration path I choose to stay
You bought me with a price
My life I sacrifice
Lord, I am not my own.

2
Lord, I give myself to You again today
Your mercy reached me though I was so far away
You gave Yourself for me
From whose earthly dreams You freed
Lord, I am Yours alone.

3
Lord, I give myself to You again today
I open to You so that You may have a way
To work in me that I
Might serve You my whole life
Lord, I love You alone.

Oh, the joy of having nothing,
Being nothing, seeing nothing,
But a living Christ in glory,
And being careful for nothing
Oh, the joy of having nothing,
Being nothing, seeing nothing,
But a living Christ in glory,
And His interest here on earth.

I have decided to follow Jesus.                     
I have decided to follow Jesus.                     
I have decided to follow Jesus,                     
No turning back, no turning back.

The world behind me, the cross before me.
The world behind me, the cross before me.
The world behind me, the cross before me,
No turning back, no turning back.

Though none go with me, still I will follow.
Though none go with me, still I will follow.
Though none go with me, still I will follow,
No turning back, no turning back.

Where Jesus leads me, I’ll surely follow.
Where Jesus leads me, I’ll surely follow.
Where Jesus leads me, I’ll surely follow,
No turning back, no turning back.

1
I want to tell You, Lord, how much You mean to me.
Through years of careful molding, Your plan at last I see.
Though pain I’ve had—and suffering too,
Myself I yield at last, Lord, to You.

2
I want to care for You, the way You’ve cared for me.
You’ve been my friend to comfort,
received me when I’ve strayed.
And in return—I offer You
My life—so small compared, Lord, to You.

3
I’d like for You to fill me with all that You are.
And empty out my heart from everything You’re not.
You’ve blessed me Lord—by finding me.
Possess me now eternally.


Calgary Songbook :1823

1
Lord, You are my only goal!
You’re my only hope!
I only care for You!
I never could replace You,
And I would never want to.
I have everything, Lord—
I have You!

2
Lord, I only live for You—
Not anything else!
In everything, You’re my source;
No more good intentions,
No more right or wrong.
I don’t want a “good” life—
I want You!

I’m a beggar ’cause... I’m blind
So I take what I... can find
I’m groping for rea...lity
Only wishing I... could see
My parents, they can see
Why is this blindness in me?
All I know is I want to see reality

2
Lord, I am sitting by... the road
Begging outside of Je...richo
Now, Lord I hear that You... pass by
Lord, Son of David... I cry
Lord, Son of David, I cry
Please, Christ, don’t pass me by
I believe that you can open my eyes

3
You gave me life but where’s... my sight?
I am still blind and that’s... my plight
Blind lead the blind and then... both fall
So right now on You... I call
Jesus have mercy on me
Open my eyes that I might see
All I know is my only hope is in You

4
Lord I am rebuked by... the crowd
For You I cry out more... the loud
All the world wants to di...stract me
So I forget that I... can’t see
Jesus don’t leave me behind
You are the one I want to find
All I know is I just really need You

Still I’m afraid that You’ll... go on
But joyful ears hear You... respond
What would you like for me... to do
Oh Christ I just want to see You
Open my eyes to... see You
Let me find what my spirit can do
All I know is I just want to see You

In my spirit I... can see
Because that’s where You... touch me
By your touch dear Lord... I’m healed
All my sin and death... must yield
Now Lord, I am healed
In my spirit You are so real
All I know is I want to keep touching You

7
Lord my sight is for... one thing
So that I to You... can cling
I think I’m in love... with You
No one else for me... will do
Lord Christ let me follow You please
You’re so real and so special to me
All I know is Lord I never want to leave


Calgary Songbook :1901

Lord, now I see,
You only want me to believe,
Not to change.
In all my failures and defeats,
To believe what You have done,
And not in what I see.

2
Lord I believe,
When all around me is defeat
And it seems that nothing’s changing outwardly.
No! I’m not discouraged,
I’m believing You.

3
Yes, I believe,
And there is no demand on me.
Simple faith, yes, that is all You want from me.
Freed from anxious doubting—
I’m free to just believe!

4
Believing You,
Because, Lord, You are my success!
When I fail, all I must do is just confess,
And go on enjoying You—
I love believing You!

I never thought that God would be enjoyable;
And my experience of Him is indescribable;
When first I opened up my heart to Him;
He came in me and filled me to the brim...

c
O Lord, You’re wonderful,
You’re wonderful,
Jesus, Jesus.                     

2
I never sought Him, nor I ever asked for Him;
Sometimes I wonder “Am I in a heavn’ly dream?”
I don’t deserve Him, oh a sinner like me;
My explanation, friends, it’s just His mercy...

c2
O Lord, Your mercy reached me,
Your mercy reached me,
Jesus, Jesus.

3
My friends they tell me, “Don’t be too  much for Him;
Just be so ‘normal’ and not go the extreme.”
But I can’t help it, there is no One like Him,
His love has touched me so I now have meaning...

c3
O Lord, Your love has touched me,
Your love has reached me,
Jesus, Jesus.

4
My every moment is to live unto You;
In everything dear Lord, You must now break through;
I’m just a vessel, You’re my treasure within;
O Lord, keep spreading in my entire being...

c4
By calling, O Lord Jesus,
That Name, most precious,
Jesus, Jesus.

5
And now I’m waiting for Your coming again;
Lord, keep me faithful to You unto the end;
To see You face to face on that great day;
’Tis my desire that I’d go all the way...

c5
O Lord, You’re coming soon,
Our lovely Bridegroom,
Jesus, Jesus.

I’m walking down the road                     
That leads to glory.                     
I’m pressing toward the mark                     
By enjoying God!                     
I don’t know so much,                     
Just to love Him.
I’m walking down the road,                     
Glory, here I come.                     

1
With the brothers and the sisters,
We enjoy Him day by day.
It’s so simple and easy,
Our worries flee away.
Now we’re growing together,
As one big family,
Abiding in the joy of the Lord.                     

2
We enjoy You, Lord Jesus,
In our experience.
We’re getting to know You—
It’s making us leap and dance.
Just eating and drinking,
It’s what we do the best,
Delighting in the love of the Lord.

3
We’re walking, not running,
Cause we’re in the pasture land.
Our Shepherd is nearby,
We’re trusting in His hand.
He’s everything to us,
He’s all we ever need,
Resting in the peace of the Lord.

God’s economy                     
And His eternal plan,
His heart’s desire and intention
Is to be one with man.
Yet man has failed completely
Throughout all history.
But hallelujah!  Praise the Lord!
God’s life is now in me.

2
Now this life in me is flowing
As the river of water of life,
Washing away all my sins,
My cares, and all my strife.
This life is overcoming
Situations in my day.
Hallelujah!  Praise the Lord!
For this is what I pray:

c
Lord Jesus, I love You!
I give You the preeminence in what I do.
Enjoying You is the overcoming way.
Thank You for Your recovery;
Your Word we will obey.                     

3
Thank You for our situations
And the environments we are in.
That we’d turn to You in all things,
And turn away from sin.
We’d drop all our anxieties
And put our trust in You.
And experience this living One
Whose life is ever new.

4
Now the church life is so precious
With all the saints so dear.
Enjoying all Your riches,
Our vision is so clear,
That all would prophesy
Of Christ from what they’ve seen,
According to Your scripture
In First Corinthians fourteen.

Lord, how long, dear Bridegroom,
’Til You come, Lord, how soon?
Don’t delay for that coming day, coming day.
Grant me, Lord, to be filled
With You, Lord, ev’ry day.
Dearest Lord, take me all the way.

c
Come, Lord Jesus.
Please come, dear Bridegroom.
Precious One, come soon, come soon.
Lord, consume me!
Oh Lord, don’t let me stray,
Faithful to You all the way.

2
Lord, make home in all my heart,
In my secret, deepest parts,
Hidden, Lord, and reserved for You, for You.
You would be preeminent
In all things and all events,
Possessed by Thee to this extent.

3
In my prayer and deepest plea,
In my spirit always be,
Saturated and soaked with Thee, with Thee.
This would be my life daily,
Every hour expecting Thee,
This I pray, Lord, desperately.

4
The universe, in it we see,
In the sweetest touch of Thee,
You’re my choice and my destiny, destiny.
Lord, whate’er the price may be,
Lord, Amen, let it be,
Oh, my love, please come back quickly!

5
In Your love I am constrained.
What’s within, I can’t contain.
Lord I can’t anymore restrain, restrain.
In Your love, I’ll pour on Thee,
And the church, Your Bride to be.
This my choice voluntarily.


Calgary Songbook :1906

c
Lord, grant me today’s supply of grace;
May Your divine life grow apace;
Little by little, day by day, to grow
More and more, into You.

1
Day by day, bit by bit, life will grow as is fit,
Increasing gradually until,
However imperceptibly, Your life matures within me.                     

2
I would be desperately, constantly, patiently,
Drawing each breath of life from You, Lord;
Knowing that every day while I breathe,
Your life will permeate me.

3
Every day, may I rest, knowing that each bequest,
Matches my daily need exactly;
Jesus Christ intercedes for me, a member of His body.

c2
Lord, grant me a heavenly, corporate view;
That all of my growth and prayers to You,
Little by little, day by day,
would cause building up into You.

4
We would be corporately, growing up steadily
Till we reach the stature of Your fullness;
Transforming and conforming us, Your
Manifested people.

I:(Chorus 1)

Lord, grant me a heavenly, corporate view;
That all of my growth and prayers to You,
Little by little, day by day, would cause building up into
the New Jerusalem.

Just to be in You as You’re in me,
Just abide in You, Lord, constantly.
Here I’m one with You, as You’re with me.
Here we’re joined as one, Lord, mutually.

c
God’s dispensing, His economy,
In His Trinity,
He’s transfusing and He’s mingling
All He is to me.

I am just a branch, and You’re the vine.
As I dwell in You, everything is fine.
Here I’d like to be, Lord, all the time.
Here I’m Yours, dear Lord, and You are mine.

3
I’m a branch that’s been, Lord, grafted in.
I’m supplied in You in this life union.
Here Your riches, Lord, in this sweet life flow.
As I dwell in You, I will surely grow.

4
As I dwell in You, and You in me,
Here I’m joined to You, Lord, practically.
As I stay with You, as You’re with me,
We will mingle, Lord, subjectively.

5
As I’m loving You and enjoying You, Lord,
You become in me the rhema word.
Here I’ll pray in You as You pray in me.
You’ll bear fruit in me, Lord, abundantly.

6
As I dwell in You, Lord, You’re flowing through.
Lord, You’re filling me, overflowing too.
Here we all are one and expressing You.
Here our joy is full as we dwell in You.

Until He comes again,
I’ll watch and wait and call on Him.
I’ll pray that by His life and power,
I’ll overcome in every hour.

2
Until He comes again,
His blood will cleanse me of my sin.
His word will sanctify within,
And make me wholly unto Him.

c
Brothers: He died to be Life to me
Brothers: From death, I’m free.
Sisters: He rose and as Spirit, He                     
Sisters: Now lives in me.
Brothers: In splendor and in glory
Brothers: Like Him, I’ll be.

3
Until He comes again,
My soul-life, I’ll give up for Him.
No worldly pleasure can compare
To what my Savior has to share.

4
And when He comes again,
All saints built up and one in Him.
His Body, Bride, and Counterpart,
Eternal pleasure of His heart.

c2
Sisters: Lord, gain Your kingdom in me,
Sisters: I long to be.
Brothers: One with my Savior and King,
Brothers: Eternally.
Sisters: Oh, what a joy, it will be
Sisters: Your face to see.

Of talks alone with Thee,
With hours and minutes, moments too
That I would thus know Thee.

2
Bless me with Thy presence sweet,
For I have naught but Thee;
Yea, nothing left but Thee Thyself,
Lord, give Thyself to me.

3
Bless me with Thy shining light
And deal with every part.
That I would unreserved be
A channel of Thine heart.

4
Bless Thee Lord forevermore;
Come in these days between
’Til one day I am as Thou art
And Morning Star be seen.

1
Lord, You have searched me and You have known me
You understand my thoughts from afar!
You comprehend my path
And are acquainted with all my ways
For there is not a word on my tongue,
But behold You know it all together!

c
Search me, O God, and know my heart
Try me and know my anxieties
See if there is any wicked in me
And lead me in the way everlasting!

2
Lord, You have touched me and You have shown me
That I am not so simple as I thought.
I often run and hide, prone to an errant heart.
But there is not a pause and You pursue!
And behold You’ve caught me altogether!

c2
Where can I go from Your Spirit, O Lord?
I can’t flee from Your presence, You’re inside me.
I’ve climbed the steep mountains,
but You still are there,
Descend to the valleys but You find me.

3
Now I see, there’s something more to this pattern:
You want to show me all that You are.
So You’ve drawn me from this strife, into the family life.
As one, our prayers can match Your deep desires.
Now behold we follow You together!


Calgary Songbook :1911

1
Rain on me; rain on me;
Let Your mercy rain on me;
It is not by willing or by running, Lord;
Let Your mercy rain on me.

2
Reign in me; reign in me;
May Your life, Lord, reign in me,
By Your grace abundant and Your righteousness;
May Your life, Lord, reign in me.

3
Overcome, overcome;
Lord, I pray to overcome,
By the Spirit sevenfold intensified;
Lord, I pray to overcome.

4
Grow in me; grow in me;
For the Body grow in me,
Through the rich dispensing of Your life supply;
For the Body grow in me.

5
Transform me; transform me;
For the Body transform me;
I behold Your glory with an unveiled face;
For the Body transform me.

6
Lord, gain me; Lord, gain me;
In the Body, Lord, gain me,
For the full expression of the Triune God;
In the Body, Lord, gain me.

7
Lord, blend me; Lord, blend me;
In the Body, Lord, blend me,
For the consummation—New Jerusalem;
In the Body, Lord, blend me.

As we become the same as Christ
in life, nature, expression and function,
we are qualified to work with Him for his Body

2
As we trust in the Lord helplessly,
depend on Him as our love and strength,
and listen to His speaking,
our hope is to be raptured
through the redemption of our bo - dy
and our prayer is - "Come, Lord Jesus!"
And our prayer is - "Come, Lord Jesus!"
Come, Lord Jesus!
Lord Jesus come!

Your love constrains me,
A tide overflowing
Softens my hard heart,
Erases my care
For You will take me,
Break me, remake me,
An overcomer,
Your kingdom to share.

None can compare with You,
Dearest Lord Jesus,
You are the ruler of
The kings of the earth
To You who loved us,
And who has washed us,
From all our sins in
Your own precious blood.

Live in life’s flowing,
And feed for His growing,
Drop every barrier,
Gaze in His face.
Shout Hallelujah!
Sound out Your victr’y,
You who will live Him
To finish the race.

On the cross You gave your life for me
that I might live again
In resurrection You have lifted me
to newness born within.
Through the blood I repent of all my sins
precious Lord I now give in.
Fill me Lord Jesus,
Lord I ask you to come in

2
Upon my heart do write O Lord,
so the Christ in me may grow
Renew me in my mind too Lord,
that your life through me may show
Calling O Lord Jesus,
wherever I may be
Thank you sweet, sweet Jesus,
for today you’ve set me free

3
Lord I really love you
You’re everything I need
Make Your home within my heart
only You I will believe.
Loving You, and Living You,
with a heart that’s pure and true,
O dear Lord Jesus
I trust my life to you

God’s desire—Life for man;
His intention—a building for His home;
Shame the devil, victory won.
Take the Word—soon it will be done.

Lord, I call—build me now
With the saints; O Lord, but how?
‘Praying always, in the spirit
With the Word.’ Amen, Lord!

2
Christ as Life—wondrous Person;
All His riches, now our full supply!
For the building, Life’s our need:
Life will build us—the enemy will fly

3
Let us rise—with our weapon;
Give ourselves for the Building of the Lord:
Slay contention, kill opinions:
This our weapon—the Spirit’s living sword.

4
There is a way that we can know the Life of Jesus;
And by this Life we’ll be built up as one for his home;
Just turn to Him and take His Word by prayer,
In your spirit daily pray His Word, pray His Word.

Tune: "Lord now I see"

1
Lord, do unveil
The more we strive, the more we fail
All the strife—they all come out to no avail.
Lord, they’re just not for your need
By “self”, we won’t succeed.

2
Lord, we confess
We are not able, Lord, unless
We have You; You’re all in all—You’re our success!
All we need, O Lord, is You
’Cause nothing else will do.

3
O Lord, we pray
Increase Thyself in us each day
And the “self”—decrease it ’til it’s done away.
Lord, we want the growth in life
We don’t want all the strife.

4
Lord, life’s begun
Two spirits mingled into one
Day by day, walk in the spirit and we’ve won!
Then the “self” will be decreased
And Christ in us increased.

All as one that we will be
A Bride that matches You perfectly.
Make us all to be,
All to be, all to be
The expression of Your glory.

That Your heart’s desire would be satisfied.

He washed away my sins.
Gave me a brand new heart.
A heart to love Him, trust Him,
seek Him in His Word.

He tells me, “Guard thy heart above all
that thou guardest.
For out of it flow the springs...
the springs of life.”

I forget that He is there:
He’s just there waiting, watching,
then He draws me near.

A life of failure is all I have at best,                     
So full of sin with much self-righteousness;
As I keep going I fail the Lord each day,                     
And I’m brought to my knees to pray:

c
Jehovah Savior, reach me with Your mercy now today,
I need You, Lord Jesus, to save me from my way,
You are faithful, and my hope is in You Lord,
You will deliver me more and more.

2
My heart desires You and yet there are those times,
I realize our hearts do not align;
Your heart’s for Zion, my heart’s not fully there,
But I come forward to declare:

c2
Oh Lord, I open wide to be drawn continually,
Remove the objects of affection by degree,
Substitute them with the interest of Your heart,
A heart for Zion in me You’d impart.


Calgary Songbook :1922

Turn, turn my heart to You;
Lord, I confess my heart is untrue.
Turn, turn my wandering heart;
Lord, unto me Thy love impart.

I call on Thee.
You’re the only One for me!

Rich, rich, He’s rich to all,
Rich unto all that call on His name.
Rich, rich, He’s rich, so call;
Now and forever, Jesus the same.

Love, love, the love of God
Flows as a river, full to the brim.
Love, love, I’m filled with love,
Crazy in love with Jesus within.

1A
I once was dead-–dead in my sins;
Behaved myself in lust of flesh
By nature such a child of wrath,
Even as the rest.

1B
I was once apart from Christ you know
Alien from the wealth of Israel
Not a hope—not even one to tell
Without God in the world.

2A
But God being so merciful
Because of His great love to me
Enlivened me I’m now in Christ
Seated in the heavenlies.

2B
Now in Christ He has become my peace;
By the blood of Christ I am released
I am one with all the saints, since He’s
Broken down the middle wall.

3A
But that’s not all! I’m with the saints 
Together we’re His workmanship
His masterpiece expressing Him
In the heavens and on earth.

3B
He has died creating one new man
Thus fulfilling God’s eternal plan
With all saints together, let us stand
Shout and sing and praise the Lord!

Lying on His sweet breast,

May my Spirit be shining so bright,
May His life bear much fruit,
May I be absolute,
To partake of the living Christ.

Open to Jesus—He is all you need.
He fed the thousands, now He’ll feed you.
Just open your mouth and take Him in—
That’s all you have to do.

He came as food, so now we take Him in.
No doctrines or forms that you have to learn
To come and meet with us.

He is a fountain that will not run dry.
He’s quenching our longings, we’re satisfied,
Just eating and drinking the risen Lord!
Yes, that is why He died;

Fill all our being—Oh, how glorious!

Life is God the Father
In Christ Jesus as the Spirit
Flowing out and coming into us.
He’s not just a teaching,
Or a creed or a dead doctrine,
But the processed Triune God, glorious!

2
Life is not created
As man’s body, soul, and spirit—
That’s man’s life that’s weak and temporal.
Life is uncreated.
It’s divine and it’s eternal.
And this is the life that’s indestructible.

3
And this life came in us
In our spirit through the Spirit;
This is where we were made alive!
Now this life is spreading,
Lord, don’t stop—just keep invading.
For this, Lord, we must be daily revived.

4
Life needs our maintaining,
Otherwise we’re suffocating.
Calling on His name we breathe Him in.
Everywhere we breathe Him,
Makes us fresh and makes us living.
O, this life is full of hope and meaning.

5
In our daily living
It’s this life that we are sensing.
Are we in the flesh or in the Lord?
If you’re dead and empty
And the troubles you have plenty.
Saints, get out of there and flee back to the Lord!

6
Then you’ll sense life flowing.
It’s this life that’s overcoming
Satan, flesh, and the world, and sin.
What a life we’re having.
Lord, Your virtues manifesting.
Thus, we’re branches bearing fruit in John 15.

The Spirit...You were raised to be.
Now You are...living deep in me,
As my hope of glory.

2
Each day Your mercies they are new,
To me refreshing as the dew;
You are my bountiful supply.
Every morning You’re nigh!

3
For me You came from up above,
Because You are the God of love;
Your love will never let me go;
Everyday it flows.

4
Your love flows out to me as grace,
Enabling me to run the race;
As truth You’re my reality,
As my all to be.

5
As I walk on this pilgrim road,
My flesh and self You will erode;
In my heart, You will have Your way;
Take more room each day.

6
Each day the world I leave behind;
You write Your laws upon my mind,
Inscribing on my softened heart,
Filling every part.

Rooted and being built in You,
Absorbing all You are to me,
What a place to be!

New Christ I’m gaining every day,
Still groaning through this world of strife,
I want to live a God-man life!

Lord grow in me! You are the seed,
Of God-man life; You’re all I need.
In all my heart, I give You ground.
Lord, may Your life in me abound!

2
My heart has no desire to stay,
On hardened ground, in the world’s way.
Satan no more shall steal Your Word,
I’ll move my heart where You are heard!

3
I want to deal with rocks in me
From hidden sins, I would be free.
My heart I would clear up through prayer,
I’ll gain more depth to root You there!

4
The choking thorns, us barren make,
The life seed soon they’ll overtake.
Riches, anxiety reject,
Just for God’s growth the ground protect!

5
The sun must shine for us to grow,
So persecution we will know.
When it seems more than we can bear,
Lord, help us drink You deeply there!

6
We want to grow to utmost height,
Until Your body comes in sight.
Yourself in man will then be shown;
Your plan at last by all be known.

I never dreamed there’d come a day
When God would be so real to me
And I knew what it meant to be
A man, simply loving the Lord.

Since I have touched this Living One.
I’ve been set free from death and sin
So now I gladly give my life to Him,
Ever loving the Lord.

And He keeps giving Himself to us.
Living, Jesus is living,

But, Lord, You’re home in me to stay.

Fallen, that’s the way we all begin:
Imprisoned by the evil state we’re in.
How can we from this hard world of sin be saved?

c
Just by calling, “Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.”
Every moment, each day!
Calling the name of Jesus—
We’re finding is the way.
It’s—Jesus, Lord Jesus!

2
Even though we love the Lord so much,
Somehow, it seems that we get out of touch
With Jesus. How can we be freed from such distress?

3
Sometimes we know we aren’t being real.
Then times, we just live by how we feel.
Is there some way we could ever deal with self?

Are wand’ring—Lord, where is Your Bride of worth?
How can all those of the second birth be one?

In the wonderful seed sown in us.

Echoing the hallways of my heart.

’Cause when God gets into you,
You get into God!

Our God is ent’rable,
And He’s enjoyable,

For it is just the chance.

Become Him through and through!

Spend time alone with Him,
Just love Him, talk to Him;
By this we’re deified
And we become His Bride!

Everybody knows it’s Jesus;

Everybody knows it’s Jesus!

Listen closely while we tell you ’bout His wealth,
Come along and call, “Lord Jesus!”

So turn to Him and call, “Lord Jesus!”
Open up your heart and let Him into you

O that Christ may make His home my heart!
Spread Himself in every part!
Saturate and life impart!
That with all saints, I may apprehend
All the vast dimensions of my loving Christ.                     

1
Father God, forgive me if I groan.
For so long I’ve been on a plateau.                     
Now with tears, I bow my knees and pray,
By Your Spirit make my spirit strong today.

As I came this morning to Your word
With no strength to even read a verse
Yet my plea, is “Lord I do need You!”
How You strengthen me, Your power within to prove.

3
I myself was losing heart each day
Then the Lord brought some saints my own way
I alone could not Thee apprehend
But with all the saints You now my joy have been.

4
All this year I’ve come the church to know
Yet, O Lord, there’s things I can’t let go
Yet within me there is an “Amen”
O now joy I never knew in me’s flowin’.

Each time in the morning, a while before dawn
To You, Lord, I whisper a praise or a song,
And feel Your life stirring so deep within me—
My cup runneth over with joy!

2
And then at the moment my heart turns to Thee,
The eyes of my spirit Your presence can see;
While all is so fresh and the sunlight breaks through—
My cup runneth over with joy!

3
And when at the noontime I’m hungry and worn
And feel that the cares of this world have me torn,
You come as my haven, my rest, and my food—
My cup runneth over with joy!

4
And then in the evening when my thoughts are free,
Remembr’ing that You, Lord, still dwell within me,
This sweet fact releases a river in me—
My cup runneth over with joy!

Nothing’s quite so precious
As Jesus in my spirit.
He takes away the care
And fills me with His peace.
He never leaves me,
Even as the days grow weary.
His presence goes with me.
My soul delights to hide in His arms.

c
I call His name, “Lord Jesus,
Help me in my weakness.”
So faithfully each day in me
He proves His life is so sufficient.                     

2
Nothing’s quite so precious
As Jesus in my spirit.
He turns my heart to Him,
To feast upon His life.
It’s nothing I do—
His mercy’s just upon me.
And God’s free gift of grace
Becomes an endless joy to me.

In the garden of my heart.

Planting flowers of Himself
There to be watered by my love.

I’m loving Jesus, this lovely Person                     
with personality so strong.
He brought me to Himself                     
And said to me, “All of your heart’s
desire is found in Me;
I’m all you need and I love you.”

2
There is a peace within me
That has sprung from deep
Contentment with my Lord,
Who’s All in All.
For my delight is in this Living One
Inside of me Who is,
Himself, my everything.

From the fountain of God’s rich salvation.

When you say, “Lord Jesus!”
You’ve said it all.

Don’t be afraid
When the wind is blowing strong
Don’t be afraid
When the storm’s gone on too long
Don’t be afraid
It’s your Father’s hand you feel
Don’t be afraid
He will take you through the gale

s
For the life He’s put within you
Has outlasted many storms
And won through the wiles of Satan
In all their many forms

s
So be trusting in your Father
In sweet fellowship with Him
For He’s walking on the waters
And He scorns the darkness grim

2
Take courage now
And just look into His face
Don’t fear to step
Through the turmoil of the days
Don’t let your gaze
Drag you down into the waves
Cry out to Him
And you’ll touch His hand of grace

s
Thank You Father, I’m a son of light
Amid a darkened age
Though the enemy is seeking
To devour me in rage

But my life is in the Father
And He is one with me
And His kingdom soon is coming,
Sweet divine reality!

From the morning to the evening,
His faithfulness I see;
His mercy reaching sinners,
reaching even me;
And I know, now I know.                     
Brighter than the brightest sunlight,
all doubts and fears must cease;
Sweeter than the sweetest delight,
His living word in me
And I know, now I know —

c
That God is there for me tomorrow,
as He is for me today;
That He’ll take my cares and sorrow,
and He’ll wipe them all away;
There’s no crisis that He can’t bear,
there’s no storm He can’t abate;
He’s my God, He’s my God.

Day by day His grace grows dearer;
His love has conquered me,
Never leaving, never ceasing,
His Spirit constantly
Flooding me, rich and free;
Higher than the highest heaven,
He lifts me up to see
New Jerusalem descending,
His Bride, His love to be
Eternally, it shall be.

For its skies may turn to gray.

For I know what Jesus said,
And today I’ll walk beside Him,
For He knows what is ahead.

c
Many things about tomorrow,
I don’t seem to understand;
But I know who holds tomorrow,
And I know who holds my hand.

I don’t know about tomorrow,
It may bring me poverty;
But the One who feeds the sparrow,
Is the One who lives in me.
And the path that be my portion,
May be through the flame or flood,
But His presence goes before me,
Bravely His path I will trod.

If, Lord, we gave You a part?

O Lord Jesus, how we need You!
Win us, woo us, to Thyself, Lord,
That we’d ever stay, Lord, with You.

Lord, before time had begun,
We were marked and called out by You.
We had no choice, we were trapped by You, Lord;
We had no place we could run.

3
Some of my friends are so free.
Who could I blame, Lord, but Thee?
I cannot do all the things that they do
Because You set me apart.

Lord, I’m realizing that
Loving You’s a tender trap.
Since You have kissed me, my heart has melted;
All my resistance has cracked.

Keep trusting Jesus, though storms assail,

Rest in His vict’ry, the battle’s won.

O’er the mounts, through valleys I go
And Your grace does ever flow.

Every line conveys reality.
When I pray the words that You breathed out
You become so real to me.

As I read, I pray, as I pray, I read,
Mingling both as one spontaneously.
You respond within with words so sweet,
I repeat these words to Thee.

3
I’m a newborn babe—it’s the milk I need,
Not the knowledge of the dead teaching.
When I eat Your word, it becomes to me
My heart’s joy and rejoicing.

4
Sweeter than honey, precious more than gold;
It will not be void, but as the rain and snow,
It will do Your will—bear the life divine,
Bearing fruit a hundred-fold.

5
When my heart is like a rock so cold,
It’s Your word so strong that hammers stone,
That the grain of life may come to me
And supply me inwardly.

It’s my food, my drink, and my life supply;
I love to eat it every day and night.
I just turn and open up to Him,
And the rivers flow right in.

Into the church, Christ’s home!

1
The new covenant ministry—a ministry of God—
is the ministry of the Spirit who gives life (who gives life)
and of righteousness as the expression of God.

2
The new covenant ministers are persons
Whose hearts have turned to the Lord,
Who are enjoying the Lord as the Spirit,                     
And who are being transformed
Into the image of the Lord
By beholding and reflecting Him.

3
The new covenant ministers are ambassadors of Christ,
Carrying out the ministry of reconciliation
To bring us into God and to make us one with God.

4
The new covenant ministers’ living
Is a living of grace, the experience of grace,                     
Which is the Divine Trinity
Transmitted into us for our enjoyment.

God has called us into the fellowship of His Son,
That we may partake of Christ and enjoy Him
As our unique center and as our God-given portion.
God has called us into the fellowship of His Son.

2
The enjoyment of the crucified Christ
as the life-giving Spirit in our spirit,
Solves all the problems in the church,
And issues in the growth in life,
And issues in the growth in life,
For the building up of the church.
For the building up of the church.

3
The essence of the New Testament is the two spirits–
The divine Spirit and the human spirit –
Mingled together as one spirit.
The essence of the New Testament is the two spirits.

Love is the most excellent way
And prophesying is the excelling gift
For the building up of the church,
For the building up of the church.

He who sows unto his own flesh
Reaps corruption of the flesh (trouble)
He who sows unto the Spirit
Will reap eternal life.

c
God’s not mocked,
Do not be deceived,
For whatever you sow, you will reap,
You will reap what you sow;
Sow the life seed.

Every choice is planting seeds,
So be careful what you sow. (careful)

The fellowship of the eternal life,
the flow of the eternal life within all the believers,
is the reality of the living in the Body of Christ.

We know the Triune God by experiencing and enjoying Him,
as the One who dwells in our spirit
and desires to spread, and desires to spread into our heart.

By the anointing of the all-inclusive compound Spirit,
who is the composition of the Divine Trinity,
we know and enjoy -  the Father and the Son and the Spirit
as our life and life supply, as our life and life supply.

1
There are three kinds of life in our existence today:
There is Bios, the physical, and soul-life, Psuche;
Now the third life is God’s life and its called Zoe;
And we all have to choose what life we’ll live by today.

c
Oh, it’s God in Christ Jesus, through the Spirit today,
Who is flowing within us, flowing through us this way.
We don’t care for the Bios; we don’t want Psuche;
All we want is God’s Zoe life to fill us today.

2
We don’t care for the Bios, we don’t care for the soul.
We don’t care for the cares of life,
world’s pleasure and show.
We don’t care for the pride of life, the flesh and sin—
We say, “No!” to the soul life,
we’ll take God’s life within.

3
Do you know what God’s life is? Well, just listen to this:
It is God in Christ Jesus through the Spirit—no less!
He is flowing within us, He is flowing through—
Hallelujah! He’s moving to make everything new.

4
We have this Life within us, in our spirit today;
To our spirit we turn, O Lord, and take you this way.
We can overcome Bios and the Psuche too;
Hallelujah, the Spirit of the Lord takes us through.

Fallen, in her condition
Israel left her Love.
She was stubborn in her position—
To God she would not come.
Under the Lord’s chastising
She was an unturned cake.
But Jehovah, with love unchanging
Makes Israel His own son—a change to make.

2
You became a man—
Cord of love to me.
I am drawn with loving bands
And embraced by Thee.
From the heavens came,
You stepped out of eternity,
Died and rose as a man                     
That You could impart Your life to me.

The Christian life is a life,
A life of living Christ
For the constitution and building up
Of the Body of Christ;
The Christian life is a life of living Christ.

By obeying the inner operating God.
We need to be conformed to the mold of Christ’s death
By the power of His resurrection that we may attain
To the out resurrection from the dead.

The Christian life is a life,
A life full of Christ
As forbearance but without anxiety;

To be baptized in the Spirit
Is to get into the Spirit
And to be lost in Him.
To drink of the Spirit
Is to take the Spirit in
And have our being saturated with Him.

2
By these two procedures
We are mingled with the Spirit.
To be baptized in the Spirit
Is the initiation of the mingling
And is once for all.

3
To drink the Spirit
Is the accomplishment of the mingling
And is perpetual forever.

1
Man’s Creator has a purpose
For our being here on earth.
In His image we’re created,
To express His rule on earth.
But man fell to Satan’s tempting;
Thus God’s goal was hid from view.
Still our God will have His Kingdom,
For His Son will see it through.

c
Jesus Christ will get His Kingdom
Inspite of Satan and his plans.
He’s getting something real and solid
By growing in the hearts of man.
It’s nothing like religion teaches,
“You have to wait until you die.”
For the Kingdom Christ is building,
Is here on earth before our eyes.

2
His Son, Jesus, is our Savior.
Once in human form He came.
Now as the Spirit He can enter
As the breath of life to man.
As a seed within our spirit
Christ takes root and starts to grow,
Spreading in our inmost being
Till His life we come to know.

3
Time is short, oh brothers hear it.
Christ is longing for His Bride.
We can hasten His returning,
Simply by the growth in life.
No more struggling, no more striving,
Simply turn to Christ within.
See the seed begin to blossom,
Growing fully into Him.

c2
Jesus Christ will get His Kingdom
By growing in a normal way.
It’s not an instant transformation.
This growth goes on from day to day.
The seed of life is all-inclusive.
It’s got everything we’ll ever need.
Yes, our God’s eternal purpose
Is all within this precious seed.

Born of my father, descended from Adam,
A life in my flesh is God’s enemy.
I have inherited God’s condemnation,
Death and sin were reigning in me.

2
But love eternal appeared and He called me,
Out from the lost and hopeless race.
Into His Son now I have been transferred,
Born of the Spirit, into His grace.

3
I am God’s child now, free to enjoy Him.
The Spirit of Life is reigning in me.
Christ is my walking, my living, my breathing,
All that I have and ever will be.

4
Chosen and guided into His purpose,
From individual to corporate man.
Now in His Body, we can experience
All the unlimited grace of His plan.

5
This is the mystery hidden from ages.
For this God brought us from sinner to son.
Practical church life, daily transforming
Into the oneness, God’s expression.

God made me to be a man.
I’m so glad I’m in His plan.
He chose me before the world began—
I’m so happy that I’m a man.                     

c
Look at the many items in the
heaven and earth we see;
Billions of things that He has made;
It’s all for you and me.
I am a vessel made by God,
predestined as His son to be;
He chose me way back
in eternity.                     

2
Satan came to corrupt man,
And spoil God’s wonderful plan.
But our God took on the flesh of man
To die for weak, sinful man.

c2
I never thought the
mighty God became a man like me,
To put on flesh and blood
and lay aside His glory.
He took up all our sins
upon His body to a tree
To redeem us from our sins,
we’re now set free!

3
Christ came in my deepest part—
Into my spirit and heart.
He came in to never leave apart,
Now we have a fresh, new start.
Christ came into my spirit
very, very deep within.

c3
Simply by calling on His name
I have experienced Him.
Christ is my life and person now
in resurrection.
Oh, just call on Him,
He’ll fill you to the brim!

Fill, fill, fill! I’m full of Him.
Joy, joy, joy! Overflowing.
Love, love, love! Coming from Him within.
Oh, I have touched the King!

God has called us for His purpose,
His economy so glorious,
For which He was fully processed;
Consummated now is He.
As the Spirit He indwells us
As our God-allotted portion.
Working out His full salvation,
Making us the same as He is.

c
Oh, may a clear controlling vision of
The Lord’s economy direct my heart
And burn in me until my spirit’s wholly set afire.                     
With spirit strong and active we’ll press on
To consummate God’s goal—
New Jerusalem!  Hallelujah!

2
Jesus lived the God-man pattern,
Set the way for us to follow.
He denied His natural man and
Was obedient unto death.
Once He was the only God-man;
Now we are His duplication.
As the many grains we’re blended
As His corporate reproduction.

3
Living out His resurrection
Dying to the flesh and soul-life,
Living by the mingled spirit,
Natural man we will deny.
Now we’re living in the Body,
Every day we’re overcoming,
Striving for the peak of Zion,
Watching for our Lord’s appearing.

4
God and men will have one living
Always in the mingled spirit;
We two are incorporated—
One organic entity!
This, the vision of the ages,
Will control our daily living,
That the Lord may have His body,
Shining as the holy city.

What miracle! What mystery!
That God and man should blended be!
God became man to make man God,
Untraceable economy!
From His good pleasure, heart’s desire,                     
His highest goal attained will be.
From His good pleasure, heart’s desire,
His highest goal attained will be.                     

2
Flesh He became, the first God-man,
His pleasure that I God may be:
In life and nature I’m God’s kind,
Though Godhead’s His exclusively.
His attributes my virtues are;
His glorious image shines through me.

3
No longer I alone that live,
But God together lives with me.
Built with the saints in the Triune God,
His universal house we’ll be,
And His organic Body we
For His expression corp’rately.

4
Jerusalem, the ultimate,
Of visions the totality;
The Triune God, tripartite man—
A loving pair eternally—
As man yet God they coinhere,
A mutual dwelling place to be;
God’s glory in humanity
Shines forth in splendor radiantly!

The Bible is a romance
In the most holy sense:
God and His chosen people
In love it so presents.
This Universal Couple
Throughout it is displayed;
God in Christ is the Bridegroom,
His saints, the Bride, portrayed.

2
Through shadows, types, and figures,
God’s deepest thought is known;
As typified by Adam,
The Husband, Christ, is shown.
A rib brought forth from Adam
Reveals the source of life
By which God built a woman:
Eve, as the church, His wife.

3
To be His people’s Husband,
To take them as His wife:
This is what God desires
To live in marriage life.
Their sacrifice and worship
Alone could not content;
But with them to be married
Was God’s foremost intent.

4
This romance is the finest
As seen in the Song of Songs;
For her beloved’s kisses
His seeking lover longs.
Love’s work in her produces
No person of her own,
But she becomes the City,
Her Person, Christ alone.

5
Christ is our coming Bridegroom;
We are the Church His Bride,
Redeemed, regenerated,
The issue of His side,
In source, in life, in nature
And person fully one,
His counterpart forever,
The New Jerusalem.

the reality of the tabernacle, and
the consummation of the tabernacle—
reveal the goal of God’s economy to have a corp’rate people

3
The intrinsic element of the work of the divine building
is to minister the building and builded God into others
for the building up of the Body, the Body of Christ
for the building up of the Body, the Body of Christ

Oh listen to a story of abounding grace
Of how our God came down to earth to join the human race
And through His kind intention, He came up with a plan
That He Himself might be expressed by dispensing into man.

c
Oh what a kind intention, oh what abounding grace
How our God came down to earth to join the human race
It surely was a mystery so deep we could not trace
That we might be to the praise of the glory of His grace.

2
For God had predetermined, by His counsel and His will
That man might be a vessel, which He Himself would fill
And so for this He chose us, back in eternity
And He predestinated us His very sons to be.

3
His task, it was not easy, it surely took much grace
When on the earth He first appeared, a man in time and space
And then for 33 long years, He lived out God in Man
That He might fully carry out all of the Father’s plan.

4
At the end of His lifetime, He did a wondrous thing
Went to the cross and shed His blood, redemption to win
This brought us into favour, into a blessed place
For God forgave our offenses by the riches of His grace.

5
Now in the application, the Spirit’s moving in
Applying all the Son has done, forgiving all our sin
He’s sealing God into us, full sonship to bring
Oh, this is the mystery of the universe, and this is why we sing.

Conscience is a test and a check to preserve us in the faith.

Carried out in power by His life;

Since the day that we heard His voice.
Deep within we heard the “Amen”
“This is My choice—you’ll not choose again!”


Calgary Songbook :2505

1
Christ is life—Hallelujah for this!
Wonderful Jesus, He is such a reality!
We can sing and praise His name;
Every day He’s just the same;
Jesus is Lord—this we boldly declare to the world.                     

c
For we know that
When we turn to our spirit, we enjoy Him.
We’ve found the way to release life and say,                     
O Lord Jesus!
Now we meet as the church in every city,
Praising our Lord; He is so wonderful!                     

2
Build us, Lord, in each locality;
Christ and the church shall prevail on the
earth to the end.
When we use the blood, we see
Satan and his hosts must flee.
Jesus our Lord has won for us this
great victory.

3
We express His Body on earth,
Meeting as one on the ground of each locality.
We care Lord just for your life,
No religious forms or strife.
We can rejoice in the church of His choice in this way.

Dearest Lord, You’ve called us here,
And opened up Your heart.
O the joy to hear Your call
And enter in the Ark.
Saving us from day to day,
O Lord, this is Your way.
In Yourself we stay afloat
Above this wicked age today.                     

c
Thank You, Lord, in Your eyes we find grace,
And with open hearts we come to You.                     
Regardless what our friends might say to us or do,
O Lord Jesus, we love You.

2
Seeking of this age to taste,
And of it have a part,
If we only knew, dear Lord,
The way we grieve Your heart,
We would come and turn to You
With a repenting heart,
And would give ourselves to be
With You, O Lord, inside the Ark.

3
Praise You, Lord!  We’re safe in You,
Outside death waters pour.
Many things that I once loved
Are on the ocean floor.
Keep us open to You, Lord;
Don’t let us miss the mark.
Hallelujah, praise the Lord!
We’re here within the church, the Ark.

In the gatherings of the christians
All can prophesy, we’re told
One by one to share and comfort,
Speaking forth for Christ so bold!

c
In the church each saint must function;
This is God’s desire today!
From the least one to the greatest,
Christ expressed in every way!

2
Love that’s free from all pretension;
Giving hospitality;
Some so cheerful showing mercy,
All to pray continually.

3
Some to teach, and some exhorting,
Some to minister and serve,
Some with diligence for “leading”;
Each his function must observe.

4
Some with verse or testimony,
Some with song their Christ can share;
Each with strong and ready spirit,
None in bondage to his chair.

5
For the spirits of the prophets
To the prophets subject are;
Each must exercise his spirit,
Everyone a shining star.

Some, these days, would tell us that our Jesus is not food,
That we only need to know about Him and do good,
But we’re glad to tell you brothers, it’s just not that way—
Jesus is the bread of life; we eat Him every day.

c
We love the church life,
eating, drinking, breathing Jesus.
taking in God’s Word.
We love to hear those
“O Lord, Amen, Hallelujahs!”
We love the church life,
feasting with the Lord.

2
When He fills our inward parts, we’re never quite the same,
So much richness we can taste by calling on His name.
“Services” but once a week for us will never do.
Every day we need the fellowship to take us through.

3
If these latter days and situations of the world
Make you feel that round a vicious circle you are swirled,
Then please listen closely to the things we have to say;
It may be that you will find with us a better way.

Ref:Song of Songs 5:2; 6:4, 10, 13

1
Lovers of Christ in His ascension
Enjoy the riches of His life;
She becomes His private garden
With it’s fountain, fruit and spice;
Christ is hers, and she is Christ’s dear love.

2
She is as beautiful as Tirzah,
As lovely as Jerusalem;
Through her living in Christ’s ascension
Her dear heart is now His home;
She’s become the sanctuary of God.

3
Who is this woman I am seeing,
Shining forth as the moon and sun?
She is absolutely heavn’ly,
From the old creation free;
Overcoming all to live within the veil.

4
An army terrible with banners
Christ’s lovers overcome to be;
Those attracted by His beauty,
Fully trusting in His power,
Her romance is now the dances of two camps.

5
The Shulammite, His duplication!
His counterpart has now become;
She’s the same in life and nature,
His expression to the full;
Consummated as the New Jerusalem!


Calgary Songbook :2603

1
To live a life                     
In the Holy of Holies
We must become a captive of Christ.
Many times, reality is that
Christ is captive to us,
This becomes our own fleshly
Victory.

2
Conquer me,
Subdue me,
That I’d no longer be Your enemy.
Defeat me at any cost
That my own will would be lost.
Your desires make my own.
Never let me win.

3
I’m willing,
Defeat me.
Put the world and sins beneath my feet.
Within me is rebellion
Defeat it, conquer and subdue it.
Carry me away as Your
Captive.

4
Today
There’s a need
For us to become captives.
We will see
The effect on those around us.
So become a little captive,
A living sacrifice,
In the triumph of Christ.

s
But thanks be to God
Who always leads us
In the triumph
In the Christ.

Victory through Christ’s resurrection
The victory is won!
Praise Him for what He has done
The victory is won!

1
The victory over death,
Over Satan and the world
He defeated them triumphantly
For all to see,
Oh, what a victory!

2
Designated as the Son
Bringing man into God
He uplifted humanity
Displayed His glory
Oh, what a victory!

3
He became the Spirit too
So that He could dwell in us
He’s dispensing into you and me
Now He’s life-giving
Oh, what a victory!

4
He regenerated us
Now we’re brothers of the Lord
We’re the members of His family
We’re in the Body
Oh, what a victory!

Now we partake of Him
In His victory we share
He’s available to us daily
In God’s economy
We’re enjoying...

What things were gains to me,
These I now count as loss.
Jesus - has set me free
From what I was!
All of the things I had:
Everything, good or bad,
I count as refuse—
That I may gain Christ!

c
I won’t give up!
I will keep running until
I have attained
The goal of my calling!
I must press on!
I must pursue until I lay hold of Him
Who laid hold of me!

Forget the things behind!
Stretch for the things before!
Press onward with this mind:
Always want more!
Seeking in Him to grow,
Increasingly to know
Him that I daily might
Be found in Christ.

My life for eternity.
All things are just dung compared to Him,
So love and just gain Him!

Where’s the answer?
There must be more for me.
Is this all to life—an empty vanity?                     
Day by day and year by year go by.
Am I just a man, a man just born to die?

c
Where’s the answer? Oh I’m so empty
And plagued by this vanity.                     
Deep inside me, my conscience tells me:
I need another destiny.                     

2
I convince my friends
that everything’s alright,
That my life and future
and everything’s so bright.
But a sense inside me,
my friends, I can’t deny,
Warning deep inside me
that I was living a lie.

3
The world and its glitter left me anxious,
dark and bitter,
Always yearning, my friends
is there something better?
And religion, my friends,
is just a Sunday game—
Dead teachings and doctrines
will leave you just the same.

4
Oh God, where are You?
I need You desperately!
Oh God, who are You?
Why don’t You answer me?
The heavens declare You and the earth
shows Your beauty.
But I’m a man. Oh God, I’m so empty!

c2
Lord, have mercy! I’m crying for You!
Please hear!  Are You really true?
I’m dark and lonely. You’re far,
far from me.
Oh Lord, I need You desperately!

5
One day a friend told me
that Jesus is the Lord.
To my great surprise,
it’s written in the Word.
They asked me to believe You.
Your name I once blasphemed.
Dear Lord, You saved me
just by calling on Your name.

c3
Oh, Lord Jesus, dear Son, so glorious,
I’m cleansed and You enter into me.
Oh, Lord Jesus, Your name most precious!
Your Person, dear Lord, I now possess.


Calgary Songbook :2701

1
From the time I spoke Your name,
Lord, my life’s not been the same,
Since I called on the only One who’d save me.                     
When forsaken, in despair—
Who’d have thought that You’d be there!
Now I’ve found out, Jesus, You’re alive!                     

c
Now my eyes begin to see
I’m living as I ought to be,
As this turning, burning God
moves in my heart.
I don’t care now how I feel;
I just know that this is real,
And I know, O Jesus, You’re alive!                     

2
All my friends might think it’s square,
Since I touched You, I don’t care,
For I’ve found You’re the only life worth living.
Though some mock and criticize,
Lord, they just don’t realize
That I’ve found out, Jesus, You’re alive!

3
It’s no statue that I call,
Not a picture on the wall,
But a person who lives His life within me.
Wish they’d told me long before,
All You want’s an open door,
And that really, Jesus, You’re alive!

Intro: Option 1  
Do you know what you were made for;
Do you ever wonder why?
What’s the purpose for your being;
What’s the reason you’re alive?
Do you know God wants to be your life?
He wants to be your life,
He wants to be your life
He wants to be your life.
You were made with something deep within,
A vessel to contain just Him.

s
Intro: Option 2 
I sought for pleasure and gain,
But found life empty and vain.                     
Christ filled up the gap in my life,                     
Flowing His love within my deepest part,
Flooding my heart,
Until I could only say:
Lord, I  can no longer hold back                     
All of this love that I want to return;
My being burns;
My heart now I turn to You.

s
I cast off all my cares,
All that keeps my heart from loving
and enjoying You.
All I know now is that I’m in love
with You;
And not just for what You do,                     
But I have found my delight In Your eyes,
And my heart cries to be filled with love
for You.

s
Only You, Beloved One,
Sweet Lord, Beloved One.

In man’s labor and his search for meaning
Everything is vanity of Vanities
There is nothing new, there is nothing new,                     
Nothing under the sun, nothing under the sun
Man’s pleasures fail to satisfy                     
Man’s pleasures fail to satisfy.                     

2
God implanted in man’s heart eternity
A divinely implanted sense of a purpose
Working through the ages, working through the ages
Which nothing under the sun, no nothing under the sun
But only God can satisfy
But only God can satisfy.

3
Song of Songs speaks of the King of Majesty
Whose purpose, plan and goal is that He find a bride,
Becoming a country man, pursuing a country girl,
Attracted and charmed by Him, becoming the same as He.
Now she is fully satisfied
And God is fully satisfied.

4
Praise the Triune God who came to be a man,
Constituting man with His divine life,
That we may be made God, in life and in nature
To express Him corp’rately, express Him eternally
Completely satisfying God
Completely satisfying God.

O God of Glory                     
You’ve changed my destiny.
O Lord, Your mercy                     
In love appeared to me.                     
O God of Glory,

In darkness once I groped,
A person with no hope.
But light in darkness shined,
My heart enlightened.
You came to me as Light
And scattered all my night.
Your glory, what a sight!
You made me, Lord, so bright.

3
To You my heart was drawn,
It wasn’t on my own.
Your beauty made me turn
And caused my heart to burn.
You touched my hardened heart
And softened every part.
I saw Your shining face.
Now nothing can erase.

4
I couldn’t, Lord, believe,
But, Lord, You still appeared.
Your life in me conceived,
Dear Lord, I now believe.
You called not being as being
In me conceiving.
Your life transfusing,
I’m now reacting.

c2
O God of Glory,
You’re now my story.
Dear One, I can’t refuse!
By You, I’ve been transfused.

And my conscience has no rest.
Deep within I feel the pain.

In this world of vanity,
As I searched for happiness,
My reward I received just emptiness.

God was far away from me,
Great and highest One is He.
Yet You took on humanity.

Hung on a tree,
Bled there to die for me.

Lord, You were in the temple, teaching all the people
Of Yourself as the life.                     
Meanwhile I was elsewhere, committing
The biggest sin of my life.                     
The Pharisees they found me, dragged me through the street
There midst the people I sat.                     
Teacher, we found this woman committing adultery
We found her there in the act.

c
Great I Am, stooping down.
To the ground so low where I was found.
Where are they who say that you must die today?
Woman, go and sin no more.                     

2
Down from the mountain You came;
I approached You in shame.
I’m a leper, You see.
Sin and rebellion’s in me and I long to be free;
If You’re willing, cleanse me.
My destiny is to die; can You help me survive?
Lord, I know that You can.
All others, Lord, run away, when they come see my face,
Helpless hopeless I am.

c2
Stretching out Your hand unto me,
How my heart was warmed when You touched me
With compassion; moved with love I never knew.
By Your touch to me I’m healed.

3
I down to Jericho went,
Met my robbers who stripped me and left me half dead.
The priests and Levites ’cause they also traveled my way,
Couldn’t help me a bit.
But, Lord, You came to the earth, despised and slandered,
A Samaritan low.
With divinity there and humanity’s care,
Tender and merciful.

c3
Bound my wounds and poured in oil and wine.
Gave Your Spirit to me and life divine.
To the church brought me where care I could receive,
Jesus, You’re my Savior true!

Once I was an empty man,
My destiny in my own hand,                     
Not knowing what my life was reaping.
Sometimes I smiled but inside weeping.
And this emptiness inside still remained.
No peace I gained.
Just emptiness inside me.

2
Even though I knew no way
To help myself or even pray,
Something deep within was seeking,
To know if life on earth had meaning;
And then I found the answer in a name.
I’m not the same,
Since I have called on Jesus.

3
This Jesus lives inside of me—
My Lord, my life, my all to be.
This life and peace inside increases
By calling on the name of Jesus.
There’s nothing for my soul on earth to seek.
I have no need;
I’m satisfied in Jesus.

1
I always knew deep down in me
There was a longing to be free,
A kind of hunger deep inside—
To fill it up, I tried and tried.
There were a lot of things I had;
Some things were good,
Some things were bad.
But all those things of mine before
Don’t satisfy me anymore.
Now life affords a real reward
Whenever I just call “O Lord!”
The Triune God the Spirit is,
And He can fill mine up with His.

2
Thank You, Lord Jesus, for the wine
That I enjoy as life divine.
I thank You, Lord, for mercy all
That opened me to heed Your call.
O Lord, now make Your home my heart
And fully saturate each part.
O Lord, my words just can’t express
The way You’ve filled my emptiness!
O Lord, I know that You will grow
And from my spirit overflow.
Lord, saturate me through and through—
O Lord Jesus, I love You.

3
I always knew deep down in me
There was a longing to be free.
A kind of hunger deep inside—
But now it can be satisfied...
Christ in my heart—the only way
To spread within me day by day.
Lord Jesus!  Lord, I have to say
You’re home in me and home to stay!
O Lord, I know now You will grow
And from my spirit overflow!
Now saturate me through and through!
O Lord Jesus, I love You!

O Lord Jesus, I love You!

There are times in my life,
When my heart is embittered;
There are questions unanswered,
Yet you’re drawing me, to enter                     
Into your blessed sanctuary,                     
And turning my eyes heavenward;                     
The questions of constant enquiry,
Are changed to these words:
Whom do I have in heaven but you,
Dear Jehovah,                     
My flesh and my heart constantly fail;                     
But God’s still                     
The strength of my heart and my portion,                     
To Him forever I’ll draw near;                     
I’ve made Jehovah my sweet refuge,
So now throughout the years,
Turn my view to see you,
How I need to see Jesus;
Though I don’t understand the ways that you take;                     
Lord make me                     
A babe and suckling always praising,                     
Enjoying your worth day by day;                     
Let each experience constitute me,
For your life I’ll display,

I just existed empty, not knowing
what life was for;
Until one day someone told me that
there was something more;
At first I wouldn’t take it—
it seemed too simple to me!

c
Calling His name, “O Lord Jesus!”
Saying, “Amen,” when He speaks.
Filling my spirit with His life.
Filling my whole life with His life.
Flooding my living with His life.
Filling my whole life with His life!

2
But then at length I tried it—
first softly, to myself.
As I called I felt like someone sick
brought back to health.
The flow of life within me, I’d never
felt before.

3
Then as I called on Jesus I felt
that I’d been found!
I was so full; I was calling “Jesus!”
right out loud.
I’d never dreamed that I could know
reality by...

4
And now I’m full and happy, so
satisfied with Him,
Because He has come and filled me
clear up past the brim.
His life is now my portion—
I’ll go on all my life, just...


Calgary Songbook :2712

1
There’s a gospel of today
That says believe and you’ll be saved, and then
You can go to heaven and see the pearly gates
And walk the golden streets.
Words like these fail to treat
All the vanity  that is hidden in me.

2
But the gospel is to me
The Triune God within humanity
As the Spirit reaching me to be in me
The one reality.
Love untold—Gospel Thee
Never getting old—story told eternally.

3
Left the ninety-nine behind—
You searched until the lost sheep You did find.
Laid me on Your shoulders there, You bore me in
Your tender loving care.
Rejoicing—You found me,
Though a small lost sheep—You gave all to come find me.

4
Sweeping in my deepest parts,
You lit a lamp and searched my inward heart,
Sanctifying deep within You shined in me,
Exposed me of my sin.
Repenting—now I see
Lord, You’re sprinkling me with the blood You shed for me.

5
Eagerly awaiting me
That I the slightest turn to Thee would make.
Though my life had been a wreck, You ran to me
And fell upon my neck.
Kissing me affectionately,
Killed the calf for me—“Let us eat and be merry.”

1
Do you know what you were made for;
Do you ever wonder why?
What’s the purpose for your being;
What’s the reason you’re alive?

c
Do you know God wants to your life?
He wants to be your life, He wants to be your life.
You were made with something deep within,
A vessel to contain just Him.                     

2
Deep within you is your spirit,
Even deeper than your “heart”;
Many other things can fill you—
Only Jesus can fill this part.

c2
You have been so empty all these years;
In spite of all you’ve tried, you’re still not satisfied.
Don’t you feel a longing deep within
To open up and take Christ in?

3
Doesn’t matter how you see things,
For in God’s eyes “all have sinned”;
Jesus shed His blood to cleanse you
For the purpose of getting in.

c3
He’s done everything there is to do,
And He’s the Spirit now so He can get in you.
Makes no difference what your past has been;
The living Christ will still come in.

4
Just as you are in your body,
Perfectly contained therein,
God wants you for His container,
All you need to do is let Him in.

c4
Would you open up from deep within
To let the Lord come in and fill you to the brim.
Why not open up from deep within
And call upon the name of Him.


Calgary Songbook :2714

1
The gift of righteousness is measured in abundance,
The depth of His love I’ll never understand.                     
His love reaches me and you;
His mercy goes farther too.
The One on the throne of God is called the Lamb.

c
So, why not open up and call His name, “Oh Lord!”
Find your spirit
where His grace has been outpoured.                     
Call His name, taste His grace,
exercise before His face;
He’s longing and yearning,
He’s hoping and waiting,
He’s ever desiring for you                     
To turn to Him.

2
He knows your deepest thought, your every situation.
He understands your heart,
He knows your history.
There’s nothing in His way,
He’s just waiting for you to say,
“Lord Jesus, my wandering heart I give to Thee.”


Calgary Songbook :2715

1
If you wish to find the Lord, do not seek Him in the world,
For the world is not the place in which He dwells.
In which He dwells, in which He dwells,
In which He dwells, in which He dwells,
For the world is not the place in which He dwells.

2
If you wish to find the Lord, do not seek Him in the mind,
For the mind can only know, it cannot taste.
It cannot taste, it cannot taste,
It cannot taste, it cannot taste,
For the mind can only know, it cannot taste.

3
If you wish to find the Lord, you must open up your heart,
You must open up your heart and let Him in.
Let Him in, let Him in,
Let Him in, let Him in,
You must open up your heart and let Him in.

4
If you wish to let Him in, you just call upon His name,
You just call upon His name and let Him in.
Call His name, call His name,
Call His name, call His name,
You just call upon His name and let Him in.

Fill my cup Lord;                     
I lift it up Lord;
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul.
Bread of Heaven, feed me till I want no more.
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole.

1
Like the woman at the well, I was seeking
For things that could not satisfy.
And then I heard my Savior speaking—
“Draw from My well that never shall run dry.”

2
There are millions in this world who are seeking
For pleasures earthly goods afford.
But none can match the wondrous treasure
That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.

3
So my brother if the things that this
world gives you
Leave hungers that won’t pass away,
My blessed Lord will come and save you
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray—

Open your eyes to the joy of change.
Life is a fruit of God’s creation.
Every new birth is a soul regained.

Drinking His life from a silver fountain.
Sweet water running inside of me.
Oh, how I love to live on the mountain,
Ever since Jesus set me free.

Race for the Son with all your might.
Guard your heart like a gold medallion,
Keep the kingdom full in sight.

Down to earth to bear our shame,
But that’s not all, He lives in me.                     
Once I was blind, but now I see.                     

2
Now through His life we have the flow,
Showing us the way to go;
Keeping us in unity,
And this is His recovery.

3
Now Jesus is the Lord of all;
On His name we all must call.
Then our spirits find release,
And thus our hearts have found real peace.

To wash my sins away.

Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay.

And now I’m walking by the Spirit
Step by step, day by day.
O Lord, I love You.
You’re the precious One to me.
As I do this and that,
Lord, remind me where You’re at:
You’re in my spirit,
Dispensing grace to me.

2
And now I’m walking by the Spirit,
Marching on toward the goal.

Means everything to me.
All self-love I lay aside
For the churches, for Your Bride,
For the fulfillment
Of Your economy.

It is not provoked and does not take account of evil;
It does not rejoice because of unrighteousness,
But rejoices with the truth.

Hopes all things, endures all things.

We have peace with God
Through our Lord, Jesus Christ.
Because the love of God is shed abroad
In our hearts by the Holy Spirit
Which is given, which is given
Unto us, to us, to us.

God had commendeth His love toward us,
In that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us.
