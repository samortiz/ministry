<h2 class="head1">IN CHRIST</h2><p>Some may ask, "Christ was crucified two thousand years ago. How can I be crucified with Him?" First, we must realize that God never asks us to consider ourselves crucified. There are three hundred eighteen chapters of the New Testament. Not a single verse in all of these chapters says that we have to view our crucifixion with Christ through the eyes of our old man. Even the washing of our sins by the blood has nothing to do with us. We have not done anything. It is the Lord who shed the blood and washed away our sins. A man once said, "We should carry our sins to the blood and wash them clean in the blood." But thank the Lord, we do not have to bring our sins to be washed. God washed away our sins two thousand years ago. Once a man selected a hymn in a meeting. The first line said, "I laid my sins upon Jesus." All the missionaries in that meeting wanted to sing that song, but I said I would not sing it, because I could not lay my sins upon Jesus. Then an elderly missionary said, "Jehovah is the One who laid our sins upon Him. We cannot lay our sins upon Him ourselves." Eventually, the hymn was not sung that evening. I hope that it will never be sung again. We have to see that our sins are washed away by the precious blood of the Lord. We have absolutely no part in this washing.</p><p>Suppose one of our friends prays, "Lord, please shed Your blood for me. Please wash away my sins." God could not answer such a prayer. Such a prayer would not save him. We cannot pray a faithless prayer, and we cannot ask God to do something that He has already done. Similarly, if we say, "God, please crucify me," God could not answer such a prayer. God does not crucify us in ourselves. We have to realize that we are crucified with the Lord in Christ. Christ is the second man; we live in Christ, we are saved in Christ, we are forgiven in Christ, and we are crucified together in Christ.</p><p>Adam was the first man, and Christ is the second man (1 Cor. 15:47). In heaven there is only one man, and in hell there is also only one man. In heaven there is only Christ, and in hell there is only Adam. Everyone who is in Christ is in heaven, and everyone who is in Adam is in hell. The whole world equals only two men. Adam was the first man, and Christ is the second man and the last man. We were all in Adam, but we have been transferred into Christ. When I was in Kaifeng, I spoke to some government officials. One of them did not understand the meaning of being in Christ. I explained to him in the way of an illustration: "Most people believe that the Chinese race comes from Hwang-ti. When Hwang-ti fought with his enemy Tzi-you, suppose that Tzi-you had not been killed, but that Hwang-ti had been shot to death by an arrow from Tzi-you. Where would you be today?" He said, "I would not exist." I said, "That is right. In the same way, you have died in Adam, and God has put you into Christ."</p><p>When I was in Chuenchow, a few brothers asked, "How can a man be crucified in Christ? Christ is Christ and we are we. In order for us to be crucified, there must be two crosses, His and ours." I said, "Suppose a pregnant woman sits down on a bus. She only needs to buy one ticket. Although there is a child within her womb, the child is included in the woman, and when the woman buys the ticket, the child buys it as well. In the same way, when we are in Christ, whatever is done to Christ is done to us. There is no need for us to be crucified."</p><p>Someone once asked why he felt that there were times when he was in Christ and times when he was out of Christ. I told him the story of a ten-year-old child whom I once met. The child's mother had been in Amoy over ten years ago. I asked the child, "Have you been to Amoy?" The child answered, "No." I asked again, "Really?" Then he changed his tone and said, "Yes, I have visited Amoy before. I did it in my mother's womb. I have not been there by myself, but within my mother, I have already visited that place." Through this example, he became clear.</p><h2 class="head1">DYING TO SIN IN CHRIST JESUS</h2><p>Romans 6:11 says that in Christ we are dead to sin, but living to God. This verse does not say that in ourselves we are dead to sin and living to God; we are such when we are in Christ. If we look back at ourselves, we will find that our old man has not died. We have to say to the Lord: "I thank You. In You I am dead." Colossians 2:11 says, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ." This verse refers to the circumcision of Christ, which we experience in Him. But how can we be circumcised in Him? We have to realize that the forgiveness of sins comes by faith, not by feeling or sight. Similarly, our circumcision in Christ and our death in Christ are based on faith. Therefore, Colossians 2:12 says, "Through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead." We are crucified with Him through faith. Hence, we have to go to the Lord and say, "Lord, You have said that we are dead in You. I believe that whatever Your Word says will be accomplished."</p><h2 class="head1">BY FAITH</h2><p>From the time I began to work for the Lord until 1927, I preached on the doctrine of co-crucifixion over a period of five years. Yet I really did not know how a person is crucified with Him. One day when I was in Shanghai, the Lord enlightened me and showed me that I am in Him, and that when He died, I also died. I saw that my death is as real as His death, because I was in Him when He died. I saw then that I was truly crucified with Christ. I was upstairs at the time. I ran down in joy and shouted in exhilaration, "Lord, I thank You. I praise You. I have been crucified with You." I saw it, I believed it, and I received it. A full salvation is not one that merely washes away our sins while leaving our old man behind. Thank God, in His full salvation, our sins are forgiven and our old man is crucified.</p><p>What is faith? The Bible speaks of one kind of faith only&mdash;the faith that believes that things have already been done. All the things that I have spoken of tonight will not do us any good if we do not have a living faith. Mark 11:24 says that when we believe that we have received a thing, we will have it. Believing that a thing will happen, must happen, or hopefully will happen does not constitute genuine faith. In our spiritual experience, there are two kinds of "having." One is the "having" in faith, and the other is the "having" in experience. There must first be a "having" in faith before there can be a "having" in experience.</p><p>Most people seek for healing in three ways: (1) for small illnesses, they consult themselves; (2) for more serious illnesses, they consult the doctors; and (3) for very serious illnesses, they consult the preachers. Those who consult preachers for healing in this way have nothing to do with faith at all. Such people hope that God will heal them, instead of believing that God has healed them. You only need to listen to one or two words from a person's mouth, and you can predict whether he will get better or worse. No prayers uttered in the way of a hope will receive any healing. Only prayers that issue from faith will produce experience.</p>
