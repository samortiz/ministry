   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAINTAINING THE DIVINE FELLOWSHIP BY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FULFILLING THE TWO CONDITIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1:5 2:11 we have the conditions of the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first condition is the confessing of our sins, and the second condition is loving God and the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to confess our sins, we need to realize that we still have sin dwelling in our flesh and that it is always possible for us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever we sin, we need to confess our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our confession is based on God s provisions: the blood of Jesus, the faithfulness and righteousness of our faithful and righteous God, the Advocate, and Christ as our propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through these provisions we may enjoy the restoration of our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This restoration of fellowship is wholly based on propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, propitiation is itself the restored fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With propitiation as the basis, we may converse with God, and He with us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We then have two-way traffic for a mutual enjoyment between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the first condition for maintaining the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have emphasized the fact that the second condition is loving God and the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to fulfill this condition, we need to know God continuously and experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not sufficient to know God once in a while, and we do not know Him once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to know Him experientially by continuously living in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our daily life should be a life of knowing God constantly, for our life should be a life of living God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As long as we live God, we shall constantly know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I can testify from experience that whenever I speak, I have the opportunity to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In giving a message my desire is to speak in God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes, however, a certain word may be about to come out of my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then I realize that I need to swallow it, for the very God in whom and with whom I speak regulates what I say.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not want to speak in myself but in God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I cannot tell you how much I have come to know God in the matter of my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever I speak, I know God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Speaking is always a golden opportunity for me to experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would experience and enjoy the divine love and have it become the love by which we love God and others, we need to know God experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the basic requirement for having the love of God become our love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we continually know God in an experiential way, we shall automatically keep the commandments of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we know God, we keep the Lord s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To keep the Lord s commandment means that we take His word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have pointed out that the Lord s word is not merely a command or injunction; it is also a supply of life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord s word always supplies life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This can be proved by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whenever we receive the Lord s word and put it into practice, immediately we have the life supply within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord s word is different from the Mosaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Mosaic law is an injunction with demands and requirements, but without any supply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, whatever the Lord commands us in the New Testament is a supplying word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His life supply backs up His commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His commandment is not merely an injunction requiring us to do something; it is also a word that always supplies whatever it demands.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord s word even supplies us with the Lord Himself as life and as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we may experience Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we know Him, we shall keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By keeping His word we enjoy His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we keep the Lord s word and receive His supply, the love of God will be perfected within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that as we receive the supply of the Lord s word, the love of God becomes our enjoyment, and this enjoyment issues in a love for God and the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we would fulfill the second condition of the divine fellowship the requirement that we love God and the brothers we must know God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we know Him, we shall keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we keep His word, we shall receive His supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the love of God will be perfected in us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our experience and enjoyment of God s love will issue in a love for God and the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the fulfillment of the second requirement for maintaining the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The two conditions of the divine fellowship involve sin on the negative side and love on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the negative side, we need to deal with sin; on the positive side, we need to exercise ourselves to love God and the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, sin must be dealt with, and love must be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we deal with sin and exercise ourselves to love God and the brothers, we shall fulfill the conditions of keeping ourselves in the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
