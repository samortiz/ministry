   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MYSTERIOUS AND WONDERFUL FORM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After His resurrection He came back to the disciples in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was touchable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He had a body, yet in another form, a mysterious and wonderful form which we cannot explain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the Lord Jesus was crucified and buried, all the disciples were fully disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While they were meeting together in the night with the doors closed for fear of the Jews, the Lord Jesus appeared to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not knock at the door, and they did not open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While they were under the threatening of the Jews and while they were so sorrowful, suddenly He appeared among them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Right away He said, "Peace be to you" John 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What a wonderful word!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They had had no peace at all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were sorrowful because of His death, they were also threatened by the Jews to the uttermost, and now they were probably even threatened by His sudden appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So He said to them, "Peace be to you."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He showed them His hands and His side, and the disciples realized He was not a phantom, but that He was their beloved Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What kind of body did the Lord Jesus have?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Was this a physical and material body?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Surely it was because it was touchable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But if it was physical and material how could He come into the room without any opening?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You cannot systematize such a wonderful, mysterious fact in your theology.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was material and physical, yet spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was spiritual, yet material.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was material because He was touchable, and He was spiritual because He came in without the door being opened.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>COINHERENCE WITH GOD FOR HIS EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John 1 the invisible God became a visible flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was good because formerly God was invisible, and now He is visible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, it was not so good because He was limited by being in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He could not enter into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He could not be one with them in a kind of coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He could not live in them that they might live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That was impossible as long as He was in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How could He enter into you and take you as His abode, and how could you enter into Him and take Him as your abode?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as He is in the flesh it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What the Lord wants is a kind of coinherence between Him and you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He wants to live in you so that you may live in Him, and you will live within one another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a kind of coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Coinherence means this one lives in that one, and that one lives in this one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually they are two and yet one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God wants to get into you that you may be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While He abides in you, you abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He and you become one, and yet are still two.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This kind of coinherence is just the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The invisible God became the visible flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet this flesh can never enter into us, so He had to change in form to become in the form of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This spiritual form is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one can figure out how it could be spiritual and yet material, material and yet spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet our very God did become such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He came in, the disciples did not realize at first that it was He.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But then He said, "Peace be to you."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After speaking this He breathed into them and told them to receive the Holy Pneuma, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Air John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After breathing into them He did not say goodbye, and He did not go out of the door.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He simply disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Isn't this wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Actually He had not come to them; He had just appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To say that He came is not so right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He simply appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To say that He left is not right either.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He did not leave, He simply disappeared.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was still there, but within them.</S>
