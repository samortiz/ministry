   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT UNCLEANNESS IN HUMAN BIRTH Scripture Reading: Lev 12; Col 2:11-12; Heb 10:5-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message on chapter twelve we come to the matter of uncleanness in human birth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Leviticus 12 reveals that the very source of our being is unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter eleven tells us to be careful in contacting certain kinds of persons lest we be defiled, but chapter twelve indicates that we are altogether unclean from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Uncleanness is the source from which we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. A WOMAN'S RELATIONSHIP TO HUMAN BIRTH</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first thing we need to consider in Leviticus is woman's relationship to human birth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. In Figure, Woman Representing All Mankind 1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In God's Economy All Mankind Being Female</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In figure, woman represents all mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In God's economy, in His divine dispensation and divine arrangement, all mankind is female.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whereas woman in the Bible represents mankind, man represents God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is the unique male, and all those who are married to Him are females.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Uncleanness within the Woman Signifying the Uncleanness within All Mankind</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The uncleanness within the woman signifies the uncleanness within all mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all, males and females alike, are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. The Human Birth Coming Out of the Woman Being Unclean, Signifying That: 1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Source of All Mankind Is Unclean</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fact that the human birth coming out of the woman is unclean signifies that the source of all mankind is unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since the source is unclean, whatever is born of the source must also be unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are unclean by birth, and now we remain unclean in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not become unclean simply by contacting something unclean; we are unclean already by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were unclean even when we were in our mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, we were born in uncleanness and live in uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No matter how careful we may be, simply because we are a part of mankind we are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only are we unclean we are uncleanness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Human beings are totally unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are under the Lord's enlightenment, under the divine light, we shall realize that from head to toe we are a totality of uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second section of Leviticus shows us not only who we are but also what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, Leviticus requires that we live a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How can uncleanness live a holy life?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Logically speaking, this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is absolutely impossible for uncleanness to live a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, as we shall see, in God's salvation there is the provision for us to live a holy life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Uncleanness of Mankind Is from Within</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In contrast to the uncleanness in diet dealt with in chapter eleven, which is from without, the uncleanness of mankind is from within.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Chapter eleven covers outward uncleanness, but chapter twelve covers inward uncleanness, the uncleanness of our entire being from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Leviticus 12, therefore, goes to the source of uncleanness and touches the root of uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Chapter eleven simply charges us to live a clean life by contacting what is clean and by avoiding what is unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This kind of cleanness is outward; it is a matter of outward conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Chapter twelve, however, touches our birth, not merely our outward conduct following our birth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Leviticus 12 deals with the source from which we came.</S>
