   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN VARIOUS KINDS OF MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Acts 2:14, 40-42; 1 Cor 10:16-17, 21; 11:20, 23-26; 14:26-36; Matt 18:19-20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we covered the principles of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will cover the practice of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the Bible, there are generally five different kinds of meetings the gospel meeting, the bread-breaking meeting, the prayer meeting, the meeting for the exercise of the gifts, and the meeting for the preaching of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible shows us these five kinds of meetings during the apostles time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, if the church is to be strong, it must have these five kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must know how to meet in a proper way in each kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do, we will receive the profit from these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. THE GOSPEL MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the four Gospels, Acts, and the beginning of church history, the gospel meeting was always a very important meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the church had become degraded, by the third and fourth century, the gospel meeting gradually lost its place and was replaced by teaching meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order for the church to be strong, it must recover the place of the gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church exists on earth not only for the purpose of building up itself but also so that others might know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As far as the building up of the church is concerned, the gift of the evangelist can be relegated the last place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, as soon as the church starts to spread out, the gift of the evangelist becomes the first gift.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Philip s journey to Samaria in Acts 8 is a strong proof of this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God first sends evangelists out to gain people to Himself with their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must change our old habit, the habit of meeting only for listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, we must pay much attention to the gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a brother learns to participate in the preaching of the gospel immediately after he believes in the Lord, he will not pick up the habit of sitting in pews and listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, he will pick up the habit of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the gospel meeting everyone should participate actively in the work; no one should sit passively to listen to the message with little concern for the salvation of others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gospel meeting is a time when the whole church is mobilized.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every brother and sister has his or her responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone should pray much before the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those brothers who are more advanced in life and prominent in gifts can serve as the oracles for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The rest of the saints should pray in one accord for the speaking brothers, that the latter may release the gospel with power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is possible to have two or three brothers speaking at one meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But do not try to have more than three.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When there are too many speakers, the audience will be confused.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How should a brother or sister come to a gospel meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, everyone must be clear that the gospel message is not for themselves but for the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This may sound simple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But many brothers and sisters who attend the gospel meeting forget that the testifying brother is not testifying to them but to the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Never come as a spectator, and never come to the meeting in a cold or uncooperative way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not have to be concerned whether the speaking is good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our goal is to save people and to cooperate with the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second, if possible, all the brothers and sisters should attend this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not think that since you are saved you no longer need to go to the gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is true that you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But there are things you can do in the gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You should go to the meeting not to listen to the gospel but to work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one should be lazy in the gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some brothers and sisters say, I already understand everything about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not need to come to such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But coming to the gospel meeting has nothing to do with whether or not you already understand the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You already understand everything about the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why then do you still go?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You must go to the gospel meeting because you need to help the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You also need to go because you have a part in it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Third, every time there is a gospel meeting, you must bring some people to it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Send out invitations to your friends and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Invite them a few days ahead of time or one to two weeks before the meeting is to be held.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes God will give you the grace, and you can bring ten or twenty people to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you have that many, ask others to help you take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Take care of three or four yourself and ask others to take care of the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You should not bring any people to the meeting without taking care of them properly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not arrive at a gospel meeting at the last minute.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the ones who attend the gospel meeting must be well prepared ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Make clear to the ones whom you have invited where you will wait for them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps you should go to their house and escort them to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Always give yourself a little more time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Avoid the situation where the meeting has started and yet your friend has not arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Fourth, after bringing a friend to the meeting, take care of him during the meeting.</S>
