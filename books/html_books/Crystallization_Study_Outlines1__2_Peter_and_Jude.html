<h1 class="title">Living a Christian Life under the Government of God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:17; 2:21-24; 4:17-19; 5:6</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The Epistles of 1 and 2 Peter are on the universal government of God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The subject of 1 Peter is the Christian life under the government of God, showing us the government of God especially in His dealings with His chosen people&mdash;1:2.</li>
	<li>The subject of 2 Peter is the divine provision and the divine government, showing us that as God is governing us, He supplies us with whatever we need&mdash;1:1-4; 3:13.</li>
	<li>God governs by judging; the judgment of God is for the carrying out of His government&mdash;1 Pet. 1:17; 4:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because 1 and 2 Peter are concerned with the government of God, in these Epistles the judgment of God and of the Lord is referred to repeatedly as one of the essential items&mdash;1 Pet. 2:23; 4:5-6, 17; 2 Pet. 2:3-4, 9; 3:7.</li>
		<li>Through various kinds of judgments, the Lord God will clear up the entire universe and purify it so that He may have a new heaven and a new earth for a new universe filled with His righteousness for His delight&mdash;v. 13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The judgment in 1 Peter 1:17, which is carried out by the Father, is not the future judgment but is the present, daily judgment of God&rsquo;s governmental dealings with His children:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Father has regenerated us to produce a holy family&mdash;a holy Father with holy children&mdash;vv. 3, 15, 17.</li>
		<li>As holy children, we should walk in a holy manner of life (vv. 15-16); otherwise, in His government God the Father will become the Judge and will deal with our unholiness&mdash;4:15-17; Heb. 12:9-10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The disciplinary judgment in the government of God begins from the house of God&mdash;1 Pet. 4:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God judges everything that does not match His government; therefore, in this age we, the children of God, are under the daily judgment of God&mdash;1:17.</li>
		<li>God uses fiery ordeals to deal with the believers in the judgment of His governmental administration, which begins from His own house&mdash;4:12, 17.</li>
		<li>The purpose of this judgment is that we would live according to God in spirit&mdash;v. 6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The preciousness of Peter&rsquo;s writings is that he combines the Christian life and God&rsquo;s government, revealing that the Christian life and the government of God go together as a pair&mdash;1 Pet. 1:17; 2:21, 24; 3:15; 4:17; 5:5-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Triune God has passed through a long process in Christ and has become the life-giving Spirit to indwell us; this is for our Christian life&mdash;John 1:14; 14:17; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17.</li>
	<li>At the same time, the Triune God is still the Creator of the universe and its Ruler&mdash;1 Pet. 4:19.</li>
	<li>Although we have been born of God to have a spiritual life and to be a new creation, we are still in the old creation&mdash;John 1:12-13; 3:3, 5-6; 2 Cor. 5:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For this reason, we need God&rsquo;s governmental dealings&mdash;1 Pet. 1:17.</li>
		<li>In order for the Christian life to grow, we need the discipline of God&rsquo;s government&mdash;2:2; 4:17; 2 Pet. 1:5-7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived a human life that was absolutely under the government of God, and He committed everything related to Him to God&rsquo;s government&mdash;John 6:38; 1 Pet. 2:21-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord kept committing all His insults and injuries to Him who judges righteously in His government, the righteous God, to whom He submitted Himself; He put His trust in this righteous One, recognizing His government&mdash;v. 23.</li>
	<li>When God counseled Christ as a man, Christ&rsquo;s inward parts were one with God and instructed Him through His contact with God&mdash;Psa. 16:7; Isa. 50:4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As believers in Christ and children of God, we should live a Christian life under the government of God&mdash;John 3:15; 1:12-13; 1 Pet. 4:13-19; 5:6-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Epistles of Peter reveal the Christ who enables us to take God&rsquo;s governmental dealings administered through sufferings&mdash;1 Pet. 1:6-8; 2:3-4, 19, 21-25; 3:18, 22; 4:1, 15-16; 5:8-9.</li>
	<li>We should pass the time of our sojourning in holy fear, that is, in a healthy, serious caution that leads us to be holy in all our manner of life&mdash;1:15, 17.</li>
	<li>We should be humbled under the mighty hand of God, which carries out the government of God&mdash;5:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In verse 6 <em>the mighty hand of God</em> refers to God&rsquo;s administrating hand seen especially in His judgment&mdash;1:17; 4:17.</li>
		<li>To be humbled under God&rsquo;s mighty hand is to be made humble by God; however, we must cooperate with God&rsquo;s operation and be willing to be made humble, lowly, under His mighty hand&mdash;5:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We should commit our souls to the faithful Creator&mdash;4:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God can preserve our soul, and His loving and faithful care accompanies His justice in His governmental administration.</li>
		<li>While God judges us in His government, He cares for us faithfully in His love; as we are suffering His disciplinary judgment, we should commit our souls to the faithful care of our Creator&mdash;Matt. 10:28; 11:28-29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the death of Christ we have died to sins so that in the resurrection of Christ we might live to righteousness under God&rsquo;s government&mdash;1 Pet. 2:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s government is established upon righteousness (Psa. 89:14a); as God&rsquo;s people living under His government, we must live a righteous life.</li>
		<li>The expression <em>live to righteousness</em> is related to the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s governmental requirements&mdash;1 Pet. 2:24:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We were saved so that we might live rightly under the government of God, that is, in a way that matches the righteous requirements of His government.</li>
			<li>In Christ&rsquo;s death we have been separated from sins, and in His resurrection we have been enlivened so that in our Christian life we might live spontaneously to righteousness under the government of God&mdash;Rom. 6:8, 10-11, 18; Eph. 2:6; John 14:19; 2 Tim. 2:11.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Economy of God in 1 and 2 Peter</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:2-3, 5, 10-12, 20; 2:1-5, 9;<br />
3:4; 4:14; 5:10; 2 Pet. 1:4; 3:13, 18</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In his two Epistles, comprising only eight chapters, Peter covered the entire economy of God, from eternity past before the foundation of the world (1 Pet. 1:2, 20) to the new heavens and the new earth in eternity future (2 Pet. 3:13); he unveiled the crucial things related to God&rsquo;s economy, concerning which things the prophets prophesied and the apostles preached (1 Pet. 1:10-12) from four sides:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>From the side of the Triune God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God the Father chose a people in eternity according to His foreknowledge (vv. 1-2; 2:9) and called them into His glory (5:10; 2 Pet. 1:3).</li>
		<li>Christ, foreknown by God before the foundation of the world but manifested in the last of times (1 Pet. 1:20), has redeemed and saved His chosen people (vv. 18-19, 2) by His vicarious death (2:24; 3:18) through His resurrection in life and ascension in power (1:3; 3:21-22).</li>
		<li>The Spirit, sent from heaven, has sanctified and purified those whom Christ has redeemed (1:2, 12, 22; 4:14)&mdash;the angels long to look into these things (1:12).</li>
		<li>The Triune God&rsquo;s divine power has provided the redeemed ones with all things that relate to life and godliness (2 Pet. 1:3-4) to guard them unto full salvation (1 Pet. 1:5).</li>
		<li>God also disciplines them (5:6) by some of His varied governmental judgments (1:17; 2:23; 4:5-6, 17; 2 Pet. 2:3-4, 9; 3:7), and He will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground them by His all grace (1 Pet. 5:10).</li>
		<li>The Lord is long-suffering toward them that they all may have opportunity to repent unto salvation&mdash;2 Pet. 3:9, 15.</li>
		<li>Then, Christ will appear in glory with His full salvation for His lovers&mdash;1 Pet. 1:5, 7-9, 13; 4:13; 5:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>From the side of the believers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The believers, as God&rsquo;s possession, were chosen by God (1:2; 2:9), called by His glory and virtue (v. 9; 3:9; 2 Pet. 1:3, 10), redeemed by Christ (1 Pet. 1:18-19), regenerated by God through His living word (vv. 3, 23), and saved through the resurrection of Christ (3:21).</li>
		<li>They now are being guarded by the power of God (1:5), are being purified to love one another (v. 22), are growing by feeding on the milk of the word (2:2), are developing in life the spiritual virtues (2 Pet. 1:5-8), and are being transformed and built up into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to serve God (1 Pet. 2:4-5, 9).</li>
		<li>They are God&rsquo;s chosen race, royal priesthood, holy nation, and peculiar people for His private possession to express His virtues&mdash;v. 9.</li>
		<li>They are being disciplined by His governmental judgment (1:17; 2:19-21; 3:9, 14, 17; 4:6, 12-19; 5:6, 9), are living a holy life in an excellent manner and in godliness to glorify Him (1:15; 2:12; 3:1-2), are ministering as good stewards of His varied grace for His glorification through Christ (4:10-11)&mdash;under the elders&rsquo; exemplary shepherding (5:1-4)&mdash;and are expecting and hastening the coming of the Lord (1:13; 2 Pet. 3:12) in order to be richly supplied with an entrance into the eternal kingdom of the Lord (1:11).</li>
		<li>Further, they are expecting the new heavens and new earth, in which righteousness dwells, in eternity (3:13), and they are growing continually in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (v. 18).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>From the side of Satan&mdash;Satan is the believers&rsquo; adversary, the devil, who as a roaring lion is walking about, seeking someone to devour&mdash;1 Pet. 5:8.</li>
	<li>From the side of the universe:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fallen angels were condemned and are awaiting eternal judgment (2 Pet. 2:4); the ancient ungodly world was destroyed by a flood (v. 5; 3:6); the ungodly cities were reduced to ashes (2:6); the false teachers and heretical mockers in the apostasy and mankind in his evil living will all be judged unto destruction (vv. 1, 3, 9-10, 12; 3:3-4, 7; 1 Pet. 4:5); the heavens and the earth will be burned up (2 Pet. 3:7, 10-11); and all the dead men and the demons will be judged (1 Pet. 4:5).</li>
		<li>Then the new heavens and new earth will come as a new universe, in which God&rsquo;s righteousness will dwell for eternity&mdash;2 Pet. 3:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The central focus and basic structure of 1 and 2 Peter are the energizing Triune God operating in His economy to bring His chosen ones into the full enjoyment of the Triune God; our human spirit, as the hidden man of the heart, and God&rsquo;s Spirit, as the Spirit of glory and as the Spirit of Christ, are the means for us to partake of God, in His divine nature, as our portion&mdash;1 Pet. 1:2-3, 5, 11; 2:1-3, 5, 9; 3:4; 4:14; 5:10; 2 Pet. 1:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although the subject of 1 and 2 Peter is God&rsquo;s government, this is not the central focus and basic structure of these Epistles; everything concerning God&rsquo;s government should bring us back to the central focus and basic structure of these Epistles&mdash;the Triune God as our full enjoyment.</li>
	<li>The central focus and basic structure of 1 and 2 Peter are the Triune God operating to accomplish His complete salvation so that we may be regenerated, so that we may feed on His word, and so that we may grow, be transformed, and be built up in order that He may have a dwelling place and in order that we may be glorified to express Him&mdash;1 Pet. 1:23; 2:1-5, 9.</li>
	<li>Peter was bold in admitting that the early apostles, such as John, Paul, and himself (although their style, terminology, utterance, certain aspects of their views, and the way they presented their teachings differed), participated in the same, unique ministry, the ministry of the New Testament&mdash;2 Pet. 1:12-21; 3:2, 15-16; 2 Cor. 3:6, 8-9; 4:1.</li>
	<li>Such a ministry ministers to people, as its focus, the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, who, after passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, dispenses Himself through the redemption of Christ and by the operation of the Holy Spirit into His redeemed people as their unique portion of life and as their life supply and everything, for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the full expression, the fullness, of the Triune God, according to the eternal purpose of the Father&mdash;Acts 2:36; 3:13, 15; 10:36; 1 Pet. 1:2-3, 18-19, 23; 2:2-5, 7, 9, 25; 3:7; 4:10, 17; 5:2, 4, 10; 2 Pet. 1:2-4; 3:18.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Operation of the Triune God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:2-4, 15, 23; 2:19; 4:6;<br />
2 Pet. 1:2, 8; 3:18</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Chapter 1 of 1 Peter, especially verses 2 and 3, reveals the energetic operation of the Triune God to bring God&rsquo;s chosen ones into the participation in the Triune God and into the full enjoyment of Himself:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Triune God passed through a process to do many things for us and become everything to us so that we may partake of Him for our enjoyment&mdash;vv. 18-20, 3.</li>
	<li>The believers were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world, in eternity past; this was done according to the Father&rsquo;s foreknowledge and is carried out in time in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ&mdash;v. 2; Eph. 1:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To foreknow is to foreordain, to ordain beforehand&mdash;Rom. 8:29.</li>
		<li>First Peter 1:20 says that Christ was foreknown, foreordained, and verse 2 says that the believers were chosen according to the foreknowledge, the foreordination, of God; thus, verse 20 matches verse 2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>For Christ to be foreknown before the foundation of the world means that He was foreordained by God&mdash;v. 20.</li>
			<li>The foreknowledge of God in verse 2 implies that in eternity past God approved us, appreciated us, and possessed us.</li>
			<li>At the same time that God foreknew and foreordained Christ, He also foreknew and foreordained all the believers&mdash;vv. 20, 2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification carries out God the Father&rsquo;s selection&mdash;v. 2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In eternity God chose us, making a decision to gain us; in time the Spirit comes to sanctify us, to set us apart, from the world so that we would obey Christ&rsquo;s redemption&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5.</li>
		<li>The sanctification of God the Spirit separates us from the world and causes us to come to ourselves, repent, and turn to God so that we may belong to Him and enjoy His full salvation&mdash;Luke 15:17; John 16:8-11; Acts 20:21; 26:18, 20; Rom. 5:10.</li>
		<li>In 1 Peter 1:2 the sanctification of the Spirit comes before obedience to Christ and faith in His redemption, indicating that the believers&rsquo; obedience unto faith in Christ results from the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctifying work&mdash;Rom. 1:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The issue of the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification is our participation in the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, which is the application of redemption&mdash;1 Pet. 1:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The sanctification of the Spirit brought us to the blood shed by the Savior on the cross and separated us unto this divine provision&mdash;vv. 18-19.</li>
		<li>The sprinkling of Christ&rsquo;s redeeming blood brings the sprinkled believers into the blessing of the new covenant, that is, into the full enjoyment of the Triune God&mdash;Heb. 9:13-14.</li>
		<li>The first thing in God&rsquo;s salvation is to sprinkle us with the blood of the second of the Trinity; thus, we are washed, forgiven, justified, and reconciled to God&mdash;1 Cor. 6:11; Rom. 5:10.</li>
		<li>In 1 Peter 1:2 obedience implies repentance and faith; the sanctification of the Spirit is unto the obedience of repentance and believing; thus, our repentance and believing into Christ result from the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctifying work&mdash;Acts 11:18; John 3:15; 1 Pet. 1:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because of God&rsquo;s choosing, the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctifying, and Christ&rsquo;s redeeming, God the Father has regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&mdash;v. 3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When God regenerated us, He put Christ into us as our life so that we may have the divine life in addition to our human life and have a relationship of life with God&mdash;John 1:12-13; 3:3, 6, 15; 11:25; Rom. 8:16.</li>
		<li>We were regenerated through the living and abiding word of God as the incorruptible seed containing God&rsquo;s life&mdash;1 Pet. 1:23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The threefold description of our inheritance points to the Trinity&mdash;v. 4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Incorruptible</em> refers to the nature of the inheritance; this is God&rsquo;s nature, signified by gold&mdash;v. 7.</li>
		<li><em>Undefiled</em> describes the condition of the inheritance; this condition is related to the sanctifying Spirit.</li>
		<li><em>Unfading</em> refers to the expression of the inheritance; this everlasting expression is related to the Son as the expression of the Father&rsquo;s glory.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God constituted through and with the death and resurrection of Christ for the application and impartation of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection to the believers&mdash;v. 11; John 7:39; Phil. 1:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Although the constituting of the Spirit of Christ is dispensational, constituted dispensationally through and with Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection in the New Testament time, His function is eternal, because He is the eternal Spirit&mdash;Heb. 9:14.</li>
		<li>According to function, there is no difference between the Spirit&rsquo;s work in the prophets and His work in the apostles&mdash;1 Pet. 1:10, 12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Holy One who called us is the Triune God&mdash;the choosing Father, the redeeming Son, and the sanctifying Spirit; the Father regenerated us, the Son redeemed us, and the Spirit sanctifies us so that we may be holy in all our manner of life&mdash;vv. 2-3, 15-16, 18-19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To bless God is to speak well concerning the Triune God and all that He is to us, has done for us, and will do for us&mdash;v. 3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To bless God is not merely to praise Him for what He has done for us or given to us objectively but to speak well of what He is to us subjectively.</li>
	<li>Although the revelation in 1:3-12 is divine, it is something experienced by a human being through the Trinity of the Godhead; Peter&rsquo;s well speaking of the Triune God came from his experience.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to have the consciousness of God and the full knowledge of God&mdash;2:19; 2 Pet. 1:2, 8; 3:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The consciousness of God is the consciousness of one&rsquo;s relation to God, indicating that one is living in an intimate fellowship with God, having and keeping a good and pure conscience toward God&mdash;1 Pet. 2:19; 3:16; 1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 3:9; 2 Tim. 1:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our regenerated spirit has a keen sense toward God, a God-consciousness to deal with God and to sense the things of God&mdash;Rom. 1:9; 9:1.</li>
		<li>To have the consciousness of God is to live in the spirit according to God&mdash;1 Pet. 4:6; Rom. 8:2; 1 John 2:27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The full knowledge of God is an experiential knowledge of God&mdash;2 Pet. 1:2, 8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The full knowledge of the Triune God is for our participation in and enjoyment of His divine life and divine nature&mdash;vv. 3-4.</li>
		<li>In 3:18 the knowledge of the Lord is equal to the truth, the reality of all that He is; hence, to grow in the knowledge of the Lord is to grow by the realization of what Christ is, the realization of the truth&mdash;John 8:32; 17:17.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Full Salvation of the Triune God<br />
and the Salvation of Our Souls</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:5, 9</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The operation of the Triune God produces the full salvation of the Triune God, composed of the Father&rsquo;s regeneration, the Spirit&rsquo;s application, and the Son&rsquo;s redemption&mdash;1 Pet. 1:2-3, 5, 9.</li>
<li>The full salvation of the Triune God comprises many items in three stages:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first stage, the initial stage, is the stage of regeneration:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This stage is composed of redemption, sanctification (positional&mdash;v. 2; 1 Cor. 6:11), justification, reconciliation, and regeneration.</li>
		<li>In this stage God justified us through the redemption of Christ (Rom. 3:24-26) and regenerated us in our spirit with His life by His Spirit (John 3:3-6); thus we received God&rsquo;s eternal salvation (Heb. 5:9) and His eternal life (John 3:15) and became His children (1:12-13), who shall not perish forever (10:28-29).</li>
		<li>This initial salvation has saved us from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from eternal perdition&mdash;3:18, 16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The second stage, the progressing stage, is the stage of transformation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This stage is composed of freedom from sin, sanctification (mainly dispositional&mdash;Rom. 6:19, 22), growth in life, transformation, building up, and maturing.</li>
		<li>In this stage God is freeing us from the dominion of indwelling sin&mdash;the law of sin and of death&mdash;by the law of the Spirit of life, through the subjective working of the effectiveness of the death of Christ in us (vv. 6-7; 7:16-20; 8:2); sanctifying us by His Holy Spirit (15:16) with His holy nature, through His discipline (Heb. 12:10) and His judgment in His own house (1 Pet. 4:17); causing us to grow in His life (1 Cor. 3:6-7); transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6, 17-18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) through the working of all things (Rom. 8:28); building us together into a spiritual house for His dwelling (1 Pet. 2:5; Eph. 2:22); and maturing us in His life (Rev. 14:15) for the completion of His full salvation.</li>
		<li>In this way we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, self, the soul (the natural life), and individualism into maturity in the divine life for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The third stage, the completing stage, is the stage of glorification:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This stage is composed of the redemption (transfiguration) of our body, conformity to the Lord, glorification, the inheritance of God&rsquo;s kingdom, participation in Christ&rsquo;s kingship, and the topmost enjoyment of the Lord.</li>
		<li>In this stage God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body (Rom. 8:23) by transfiguring it into the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory (Phil. 3:21); conform us to the glorious image of His firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29), making us wholly and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body; and glorify us (v. 30), immersing us in His glory (Heb. 2:10) that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom (2 Tim. 4:18; 2 Pet. 1:11), into which He has called us (1 Thes. 2:12), and inherit it as the topmost portion of His blessing (James 2:5; Gal. 5:21)&mdash;even that we may reign with Christ as His co-kings, participating in His kingship over the nations (2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 20:4, 6; 2:26-27; 12:5) and sharing His royal, kingly joy in His divine government (Matt. 25:21, 23).</li>
		<li>In this way our body will be freed from the slavery of corruption of the old creation into the freedom of the glory of God&rsquo;s new creation (Rom. 8:21), and our soul will be delivered out of the realm of trials and sufferings into a new realm, one that is full of glory, and will share in and enjoy all that the Triune God is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained (1 Pet. 1:6; 3:14; 4:12-13; 5:9-10).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The salvation in 1:5 is full salvation, ultimate salvation; it refers specifically to the salvation of our souls from the dispensational punishment of the Lord&rsquo;s governmental dealing at His coming back:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This is the salvation&mdash;the salvation of our souls&mdash;which is ready to be revealed to us at the last time, the grace to be brought to us at the revelation of Christ in glory; the salvation of our souls is the end of our faith&mdash;vv. 9, 13; Matt. 16:27.</li>
	<li>Our soul will be saved from sufferings into the full enjoyment of the Lord at His revelation, His coming back&mdash;25:31:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For this salvation we must deny our soul, our soulish life, with all its pleasures in this age so that we may gain it in the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming age&mdash;10:37-39; 16:24-27; Luke 17:30-33; John 12:25:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To lose the soul-life means to lose the enjoyment of the soul, and to save the soul-life means to preserve the soul in its enjoyment&mdash;Matt. 16:25.</li>
			<li>We will either lose our soul-life today and gain it in the coming age, or save our soul-life today and lose it in the coming age.</li>
			<li>If we would enter into the Lord&rsquo;s joy in the coming age, we need to pay the price in this age by losing our soul-life&mdash;25:21, 23.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>At the Lord&rsquo;s revelation, through His judgment seat, some believers will enter into the joy of the Lord, and some will suffer in weeping and gnashing of teeth&mdash;vv. 21, 23; 24:45-46; 25:30; 24:51.</li>
		<li>To enter into the Lord&rsquo;s joy is the salvation of our souls&mdash;Heb. 10:39:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The saving, or gaining, of our soul depends on how we deal with our soul in following the Lord after we are saved and regenerated.</li>
			<li>If we lose our soul now for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we will save it, and it will be saved, or gained, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back&mdash;Luke 9:24; 1 Pet. 1:9.</li>
			<li>The gaining of the soul will be the reward of the kingdom to the overcoming followers of the Lord&mdash;Heb. 10:35; Matt. 16:22-28.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The power of God is able to guard us unto this salvation so that we may obtain it; the power of God is the cause of our being guarded, and faith is the means through which the power of God becomes effective in guarding us&mdash;1 Pet. 1:5.</li>
	<li>We should eagerly expect this marvelous, full, and ultimate salvation and prepare ourselves for its splendid revelation&mdash;Rom. 8:19, 23.</li>

<h1 class="title">Life and Building in 1 and 2 Peter</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:8; 2:1-5, 9; 2 Pet. 1:3-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The central thought of Peter&rsquo;s Epistles and of the entire Scriptures is life and building&mdash;1 Pet. 1:23; 2:2-5; 2 Pet. 1:3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Life is the Triune God embodied in Christ and realized as the Spirit dispensing Himself into us for our enjoyment, and building is the church, the Body of Christ, God&rsquo;s spiritual house, as the enlargement and expansion of God for the corporate expression of God&mdash;Gen. 2:8-9, 22; Matt. 16:18; Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>Christ, as the seed of life, is the power of life within us that has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness for the building up of the church as the rich surplus of life and the expression of life through the growth and development of life&mdash;2 Pet. 1:3-4; cf. Acts 3:15; <em>Hymns,</em> #203, stanza 4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s goal is to have a spiritual house built up with living stones&mdash;1 Pet. 2:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As life to us, Christ is the incorruptible seed; for God&rsquo;s building, He is the living stone&mdash;1:23; 2:4.</li>
	<li>At Peter&rsquo;s conversion the Lord gave him a new name, Peter&mdash;a stone (John 1:42); and when Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He was the rock&mdash;a stone (Matt. 16:16-18); by these two incidents Peter received the impression that both Christ and His believers are living stones for God&rsquo;s building (1 Pet. 2:4-8; Acts 4:10-12; Isa. 28:16; Zech. 4:7).</li>
	<li>We, the believers in Christ, are living stones as the duplication of Christ through regeneration and transformation; we were created of clay (Rom. 9:21), but at regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growing in us transforms us into living stones (1 Pet. 2:5).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Since God&rsquo;s building is living, it is growing; the actual building up of the church as the house of God is by the believers&rsquo; growth in life&mdash;Eph. 2:21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to grow in life for God&rsquo;s building, we must love the Lord, take heed to our spirit, and guard our heart with all vigilance to stay on the pathway of life&mdash;1 Pet. 1:8; 2:2, 5; 3:4, 15; Prov. 4:18-23; Deut. 10:12; Mark 12:30.</li>
	<li>If we want Christ&rsquo;s life to be unhindered in us, we must experience the breaking of the cross, the killing death of Christ in the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ as the Spirit of glory, so that the following obstacles within us can be dealt with and removed&mdash;1 Pet. 1:11; 4:14; Psa. 139:23-24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Being a Christian means not taking anything other than Christ as our aim; the obstacle to this is not knowing the pathway of life and not taking Christ as our life&mdash;Matt. 7:13-14; Phil. 3:8-14; Col. 3:4; Rom. 8:28-29.</li>
		<li>The second obstacle is hypocrisy; a person&rsquo;s spirituality is not determined by outward appearance but by how he takes care of Christ&mdash;Matt. 6:1-6; 15:7-8; John 5:44; 12:42-43; cf. Josh. 7:21.</li>
		<li>The third obstacle is rebellion; we may be very active and zealous in doing things but still imprison and disobey the living Christ within us by ignoring Him&mdash;Lev. 14:9, 14-18; 11:1-2, 46-47; Rom. 16:17; 1 Cor. 15:33.</li>
		<li>The fourth obstacle is our natural capabilities; if our natural capabilities remain unbroken in us, they will become a problem to Christ&rsquo;s life&mdash;2:14-15; 3:12, 16-17; Jude 19; cf. Lev. 10:1-2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to grow in life for God&rsquo;s building, we must put away &ldquo;all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings&rdquo;&mdash;1 Pet. 2:1.</li>
	<li>In order to grow in life for God&rsquo;s building, we must be nourished with the guileless milk of God&rsquo;s word&mdash;v. 2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The guileless milk is conveyed in the word of God to nourish our inner man through the understanding of our rational mind and is assimilated by our mental faculties&mdash;Rom. 8:6; cf. Deut. 11:18.</li>
		<li>Although the nourishing milk of the word is for the soul through the mind, it eventually nourishes the spirit, making us not soulish but spiritual, suitable for being built up as a spiritual house of God&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 2:15.</li>
		<li>In order to enjoy the milk of the word, to taste God with His goodness in the word, we must receive His word by means of all prayer and muse on His word&mdash;1 Pet. 2:3; Eph. 6:17-18; Psa. 119:15, 23, 48, 78, 99, 148:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To muse on the word is to taste and enjoy it through careful considering&mdash;1 Pet. 2:2-3; Psa. 119:103.</li>
			<li>Prayer, speaking to oneself, and praising the Lord may also be included in musing on the word; to muse on the word is to &ldquo;chew the cud,&rdquo; to receive the word of God through much reconsideration&mdash;Lev. 11:3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>By feeding on Christ as the nourishing milk in the word, we grow unto full salvation, unto maturity through transformation for glorification; salvation in 1 Peter 2:2 is a matter of transformation for God&rsquo;s building.</li>
		<li>We enjoy the &ldquo;milk-Christ&rdquo; to nourish us so that we may be transformed with Him as the &ldquo;stone-Christ&rdquo; and be built up as the &ldquo;Body-Christ,&rdquo; as God&rsquo;s spiritual house into a holy priesthood&mdash;vv. 2-5; 1 Cor. 12:12-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The holy priesthood, the coordinated body of priests, is the built-up spiritual house; God wants a spiritual house for His dwelling and a priestly body, a corporate priesthood, for His service&mdash;1 Pet. 2:5; Exo. 19:5-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We are &ldquo;a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:9)&mdash;<em>chosen race</em> denotes our descent from God; <em>royal priesthood,</em> our service to God; <em>holy nation,</em> our being a community for God; and <em>people acquired for a possession,</em> our preciousness to God.</li>
	<li>Our corporate priestly service is to tell out as the gospel the virtues of the One who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light (v. 9) so that we may &ldquo;offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ&rdquo; (v. 5b); these spiritual sacrifices are:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ as the reality of all the sacrifices of the Old Testament types, such as the burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, and trespass offering&mdash;Lev. 1&mdash;5.</li>
		<li>The sinners saved by our gospel preaching, offered as members of Christ&mdash;Rom. 15:16.</li>
		<li>Our body, our praises, and the things that we do for God&mdash;12:1; Heb. 13:15-16; Phil. 4:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>All our priestly service to the Lord must originate from Him as &ldquo;the God of measure&rdquo; and not from ourselves; all our priestly service must be according to His leading and His limitation, as we allow His death to operate in us, so that His resurrection life can be imparted through us into others&mdash;2 Cor. 10:13; John 12:24; 21:15-22; 2 Sam. 7:18, 25, 27; Luke 1:37-38; <em>Hymns,</em> #907.</li>

Rom. 8:29; Gal. 2:20; 4:19; Eph. 3:16-17a</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>As believers in Christ, we may become a reproduction of Christ as our model&mdash;1 Pet. 2:21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The living of the Lord Jesus under the government of God is a model so that we may follow in His steps by becoming His reproduction&mdash;vv. 21-23; Eph. 4:20-21.</li>
	<li>The Greek word for <em>model</em> in 1 Peter 2:21 denotes a master copy used in the teaching of writing&mdash;a writing copy, an underwriting, for students to use in tracing letters as they learn to draw them:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus has set His life before us as an underwriting for us to copy by tracing and following His steps&mdash;Matt. 11:28-30.</li>
		<li>It is not God&rsquo;s intention that we try to imitate Christ by our own effort; what we need is not imitation but reproduction&mdash;Rom. 8:29; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to become Christ&rsquo;s reproduction, copies of Christ, by a process that involves the riches of the divine life; when this process is completed, we will become a reproduction of Christ&mdash;John 3:15; Eph. 3:8.</li>
	<li>The making of Xerox copies may be used to illustrate what Peter means by Christ being a model for us:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As a model, Christ is the original used in spiritual Xeroxing to make us a reproduction of Himself&mdash;Rom. 8:29.</li>
		<li>In this process the Spirit of Christ is the light, and the riches of the divine life are the inking substance.</li>
		<li>As the &ldquo;paper&rdquo; we are put under the light of the Holy Spirit, and we pass through the inking substance to become a reproduction, a living copy of the original, a reproduction of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to become a reproduction of Christ as our model, we need to experience Christ as the One living in us, being formed in us, and making His home in our hearts&mdash;Gal. 2:20; 4:19; Eph. 3:16-17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The New Testament reveals that Christ is deeply related to our inner being&mdash;Gal. 1:16; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		<li>The pneumatic Christ&mdash;Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;is living in us&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; Gal. 2:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God&rsquo;s economy is that the &ldquo;I&rdquo; be crucified in Christ&rsquo;s death and that Christ live in us in His resurrection&mdash;John 14:19.</li>
			<li>We are one spirit with the Lord, we have one life with Him, and we should now be one person with Him&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; Col. 3:4; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
			<li>Since Christ dwells in us as the Spirit, we need to let Him live in us&mdash;John 14:16-19; Gal. 2:20.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ fully grown in us&mdash;4:19:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ was born into us at the time we repented and believed in Him, then He lives in us in our Christian life, and finally, He will be formed in us at our maturity&mdash;John 1:12-13; 3:15; Gal. 2:20.</li>
			<li>To have Christ formed in us is to allow the all-inclusive Spirit to occupy every part of our inner being, to have Christ fully grown in us&mdash;Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15-16.</li>
			<li>To have Christ formed in us implies that we are being constituted with Christ organically&mdash;Col. 3:10-11.</li>
			<li><em>Formed</em> in Galatians 4:19 corresponds to <em>image</em> in 2 Corinthians 3:18; Christ will be formed in us so that we may express Him in His image.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Christ who lives in us and who is being formed in us is making His home in our hearts&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ wants to make His home deep down in our being; He desires to spread from our spirit to all the parts of our heart.</li>
			<li>The more Christ spreads within us, the more He settles down in us and makes His home in our hearts; in this way He occupies every part of our inner being, possessing these parts and saturating them with Himself so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God&mdash;v. 19b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>As Christ lives in us, is formed in us, and makes His home in our hearts, we become a reproduction of Christ for the corporate expression of God&mdash;Rom. 8:29; 12:4-5; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As we become a reproduction of Christ, we will have a manner of life that expresses the Triune God, and we will be holy in all our manner of life&mdash;1 Pet. 1:15; 2:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The expression of the Triune God from within a believer indicates that such a believer has become a reproduction of Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:20.</li>
	<li>The excellent manner of life&mdash;a life beautiful in its virtues&mdash;is the holy manner of life and the good manner of life in Christ, a life not only for God but filled and saturated with God&mdash;1 Pet. 2:12; 1:15; 3:16.</li>
	<li>A holy manner of life is a life that expresses the holy nature of God&mdash;1:15.</li>
	<li>According to 1:15, we should not merely be holy and live a holy life&mdash;we should become holy in all our manner of life.</li>
	<li>If we would be holy in all our manner of life, we ourselves, the persons, must become holy; our being, our disposition, our entire person, should become holy.</li>
	<li>If we would be holy in all our manner of life, we need to be habitually holy; we need to become a certain kind of person, a person who is holy in constitution.</li>
	<li>In order to be holy in all our manner of life, we need the impartation of the Father&rsquo;s holy nature into us, the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit to make us holy, and God&rsquo;s discipline so that we may partake of His holiness&mdash;vv. 2-3, 15; Heb. 12:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we were regenerated, the Father imparted His holy nature into us as the basic factor for us to be holy in all our manner of life&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3, 15.</li>
		<li>We become holy in all our manner of life through the sanctification of the Spirit; with the Father&rsquo;s holy nature within us as the basis of operation, the Holy Spirit is working on us to make us holy&mdash;v. 2.</li>
		<li>Because we are often disobedient, we need God&rsquo;s discipline; for this reason, Hebrews 12:10 says that God the Father disciplines us so that we may partake of His holiness and become holy even as He is holy&mdash;1 Pet. 1:15-16.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>The prophets in the Old Testament prophesied concerning the grace that was to come unto us&mdash;1 Pet. 1:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Spirit of Christ in the Old Testament prophets made them clear concerning Christ coming as grace to us through His incarnation, His sufferings in His human living and crucifixion, and His glories in His resurrection, ascension, second coming, and reigning for the application of God&rsquo;s full salvation to us&mdash;vv. 5, 9-11; cf.

	</ol></li>
<li><em>Grace with God</em> in 1 Peter 2:19-20 refers to the motivation of the divine life within us and its expression in our living, which becomes in our behavior gracious and acceptable in the eyes of both man and God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Grace as the processed Triune God for our enjoyment becomes our inward motivation and outward expression in our intimate fellowship with God and our consciousness of God; we all have to learn how to have grace, which is to take grace, possess grace, use grace, and apply grace&mdash;Heb. 12:28.</li>

<li>The God of all grace&mdash;who has called the believers into His eternal glory&mdash;perfects, establishes, strengthens, and grounds them through their sufferings; this &ldquo;all grace&rdquo; is the &ldquo;true grace of God,&rdquo; into which the believers should enter and in which they stand&mdash;1 Pet. 5:10, 12.</li>
<li>The true grace of God is the grace in which, together with the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the believers should grow unto His glory both now and unto the day of eternity&mdash;2 Pet. 3:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This is the concluding word of the apostle Peter&rsquo;s writings, indicating that whatever he has written is of, in, by, and through the grace of God.</li>
	<li>The product of the grace in God&rsquo;s economy is the Body of Christ as God&rsquo;s poem to be the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s righteousness in the new heavens and new earth&mdash;Eph. 2:7-10; 2 Pet. 3:13.</li>
	<li>The riches of God&rsquo;s grace, the riches of God Himself for our enjoyment, surpass every limit and will be publicly displayed for eternity&mdash;Eph. 2:7.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Christian Life and Its Sufferings</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 2:11-12, 18-25;<br />
3:15; 4:1-4, 7, 12-16; 5:1-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The purpose of 1 Peter is to establish and strengthen the suffering believers; their sufferings are used to arm them with a mind against the flesh that they may live not in the lusts of men but in the will of God (4:1-2), that they may share the sufferings of Christ and rejoice at the revelation of His glory (vv. 12-19), that they may be witnesses of the sufferings of Christ (5:1), and that they may be perfected, established, strengthened, and grounded for the eternal glory into which God has called them (vv. 8-10).</li>
<li>Christ as the first God-man with His suffering life is a model for us; we need to live a life which is a copy, a reproduction, of the life of Christ that comes from enjoying Him as grace in our sufferings, so that He Himself as the indwelling Spirit, with all the riches of His life, reproduces Himself in us&mdash;2:18-25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His suffering life the Lord was a man of prayer&mdash;Matt. 14:23; Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16; 6:12; 9:28; cf. 1 Pet. 1:13; 4:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He was a man who was one with God&mdash;John 10:30.</li>
		<li>He was a man who lived in the presence of God without ceasing&mdash;Acts 10:38c; John 8:29; 16:32.</li>
		<li>He was a man who trusted in God and not in Himself, under any kind of suffering and persecution&mdash;1 Pet. 2:23b; Luke 23:46.</li>
		<li>He was a man in whom Satan, the ruler of the world, had nothing (no ground, no chance, no hope, and no possibility in anything)&mdash;John 14:30b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the members of His Body, His mass reproduction and duplication, the believers copy the Lord in their spirit, learning from Him according to His model by taking His yoke (the Father&rsquo;s will) and His burden (the work of carrying out the Father&rsquo;s will); such a yoke is easy, not bitter, and such a burden is light, not heavy&mdash;Matt. 11:28-30; 1 Pet. 2:21; Eph. 4:20; 1 Cor. 16:10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When the Lord offered up Himself as a sacrifice on the cross, He bore up our sins in His body on the cross, the true altar for propitiation; in His resurrection as the pneumatic Christ in our spirit, He is now the propitiation place where God meets and speaks with us and the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls to guide us to walk on the paths of righteousness, that is, to live to righteousness by walking according to our spirit&mdash;Rom. 3:25; 1 Pet. 2:24-25; Psa. 80:1; 23:3; Rom. 8:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ was our Redeemer in His death on the tree (1 Pet. 2:24), and now He is our soul&rsquo;s Shepherd and Overseer in the resurrection life within us (v. 25); as such, He is able to guide us and supply us with life that we may follow in His steps according to the model of His suffering (v. 21).</li>
	<li>It is by our holy and excellent manner of life as the reproduction of Christ&rsquo;s life in the midst of trials that the unbelieving ones see our good works &ldquo;with their own eyes&rdquo; and &ldquo;glorify God in the day of His visitation&rdquo;&mdash;the day on which God will look upon His sojourning people, as a shepherd looking upon his wandering sheep, to become the Shepherd and Overseer of their souls; when God pays us a visit, that is the day of visitation&mdash;vv. 11-12, 25; Luke 1:68, 78; 19:44.</li>
	<li>Christ is the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls, shepherding us by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our real person&mdash;1 Pet. 2:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>His shepherding directs our mind, comforts our emotion, and leads and guides our will; He leads us to the right place (just as He led His people to the good land&mdash;signifying the all-inclusive Christ) and guides us to the right spot (just as He guided His people to Mount Zion&mdash;signifying the overcomers as the reality of the Body of Christ)&mdash;Exo. 15:13, 17.</li>
		<li>His shepherding causes us to love Him and love one another so that love prevails in the church life&mdash;1 Pet. 1:8, 22; 2:17; 3:8; 4:8; 2 Pet. 1:7.</li>
		<li>Christ as the Elder, the Overseer, of our souls operates within the proper elders in the church, who are one with Christ to watch over the saints&rsquo; souls in cherishing and nourishing them&mdash;Heb. 13:17; Acts 20:28-31; 1 Pet. 5:2.</li>
		<li>To shepherd the flock of God requires suffering for the Body of Christ as Christ suffered; this will be rewarded with the unfading crown of glory&mdash;Col. 1:24; 1 Pet. 5:1-4; John 21:19; 2 Pet. 1:14; 1 Pet. 4:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to follow the footsteps of Christ to live Christ in our suffering of persecution (1:6-7; 2:18-25; 3:8-17; 4:12-19), we should arm ourselves with the same mind that Christ had in His suffering (v. 1; Phil. 2:5-11):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word <em>arm</em> indicates that the Christian life is a battle; the mind of Christ is a weapon, a part of the armor needed in fighting the battle for God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;1 Pet. 4:1-2; cf. Eph. 6:17-18.</li>
	<li>To live a life that follows the footsteps of Christ, we need a renewed mind (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) to understand and realize the way Christ lived to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose (1 Pet. 2:21-23; 3:18-22).</li>
	<li>Suffering responds to Christ&rsquo;s redemption to deliver us from our vain manner of life by preserving us from a sinful manner of life, from the flood of dissoluteness (4:3-4); to undergo such suffering, mainly from persecution, is God&rsquo;s discipline in His governmental dealing (vv. 6, 17).</li>
	<li>We should rejoice in sharing the sufferings of Christ, not regarding our fiery ordeals as strange, as if a strange thing is happening to us&mdash;vv. 12-13.</li>
	<li>In suffering persecution we must show others that we have Christ as Lord in our hearts, we must be constituted with the truth, and we must take care of our conscience&mdash;3:15-16; 1 John 3:19-20.</li>
	<li>If we are reproached in the name of Christ, we are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon us&mdash;1 Pet. 4:14.</li>
	<li>If we suffer as a Christian, we should not be ashamed but should glorify God in this name&mdash;vv. 15-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A Christian is a man of Christ, one who is one with Christ, not only belonging to Him but also having His life and nature in an organic union with Him, and who is living by Him, even living Him, in his daily life&mdash;2 Cor. 4:7; Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
		<li>If we suffer for being such a person, we should not feel ashamed but should be bold to magnify Christ in our confession by our holy and excellent manner of life to glorify (express) God in this name&mdash;v. 20; 1 Cor. 10:31.</li>

		<li>Their valuation of hierarchical position in comparison to being slaves of the Lord and to one another&mdash;Matt. 20:25-27; 1 Pet. 2:16; 2 Pet. 1:1.</li>
		<li>Their valuation of Christ as the treasure of justice in comparison to earthly treasure&mdash;Job 22:23-28; Matt. 12:18-21; Isa. 42:1-4; 1 Pet. 1:18-20.</li>
		<li>Their valuation of the enjoyment of sin in comparison to the unseen reward&mdash;Heb. 11:24-27; 1 Pet. 1:8-12; 2 Pet. 1:8-11; 2:20-22.</li>

	<li>We need to ask the Lord to grant us the light to have a thorough change in our concept of value so that we will continually choose Christ and all that He is as our super-excelling portion&mdash;Mark 9:7-8; 2 Cor. 2:10; 4:7; 1 Pet. 1:8.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;If you bring out the precious from the worthless, / You will be as My mouth&rdquo;&mdash;Jer. 15:19; cf. v. 16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must treasure the Lord&rsquo;s words more than our apportioned food, tasting the Lord in His word as the reality of the good land flowing with nourishing milk and fresh honey for us to dispense to God&rsquo;s people for their full salvation&mdash;Job 23:12; 1 Pet. 2:2-5; Psa. 119:103; Exo. 3:8; S. S. 4:11a.</li>
		<li>We must treasure the Lord&rsquo;s words more than all earthly riches so that we can speak oracles of God to dispense the unsearchable riches of Christ as the varied grace of God&mdash;Psa. 119:72, 9-16; Eph. 3:8; 2 Cor. 6:10; 1 Pet. 4:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ Himself is the preciousness to His believers&mdash;2:7; Phil. 3:8-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Peter was charmed (attracted and captivated) by the Lord to such an extent that even though he was rebuked by the Lord many times and failed miserably, he still followed the Lord as his Shepherd unto his martyrdom&mdash;Luke 5:8-11; Mark 14:67-72; 16:7; John 21:15-22; 2 Pet. 1:14-15.</li>
	<li>Peter realized that he, James, and John had been admitted into the highest degree of initiation at the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration, admitted to be the initiated spectators of His majesty&mdash;vv. 16-18; cf. 1 Pet. 5:1.</li>
	<li>In His ascension Christ is &ldquo;the Majestic&rdquo; (Isa. 33:21)&mdash;He is our God and Savior (2 Pet. 1:1) and the Lord of all (1 Pet. 3:22; Acts 2:36) as our Judge, our Lawmaker, and our King in God&rsquo;s government (Isa. 33:21-22) in order to dispense Himself into us to be our enjoyment for our full salvation (Rev. 22:1).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The precious stone for God&rsquo;s building is Christ Himself&mdash;1 Pet. 2:4, 6-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, Christ as God&rsquo;s chosen and precious cornerstone saves us to make us living stones and transforms us for the building up of God&rsquo;s spiritual house, His dwelling place&mdash;Acts 4:11-12; Eph. 2:20-22.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>The precious blood of Christ has redeemed us from our vain manner of life&mdash;1 Pet. 1:14, 18-19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s redeeming blood is the blood of the covenant that ushers us into God&rsquo;s presence, into God Himself, and into the full enjoyment of God in His holy nature so that we might be holy in all our manner of life to become His holy priesthood and holy city&mdash;vv. 2, 15-17; Eph. 1:4; Rev. 21:2, 16.</li>
	<li>If we see that we have been redeemed, bought, purchased, with the high price of Christ&rsquo;s precious blood, this realization will cause us to have a holy manner of life with a holy fear&mdash;1 Pet. 1:15-19; Acts 20:28; cf. Isa. 11:2.</li>

	<li>By calling on the precious name of the Lord, we drink of Him as the cup of salvation, enjoying Him as the reality of all the precious and exceedingly great promises of God for the goal of God&rsquo;s building&mdash;Acts 4:10-12; Psa. 116:12-13.</li>
	<li>These precious promises are embodied in the word of God; by pray-reading the promises, we partake of and enjoy the divine nature so that we may grow and develop in life unto the maturity of life to enjoy a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God has allotted to all the believers equally precious faith&mdash;v. 1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Just as the children of Israel were allotted a piece of the good land, God has allotted Christ as faith to us, making our regenerated spirit, the hidden man of our heart, a spirit of faith&mdash;Josh. 13:6; Col. 1:12; 1 Pet. 3:4; 2 Cor. 4:13.</li>
	<li>We all have the same precious faith in quality, but the quantity of faith that we have depends upon how much we contact the living God so that we may have Him increased in us&mdash;Rom. 12:3; Heb. 11:1, 5-6, 27; Col. 2:19.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>We must redeem the time to enjoy Christ as the supreme preciousness of God so that we can be constituted with Him to be men of preciousness as His personal treasure; as we live in His precious presence, enjoying Him as our portion, even as He enjoys us as His treasure, He builds Himself into us to make us His spiritual house and His holy and royal priesthood for the accomplishment of His heart&rsquo;s desire&mdash;2:7; 3:4; Dan. 9:23; 10:11, 19; 2 Cor. 2:10; Psa. 16:5; Exo. 19:4-6; 1 Pet. 2:1-9; 2 Pet. 3:8, 11-12.</li>

	<li>The divine life and the divine nature are inseparable; the divine nature is the substance of the divine life and is within the divine life&mdash;1:1-2; 5:11-13.</li>
	<li>As the children of God, we are God-men, born of God, possessing the life and nature of God, and belonging to the species of God&mdash;3:1; John 1:12-13:

		<li>Whoever believes into the Son of God is born of God and has the right to become a child of God; thus, a believer has the right to partake of, to enjoy, the nature of God&mdash;1:12-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>A partaker of the divine nature is one who enjoys the divine nature and participates in the divine nature&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To partake of the divine nature is to enjoy what God is; to be a partaker of the divine nature is to be a partaker of the riches, the elements, and the constituents of God&rsquo;s being&mdash;1 Pet. 1:8.</li>
		<li>If we would be partakers of the divine nature, we need to live by the divine life within which is the divine nature&mdash;John 1:4; 10:10; 11:25; 6:57b.</li>

	<li>We enjoy the riches of the divine nature through God&rsquo;s precious and exceedingly great promises&mdash;e.g., 2 Cor. 12:9; Matt. 28:20b; Eph. 3:20.</li>
	<li>Being a partaker of the divine nature has a condition&mdash;that we escape the corruption which is in the world by lust; we need to live in the cycle of escaping and partaking and of partaking and escaping&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
	<li>If we enjoy God and partake of the riches of His being, we will be constituted with the divine nature, becoming the same as God in life and nature but not in the Godhead and expressing Him in all that we are and do&mdash;v. 3.</li>

		</ol></li>
	<li>To supply virtue in faith is to develop virtue&mdash;the energy of the divine life issuing in vigorous action&mdash;in the exercise of the equally precious faith; this faith needs to be exercised so that the virtue of the divine life may be developed in the succeeding steps and reach maturity&mdash;v. 5a.</li>
	<li>Virtue needs the bountiful supply of the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord; the knowledge which we should develop in our virtue includes the knowledge of God and of our Savior, the knowledge of God&rsquo;s economy, the knowledge of what faith is, and the knowledge of the divine power, glory, virtue, nature, and life&mdash;v. 5b.</li>

<li>Second Peter 2 shows that this Epistle was written in a time of the church&rsquo;s degradation and apostasy:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Apostasy is a deviation from the right track of God&rsquo;s truth and a falling away from the straight way of God&rsquo;s economy as revealed in the Scriptures; through such apostasy the church became degraded&mdash;2 Thes. 2:3; 1 Tim. 4:1.</li>

		<li>The apostasy distracted the believers from the economy of God by leading them into the human logic of puzzling philosophies&mdash;Col. 2:8:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This did not lead the believers to partake of the tree of life, which gives life, but to participate in the tree of knowledge, which brings in death&mdash;Gen. 2:9, 16-17.</li>
			<li>Through the serpent&rsquo;s questioning and undermining of God&rsquo;s word, the believers, like Eve, can be carried away to the tree of knowledge and be distracted from the simplicity of eating the tree of life&mdash;3:1-6; 2 Cor. 11:2-3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In order to inoculate against this death-poison, Peter first prescribed the divine power as the strongest and most effective antidote&mdash;2 Pet. 1:3:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This power provides the believers with all things related to the generating and supplying divine life and the God-expressing godliness.</li>
			<li>This rich divine provision enables the believers to overcome the satanic apostasy&mdash;1 John 5:4; Rev. 2:14-15, 17, 20, 24, 26-28.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The antidotes used by Peter in dealing with the apostasy are the provision of life and the revelation of truth&mdash;2 Pet. 1:3-21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In verses 3 through 11 Peter used the provision of the divine life for the proper Christian life to inoculate against the apostasy.</li>
	<li>In verses 12 through 21 he used the revelation of the divine truth to inoculate against the heresy in the apostasy&mdash;2:1, footnote 3.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The present truth is the truth that is present with the believers, which they have already received and now possess&mdash;1:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to know the present, up-to-date truth and to uphold the absoluteness of the truth&mdash;John 18:37.</li>
	<li>We need to be clear whether a particular matter is an item of the truth&mdash;8:32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Is calling on the name of the Lord a truth? No, it is not a truth. Calling on the Lord is necessary, and we need to have such a practice in our daily life, but calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is not a truth. Likewise, baptism, presbytery, foot-washing, and pray-reading are not truths&rdquo; (<em>Life-study of Ezra,</em> p. 33).</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Justification by faith is a truth. Regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, transfiguration, being made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;all these are truths&rdquo; (p. 33).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because many basic truths have been given up, even by those who apparently are fundamental believers, there is the need for us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to fight the battle for the truth&mdash;1 Tim. 6:12, 20-21.</li>
	<li>Today, in a time of apostasy, we need to testify the full revelation of the pure Word of God and to fight for the deeper truths revealed in the Word of God, including:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The revelation concerning the eternal economy of God&mdash;Eph. 1:10; 3:9.</li>
		<li>The revelation concerning the Divine Trinity&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 1:4-5.</li>
		<li>The revelation concerning the person and work of the all-inclusive Christ&mdash;Col. 2:9, 16-17; 3:11.</li>
		<li>The revelation concerning the consummated life-giving Spirit&mdash;John 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 22:17.</li>
		<li>The revelation concerning the eternal life of God&mdash;John 3:15-16.</li>
		<li>The revelation concerning the Body of Christ, which is the church of God&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 12:12-13, 27; 10:32.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to know and testify the highest truth: In Christ God became man to make man God in life, nature, constitution, and expression but not in the Godhead so that the redeeming God and the redeemed man can be united, mingled, and incorporated together to become one entity&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;John 1:12-14; 14:20; Rev. 21:2, 10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way of the truth is the path of the Christian life according to the truth, which is the reality of the contents of the New Testament&mdash;2 Pet. 2:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The way of the truth is the straight way; to take the straight way is to live an upright life without crookedness and bias&mdash;v. 15.</li>
	<li>The way of the truth is the way of righteousness; to take the way of righteousness is to live a life that is right with both God and man, a life which, according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, can receive God&rsquo;s governmental judgment for His kingdom of righteousness&mdash;vv. 21, 9; Matt. 5:20; Rom. 14:17.</li>
	<li>The way of the truth is &ldquo;the Way,&rdquo; denoting the Lord&rsquo;s full salvation in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Acts 9:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is the way God dispenses Himself into the believers through Christ&rsquo;s redemption and the Spirit&rsquo;s anointing&mdash;Eph. 1:7; 1 John 2:27.</li>
		<li>It is the way the believers partake of God and enjoy God&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
		<li>It is the way the believers worship God in their spirit by enjoying Him and follow the persecuted Jesus by being one with Him&mdash;John 4:24; Heb. 13:12-13.</li>
		<li>It is the way the believers are brought into the church and built up into the Body of Christ to bear the testimony of Jesus&mdash;1 Cor. 1:2; 12:27; Rev. 1:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To take the way of the truth is to purify our souls by obedience to the truth; this is the sanctifying truth, which is God&rsquo;s word of reality&mdash;1 Pet. 1:22; John 17:17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The purifying of our souls by obedience to the truth causes our entire being to be concentrated on God that we may love Him with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind&mdash;Mark 12:30.</li>
		<li>Such a purifying of our souls issues in unfeigned brotherly love, that is, in our loving from the heart fervently those whom God loves&mdash;1 John 5:1.</li>

<h1 class="title">Contending for the Faith,<br />
Enjoying the Blessed Trinity, and<br />
Taking the Way of Rapture<br />
by Giving Heed to the Prophetic Word</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Jude 1-3, 11-14, 19-21, 24-25;<br />
2 Pet. 1:19-21</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Jude exhorts us to earnestly contend for the faith&mdash;Jude 1-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;The faith&rdquo; in Jude is not subjective faith as our believing but objective faith as our belief, referring to the things we believe in, the contents of the New Testament as our faith, in which we believe for our common salvation&mdash;Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 1:19; 3:9; 4:1; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim. 3:8; 4:7; Titus 1:13.</li>
	<li>Our Christian faith is composed of our belief concerning the Bible, God, Christ, the work of Christ, salvation, and the church; all real Christians do not have any disputations about these items&mdash;Eph. 4:13.</li>
	<li>This faith, not any doctrine, has been delivered once for all to the saints; for this faith we should earnestly contend&mdash;1 Tim. 6:12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We build up ourselves on the foundation of this most holy faith by enjoying the entire Blessed Trinity so that we may become the New Jerusalem as the totality of the eternal life&mdash;Jude 19-21; cf. John 4:14b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jude&rsquo;s word concerning building up ourselves upon our most holy faith is equal to Peter&rsquo;s word about being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;Jude 20; 1 Pet. 2:5; Rev. 21:3, 22; 22:3.</li>
	<li>In order to enjoy the Divine Trinity for God&rsquo;s building, we must not be like &ldquo;those who make divisions, soulish, having no spirit&rdquo;&mdash;Jude 19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A soulish man is a natural man, one who allows his soul to dominate his entire being and who lives by his soul, ignoring his spirit, not using his spirit, and even behaving as if he did not have a spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 2:14.</li>
		<li>The Lord desires that all His believers take His grace to be a spiritual man, one who denies his soul and does not live by his soul but allows his spirit to dominate his entire being&mdash;v. 15; Rom. 8:6; 2 Cor. 2:12-14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The entire Blessed Trinity is employed and enjoyed by us as we exercise our spirit by &ldquo;praying in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; to keep ourselves &ldquo;in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life&rdquo;&mdash;Jude 20-21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Unto eternal life,</em> or <em>into eternal life</em> (John 4:14b), is a particular expression; <em>unto,</em> or <em>into,</em> speaks of destination and also means &ldquo;to become.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>By exercising our spirit to enjoy the Blessed Trinity, we become the New Jerusalem as the totality of the eternal life&mdash;Rev. 22:1-2a; 21:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As we live in the Triune God by enjoying Him, we keep ourselves from the way of Cain, the error of Balaam, and the rebellion of Korah to take the way of rapture, the way of Enoch and the overcomers&mdash;Jude 11-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The way of Cain is the way of religiously serving God according to one&rsquo;s own will, heretically rejecting the redemption by blood required and ordained by God, and according to the flesh envying God&rsquo;s true people because of their faithful testimony to God&mdash;Gen. 4:2-8.</li>
	<li>The error of Balaam is the error of teaching wrong doctrine for reward, while knowing it to be contrary to the truth and against the people of God, and abusively using the influence of certain gifts to lead the people of God astray from the pure worship of the Lord to idolatrous worship; coveting for reward will cause the coveting ones to rush headlong into the error of Balaam&mdash;Num. 22:7, 21; 31:16; Rev. 2:14; cf. 2 Kings 5:20-27.</li>
	<li>The rebellion of Korah is rebellion against God&rsquo;s deputy authority in His government and against His word spoken by His deputy (such as Moses); such rebellion brings in destruction&mdash;Num. 16:1-40; Rom. 16:17.</li>
	<li>The way of Enoch, who prophesied concerning the Lord coming back with His overcomers to execute His governmental judgment (Jude 14-15; Joel 3:11), is the way of rapture, the way to escape death and obtain the testimony of being well pleasing to God by walking with God (Gen. 5:22-24; Heb. 11:5-6):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To walk with God is not to override God, not to be presumptuous, not to do things according to our own concept and desire, not to do things according to the current of the age, and not to do anything without God.</li>
		<li>To walk with God is to take Him as our center and everything, to live and do things according to God and with God, according to His revelation and leading, and to do everything with Him&mdash;cf. Matt. 1:23.</li>
		<li>Enoch continually walked upward with God day and night for three centuries, becoming closer to God and more one with God each day until &ldquo;he was not, for God took him&rdquo;&mdash;Gen. 5:24; cf. S. S. 8:5-6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We must give heed to the prophetic word of the Scriptures as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in our hearts; God&rsquo;s word shines in our darkness to save us from being &ldquo;wandering stars&rdquo; and to constitute us into living stars, bearing the living testimony of Jesus&mdash;2 Pet. 1:19-21; Jude 13; Rev. 1:20; 2:28:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The wandering stars are those who are not solidly fixed in the unchanging truths of the heavenly revelation but are wandering about among God&rsquo;s starlike people&mdash;Jude 12-13.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s faithful followers are shining and living stars, those who follow the heavenly, living, up-to-date, and instant vision of Christ as the shining and living Star&mdash;Num. 24:17; Rev. 22:16-17; Matt. 2:2-12; Dan. 12:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The living stars are the messengers of the churches, those who enjoy the pneumatic Christ as the Messenger of God and as the fresh message from God so that they can dispense the fresh and present Christ into the people of God for the testimony of Jesus&mdash;Rev. 1:20; 2:1; 3:1; Mal. 3:1-3.</li>
		<li>The living stars are those who bless God&rsquo;s people; the more we praise the Lord for God&rsquo;s people and speak positively concerning the church in faith, the more we receive God&rsquo;s blessing, but those who speak negatively put themselves under a curse&mdash;Num. 24:9b; Gen. 12:2-3; 22:17; Matt. 12:34-37.</li>
		<li>The living stars have &ldquo;great resolutions in heart&rdquo; and &ldquo;great searchings of heart&rdquo;; they are lovers of God, who are like the stars who fought &ldquo;from their courses,&rdquo; fighting together with God against His enemy so that they may be &ldquo;like the sun / When it rises in its might&rdquo;&mdash;Judg. 5:15-16, 20, 31; Dan. 11:32; Matt. 13:43.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<li>As we are contending for the faith, enjoying the Blessed Trinity, and taking the way of rapture by giving heed to the prophetic word, our trust is in our precious Lord and God as the One who is able to guard us from stumbling and to set us before His glory without blemish in exultation; we give all our praise to Him&mdash;&ldquo;To the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory, majesty, might, and authority before all time and now and unto all eternity. Amen&rdquo;&mdash;Jude 24-25; Zech. 2:8; Psa. 17:8; Deut. 32:10; 1 Pet. 1:5; 2 Tim. 1:12; cf. 1 Pet. 4:19.</li>
