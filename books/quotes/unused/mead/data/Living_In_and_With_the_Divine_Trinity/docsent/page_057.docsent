   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Second Corinthians 5 goes on to show us that God has wrought us for our transfiguration with the Spirit as the pledge vv.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 17 says that we are a new creation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians know this verse, but they do not know the real significance of this term the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to realize that we were not only regenerated but also re-created.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We were regenerated to be a new man and re-created to be a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are in another creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not belong to the old creation, and we are not in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we are in the new creation as a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, 2 Corinthians reveals that we need to express the virtues of Christ as meekness, forbearance, and truth 10:1; 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our Christian virtues are a product of the divine virtues of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The five metaphors that we have seen in 2 Corinthians 2 4 are great items, whereas the virtues of Christ mentioned in chapters ten and eleven may be considered as small items.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows that the all-inclusive Christ covers not only big items but also the small, fine items of the Christian virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Life-study of Philippians, we gave seven messages on the subject of forbearance see messages fifty-six through sixty-two of the Life-study of Philippians, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>489-549 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In those messages, I contrasted forbearance with anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we would have forbearance, we must be released from anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is difficult to express the real meaning of the Greek word for forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This word means reasonableness, considerateness, and consideration in dealing with others, without strictness of legal right.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This implies that we can fit in any kind of situation to meet the need of any kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It means that we are humble, that we can give in to others, and that we are able to fit any situation and any circumstance with anybody.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A forbearing person can fit in with both the older generation and the younger generation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Forbearance seemingly is a small virtue, but actually it is great.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are forbearing persons, we are great persons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I easily lose my temper when someone makes a mistake, am I a great person?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we lose our temper in this way, we are small persons.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A great person embraces all kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A forbearing person, a great person, can even embrace the ones who oppose him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus charged us in Matthew 5:44 to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the expression of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have seen some saints who have been offended and would never forget that offense.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some wives never forget how their husbands have offended them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the biblical sense, to forgive is to forget.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without forgetting, forgiving means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not forget others' offenses, this means we have not forgiven them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Forgiving is forgetting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When God forgives us, He washes away the stain of our sin Psa 51:7; 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, He remembers our sins no more Heb 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to be one with our God to forgive people to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A new church in a new locality is always sweet, and the church life there is in the "honeymoon stage."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, after the church has been there for ten years, the offenses accumulate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This mountain of offenses can kill the entire church life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among all the local churches on this earth, it is hard to find one that has been existing for over five years without the accumulation of offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These offenses are a big stumbling block.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to stop to move this stumbling block, this mountain, out of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we can drive on, and the church life can go on.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why is it that a couple can be married for many years, and yet they become separated and then divorced?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is because of the accumulated offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The husband offends the wife, and the wife offends the husband again and again with no mutual forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This accumulation of offenses leads to separation and then divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is divorce because there is no forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be proper Christians, we need forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Forbearance implies forgiveness, lowliness, giving in, and fitting in with others under any kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul told us that he had the meekness and forbearance of Christ because he had been attached to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul realized that he was one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because of this, Paul also realized that he had the virtues of Christ's human life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul not only enjoyed Christ's divinity in great things but also enjoyed His humanity in the detailed items of Christ's human virtues based upon the divine attributes.</S>
