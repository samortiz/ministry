   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO KNOW GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DEALING WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND BEING DEALT WITH BY GOD 2 Issue No. 28 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:7; 12:8; Matt 26:44</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we will continue to consider the matter of knowing God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We will consider how we can learn to deal with God and how to be dealt with by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, we will learn how to have dealings with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Last time I mentioned only one aspect, which was how to deal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That was not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should learn, step by step, to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we know nothing about God's nature and how to communicate with Him, it will be impossible to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today I want to mention two items: one is learning to know God through prayer, and the other is learning to know God through His will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>LEARNING TO KNOW GOD THROUGH PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One matter that causes many Christians to grope in darkness is that they do not know how to receive answers to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every Christian has a desire that God would listen to his prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If God listens to your prayers only once every three to five years or once every three to five months, you are what can be considered as an abnormal Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many people barely have even one answer to their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not mean that they do not pray; I mean that their prayers produce no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many believers have no assurance about the things they pray for.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They do not know whether or not God will answer their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As time passes by, if they get what they pray for, they say that God has answered their prayers; if not, they say that God has not answered their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have no assurance at all from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should be very rich, but because we do not know how to pray, we become very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How poor that God only answers our prayers once every three to five years!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have mentioned many times that we cannot live a life in which God does not answer our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this is the case, we have indeed fallen into an extremely poor condition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today I would like to talk about how a Christian should pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How long should we pray before we obtain God's answer?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What kind of assurance should we have after we pray, and what should the results be?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is the basis for this kind of knowledge?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It comes from our knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you ask anyone these questions, he may tell you that you should pray to remove sin, that prayer should be with faith, or that you should pray according to God's will, etc. He may give many doctrines about prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, many people understand prayer only through the Bible; they never understand prayer before God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They read the Bible and know the conditions for God to answer their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But it is of little use to only have knowledge from the Bible without knowledge that is learned by dealing with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must spend time before God to learn to deal with Him and to be dealt with by Him; only then will we know God's requirements concerning prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Knowing God through prayer does not come by accident or by learning from others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Neither does it come by listening to my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A travel guide can only direct you to a place; he can never bring you there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do not go, you will never have any experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers and sisters, suppose you have a desire or a request for God to fulfill, and you begin to pray for it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While you pray, you may or may not be very enthusiastic, and you may or may not have spent much time praying.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But what is most interesting is that you never consider that you should know God through your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You do not care whether or not God answers your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, you may ask God for a book.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day God may indeed give you the book.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You will think that God has answered your prayer and then forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, you should realize that you have not just received a book, but something more, which is the knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Oh, only after you know how to ask will God answer!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Receiving the book is not the most important thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The precious thing is the acquisition of the knowledge of how God answers prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By praying this way, you are brought on further in the knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our knowledge should not only be from the Bible, but should also be from God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>REMOVING BARRIERS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose you ask God for another book and after four or five days, He has not given it to you; after two months God still has not given it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If after three or four months God still has not answered your prayer, and you do not know why, you must have a seeking and searching heart to ask Him why He answered your prayer the first time but not this time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You must find the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The problem must not be on God's side.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has no lack, and He has the power to accomplish your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The problem is definitely on your side.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You ought to put aside the matter of asking for the book and search for the reason that there is no answer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You can ask God, saying, "God!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have asked You for a book.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Why do You not give it to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When you earnestly seek and ask God to show you, God will tell you to deal with this and that matter before He will answer your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After you have dealt with these matters, God will give you the book after three to five days.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But by then you have not just received a book, but something deeper the knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This knowledge will cause you to not pray as before.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You will know that you have to remove the barriers before God will answer your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All the knowledge we acquire from God comes by some amount of laboring; we cannot acquire this knowledge simply by reading or listening.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we learn how to deal with God and how to be dealt with by God in everything, that is, if we learn to have dealings with God in everything, we will know what God wants from us, what He wants to remove from us, and what He wants to accomplish in us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way we will know God, and God will be known by us.</S>
