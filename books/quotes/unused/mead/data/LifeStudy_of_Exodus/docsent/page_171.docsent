   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Righteous</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Ten Commandments also reveal that our God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because He is righteous, He will visit those who hate Him for three or four generations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If He failed to do this, He would not be a righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He must act in this way in order to indicate that He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you hate Him, He will deal with you according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the same time, however, He is merciful and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>E. Truthful</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Exodus 20:16 says, Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This commandment reveals that God is truthful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To refrain from bearing false witness means that we must speak the truth and not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This commandment is concerned with lies that damage others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It indicates that we must be honest and truthful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who tell lies are in darkness, but those who speak the truth are in light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the truthful God, God is the God of light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are even told that He Himself is light and that with Him there is no darkness at all 1 John 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that with God there is no falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan, on the contrary, is the father of lies John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As such, he is the god of darkness and the power of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With Satan there is no truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, Satan is of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But with our God there is both faithfulness and truthfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because He is light, He cannot lie.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Light is the source of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we dig into the depths of these verses, we shall see that light is implied with the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, these ten words are words of light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This divine law is full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same is true even of man-made laws.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If in a city or country there were no laws, that city or country would be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But where there is law, there is light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Law always enlightens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It makes a person s situation clear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s ten words, the Ten Commandments, are words of light, and they imply that our God is a God of light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With Him there is no falsehood and there are no shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In every respect He is truthful, for He is light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If sinners would come to the ten words of God recorded in Exodus 20, they would see light and be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose a certain person has stolen a number of items.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When such a one reads the commandment about stealing, he will be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The divine law will shine upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ten words enlighten us with the light which comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Oh, the Ten Commandments are certainly a revelation of our God!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we get into the depths of these ten words, we see that God is jealous, holy, loving, righteous, and truthful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>F. Pure</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These words also reveal that God is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His purity touches our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whereas the first nine commandments are related to outward conduct, the tenth is related to the sin hidden within us, mainly in our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, the first commandment is also related to our inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To have another God besides the true God is primarily an inward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, to make an image or likeness of something is an outward deed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, the first commandment touches our inward condition, and the commandment about coveting likewise touches our inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first and the last commandment together expose the idolatry and covetousness within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Inwardly we are filled with idols and coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Colossians 3:5 says that covetousness is idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul refers to covetousness in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more he tried to stop coveting, the more covetousness was awakened within him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, in Romans 7 Paul was not concerned with outward deeds, but with the inward problem of covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The fact that we are covetous indicates that we are not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only God is pure, for those who are pure do not covet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We covet because we are impure and unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If our heart, desire, and intention were pure in every way, we would not be covetous.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The commandment about coveting reveals God s purity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Under the light of this commandment, we all need to see that inwardly we are not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all have a certain amount of covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But because God is pure, with Him there is no covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because the law is a revelation of God, it is God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to 31:18, the two tables of stone on which the Ten Commandments were written are called the two tables of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This indicates that the law was God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the tables of the law were put into the ark, the testimony was put in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Furthermore, the manna in the golden pot was placed in front of the tables of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, we are told in 16:34 that it was laid up before the Testimony to be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This proves that the law was the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Psalms 19:7 is a further indication of this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Here, in the parallelism often found in Hebrew poetry, we are told, The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The law of the Lord is thus the testimony of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As the Lord s testimony, the law testifies of what kind of God our Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Because the law, God s testimony, was placed in the ark, the ark was called the ark of testimony 25:21-22; 26:33-34 ; and because the ark was in the tabernacle, the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of the testimony 38:21; Num 1:50, 53 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The law was the testimony, the ark was the ark of testimony, and the tabernacle was the tabernacle of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The law is a type, a figure, of Christ who speaks God, describes God, and expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The law is, therefore, a type of Christ as God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is crucial for us to see that the law is a testimony which reveals God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As a type of Christ, it typifies Christ as God s testimony, the One who describes God and expresses Him in a full and adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As the law is the ten words of God which reveal God to His people, so Christ is the Word of God revealing God to us.</S>
