We have to sing, "Praising You for what is past and trusting You for what is in the future."</p><p>This issue is still being published and mailed from Hankow, because Hankow is centrally located among the mail routes. If Hankow is in danger, we do not know where we will move; we are still waiting for the Lord's guidance! If your mail cannot reach us and you do not know where we are, please forward your mail to either Hong Kong or Chungking. If you are sending money, please mail it to Chungking only, because the exchange rate in Hong Kong may cause some loss. If you are sending mail through someone else, please take care of the following:</p><p>Postal Rule No. 144 says that no mail should contain any correspondence to anyone other than the residents of the address and others living in their house. Old letters and old postcards are not affected by this rule. Please write on the envelope the name of the person the letter is addressed to. For example, if you want to send a letter to Ruth Lee via Hong Kong, you should write on the envelope that it is for Ruth Lee in care of Mr. Ho Nai-yee in Hong Kong. If three persons live together in a house and you are writing to one of them, you can include letters to the other two in the same envelope. Of course it is better to write the names of the other two on the envelope as well. But if two of them live in another house, even though they are in Chungking, their letters must be sent in separate envelopes. If a few persons write to one person, it is alright to put all the letters in one envelope. If we are to abide by the postal rule, we have to spend a little more time and money.</p><p>If you live far from Chungking, the mail will take time, and you should send your letter by air mail.</p><p>Recently we received an air mail letter from two brothers, Hwei Dian-chen and Lee Yi-tse in northern Kiangsu who told us that the post office can handle money under a hundred dollars. We have to praise the Lord for this. From the letter of Brother Ho Chi-chen of Tai-Ho County of Anhwei, we know that the brothers and sisters in Shu County are safe.</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />Mountain village in Wan County,<br />July 28, 1938</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
