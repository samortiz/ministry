   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE FIVE HEIRS OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hebrews is a special book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the New Testament there is only one other book in the same category as Hebrews the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I myself strongly believe that Hebrews was written by the apostle Paul because at the end of the letter he mentions Timothy 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul wrote at least thirteen Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among all the Epistles in the New Testament, Hebrews stands out in a very peculiar way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not common; it is quite unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among all the other books of the Bible, Revelation also stands out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both Hebrews and Revelation are revelations of Christ, revealing Christ in special and particular ways.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many aspects of Christ can only be seen in Hebrews, and other particular aspects of Him can only be found in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two books are high, deep, and profound in their revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because of this, they are closed to most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although many Christians can talk about the stories in the four gospels, justification by faith, and things such as head covering, the Lord s table, and the manifestation of the gifts, they cannot touch the depth of Hebrews and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some deal with the book of Revelation in the way of talking about horns, beasts, horses, scorpions, locusts, and frogs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Others discuss it in a higher way, talking about the length of the tribulation or the time of the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But I have never heard people talk about it in the way of Christ being revealed so particularly in God s administration, or in the way of the local churches being the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since my youth, I have heard many messages on Revelation, but I have never heard anyone say that Revelation begins with seven golden lampstands and concludes with a unique lampstand, a golden mountain, holding Christ as the lamp shining with God s light for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We praise the Lord that in His mercy He has opened up these books to us in these last days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has opened up the depths of His Christ in these books.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not call your attention to Hebrews and Revelation because these books are deep in doctrine, but because they are profound in the unveiling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In no other books can we see Christ in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ, our dear Lord, is a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is marvelous, far beyond our understanding and utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We simply cannot utter His profoundness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, Hebrews and Revelation use various expressions to describe, portray, and unveil this wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I ask you to take full note of the particulars revealed in these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It may seem that this message on the heirs of salvation has nothing to do with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Believe me, if you are going to know Christ, you must know this message, for it contains a particular aspect concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is wonderful, profound, unlimited, rich, and marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As such a One, He certainly needs all of us to be heirs of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Salvation is nothing less than the wonderful person of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ Himself, as the most profound, marvelous, unlimited, and immeasurable One, is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To say that we are heirs of salvation means that we inherit this profound, marvelous, immeasurable, and unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ s profoundness requires our partnership.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our partnership with Christ unveils the profoundness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I. THE FIRSTBORN SON BEING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE APPOINTED HEIR</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His economy God not only has a great operation, but He also has tremendous riches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In His operation He has accomplished and is going to accomplish many things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He has also created and brought forth many things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this, He has appointed the Son to be not only the Operator but also the Heir.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He also has given the Son the authority to do everything in His purpose and the right to inherit all things in His operation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hebrews 1:2 says that God made the universe through the Son and that He appointed the Son to be the Heir of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Colossians 1:16 says that all things were created by and for the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>John 13:3 tells us that the Father has given all things to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, the Son is the Lord of all Acts 10:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Firstly, the Son was appointed by God the Father 1:2 ; then He was anointed by the Father with the Spirit 1:9 ; and eventually, after the Son had been designated to be the Son of God Rom 1:4 , being begotten of God in His resurrection to be the Firstborn Son of God 1:5; Acts 13:33 , He was inaugurated as the Lord of all into His office at the time of His ascension into the heavens Acts 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was not only appointed and anointed by God, but, in His exaltation, was inaugurated as both the Lord and Christ to administrate God s operation and was designated as the legal Heir to inherit all things in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He, as Isaac, the Son of Abraham, is going to inherit the earth Psa 2:8 , the kingdom Dan 7:13-14 , the throne Luke 1:32 , and all things Matt 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since He is not only the Son of God, but also the Heir of God, even the legal Heir of God, all that God the Father is and has is for His possession John 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is our Savior, the One who is the salvation of which we are heirs.</S>
