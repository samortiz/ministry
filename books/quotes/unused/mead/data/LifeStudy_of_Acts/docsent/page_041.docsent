   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>ARREST AND INQUIRY BY THE SANHEDRIN</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verses 1 and 2 say, And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, being greatly disturbed because of their teaching the people and announcing in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The captain here is the captain of the temple guard.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Sadducees were a sect within Judaism 5:17 .</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both the Pharisees and the Sadducees were denounced by John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus as a brood of vipers Matt 3:7; 12:34; 23:33 .</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was a gathering of the Jewish Sanhedrin v. 15 . It was this Sanhedrin composed of the Jewish leaders that became the strongest opponent of the Lord Jesus and His ministry in the four Gospels and condemned Him to death Matt 26:59 . Now it was the same Sanhedrin with its constituents that began the persecution of the apostles and their ministry in Acts 5:21; 6:12; 22:30 . This indicates that Judaism had fallen into the hand of God s enemy, Satan, the Devil, and was being used by him to frustrate and attempt to destroy God s move in His New Testament economy for the carrying out of His eternal purpose, which is to bring His kingdom to the earth by the establishing and building up of the churches through the preaching of the gospel of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John and Alexander may have been kindred of the high priest.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 4:7 says, And having stood them in the midst, they inquired, By what power or in what name did you do this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their question refers to the healing of the lame man in chapter three.</S>
