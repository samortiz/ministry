<h2 class="head1">SECOND TIMOTHY</h2>
<p>Second Timothy is an inoculation against the decline of the church. The way to inoculate the churches against their decline is by teaching the truth. By teaching the truth the degraded churches can be brought back. Because we are still under the degradation of the church, there is much need of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fanning the Teaching Spirit into Flame</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 1:5-7 says, &ldquo;Having been reminded of the unfeigned faith in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded dwells also in you. For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gift that the Lord had given to Timothy, according to the context of 1 and 2 Timothy, was probably the teaching gift (1 Tim. 4:14, 11, 13, 16). Teaching is altogether not a miraculous thing. Teaching is a matter of life, and life is a matter of our spirit. Thus, the gift of God Timothy needed to fan into flame was the gift of teaching. He needed to fan the teaching gift into flame. Timothy needed to teach. What is needed to inoculate the church against the decline, the degradation, is not a miraculous gift such as healing, but the sound, sober teaching by exercising one&rsquo;s regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;for&rdquo; at the beginning of verse 7, &ldquo;For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind,&rdquo; indicates that verse 7 is an explanation of verse 6. Thus, the gift of God in verse 6 should also be considered as the spirit given by God. Verse 6 refers to the gift of God, the spiritual ability, and verse 7 tells us what God has given&mdash;a spirit of power, love, and a sober mind. The spirit in this verse is our human spirit, regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit (John 3:6, Rom. 8:16). To fan into flame the gift of God is related to our regenerated spirit. Probably in the entire New Testament, verse 7 is the unique verse that fully develops our human spirit. &ldquo;Of power&rdquo; refers to our will, &ldquo;of love&rdquo; to our emotion, and &ldquo;of a sober mind&rdquo; to our mind. This indicates a strong will, a loving emotion, and a sober mind have very much to do with a strong spirit for the exercise of the gift of God which is in us.</p>
<p>Such a spirit of power and love with a sober mind is for teaching. We have to fan such a teaching spirit into flame. I feel that this point fits in our present situation. We all should fan our teaching spirit into flame. Fan the teaching spirit of power, of love, and of a sober mind. If you do not have a sober mind you will teach nonsensically. You need a very sober mind to apprehend all the truth. Then you can teach with power and with love.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding a Pattern of Healthy Words</h2>
<p>The next crucial point is in 1:13. A pattern of healthy words is an example. The word in verse 12 is a pattern, an example, of healthy words. To hold a pattern of healthy words means to live by the healthy words. Paul&rsquo;s intention in this section was to encourage and strengthen Timothy to not live in cooperation with the degradation but to live in another way. To live another way, in spite of the degradation of the church, is to be nourished with the healthy words. Then you yourself, your living, and your daily life will be a pattern of the healthy words.</p>
 <p>Now we have to apply this to our own experience. We should not just pass on these crucial points to others. Rather we should live these crucial points in spite of the environment of this age, in spite of the trend of today&rsquo;s Christianity, and even in spite of the world situation. Today&rsquo;s world situation is altogether concerning how to become rich, yet we should live in another way. This other way is to all the time be nourished with the healthy words. Then we will hold the healthy words in our living as a pattern. Paul was such a person. Paul lived such a pattern in front of Timothy. Therefore, Paul charged him to keep this pattern. All the saints should hold a pattern of the healthy words.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Empowered in the Grace</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 2:1 and 2 say, &ldquo;You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus, and the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; Today we need to be empowered in grace, which is the processed Triune God given to us or dispensed into us for our enjoyment, to commit the healthy words we have experienced to faithful men who will be competent to teach the same healthy words to others also. We are to be empowered in this grace not to do miracles, but to commit the healthy words we have enjoyed to faithful men to produce many competent teachers, whose speaking will inoculate the church against the decline.</p>
<p>Being empowered in the grace will issue in you being a teacher (2:2), a soldier (v. 3), a contender (v. 5), a farmer (v. 6), a carpenter (v. 15) to cut the word of God with no bias, and a vessel unto honor (v. 21).</p>
