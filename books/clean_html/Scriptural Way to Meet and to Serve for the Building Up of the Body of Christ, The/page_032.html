<h2 class="head1">TO HAVE THE TRIUNE GOD EMBODIED IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is first to have the Triune God embodied in Christ (Col. 2:9). God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, the divine Three, are embodied in Christ. Christ is not only divine but also human. Because He is human, He has a human body. His being the embodiment of the Triune God indicates that He had a solid, physical, touchable body. Before God became incarnate, He was invisible, untouchable, and even unapproachable. But this God was embodied in Christ. He was made solid, physical, touchable, and visible. John 1:18 tells us that no one has ever seen God, but the only begotten Son has declared Him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Colossians 2:9 says that Christ is the embodiment, not only of the Godhead but also of the fullness of the entire Godhead. <em>Fullness</em> in the usage of the New Testament means the expression of the riches. Christ was not only the embodiment of the riches of the Godhead but also the fullness of the Godhead, implying all the riches of the Godhead expressed in Christ. The Godhead was made visible, touchable, and physical by God putting Himself into a human body. Whatever the Triune God is was put into a human body. The Triune God put Himself into a human Person who had a physical body, and this Person was Jesus Christ. This Man, Jesus Christ, had a body exactly the same as our body. Since Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way, and in His glorified body (Phil. 3:21) now and forever it dwells. Thus, the Triune God embodied Himself in Christ, and this embodiment was the first step for the completion of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">For the Incarnation of Christ</h2>
<p>In eternity past, Christ was anointed and appointed by God to be the Christ, the commissioned One, the anointed One, the appointed One (Heb. 1:9; Dan. 9:26; 1 Pet. 1:20). Although He was appointed, He still needed to be completed. Although Christ was eternally perfect, He was not complete because he was still short of the human nature. By what way was Christ completed? Firstly, by incarnation. The first item in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy was to have the Triune God embodied in Christ for the incarnation of Christ (John 1:1, 14). For Christ to be God&rsquo;s commissioned One to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, He needed to become a man. The divine Person alone, God Himself alone, could not accomplish or carry out His eternal plan.</p>
<p>In His eternal plan, His eternal economy, one item was needed: human blood was needed to redeem fallen humanity. To redeem the fallen human race, there was the need of human blood. Neither the angels nor God in his divinity alone has blood. Blood is in the human life. In the Old Testament, before the incarnation of Christ, the blood of the animal sacrifices was used and that blood was a type of the blood of Christ. The blood of these sacrifices could not wash away man&rsquo;s sins, but this Man, Jesus Christ, died on the cross and shed His blood for us. His blood is surely human blood. Yet in Acts 20:28 this blood is called the blood of God. How could God have blood? God could have blood because He became a man.</p>
<p>This Man&rsquo;s blood is reckoned as God&rsquo;s blood, and it is also referred to in 1 John 1:7 as the blood of God&rsquo;s Son. Although the Son of God is divine, He has blood. The blood of Jesus, the Son of God, cleanses us from all sin, but the divine Son of God without humanity could not possess blood. Thus, the One who accomplished God&rsquo;s commission needed to have the human nature so He could shed His blood for fallen man. Before His incarnation, Christ did not have humanity, so Christ had been anointed but not completed. The incarnation of Christ is the first step in the completion of Christ. His incarnation brought the Triune God into a human body to produce a God-man.</p>
