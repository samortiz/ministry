   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Eight Drawing Water with Rejoicing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>from the Springs of Salvation Scripture Reading: Isa 12:1-6;</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jer 2:13; Exo 17:6; Num 20:8; John 4:10, 14b God s intention in His economy is to be the fountain, the source, of living waters to dispense Himself into His chosen people for their satisfaction and enjoyment Jer 2:13; Psa 36:8-9; Isa 12:1-6: The goal of this enjoyment is to produce the church, God s counterpart, as God s increase, God s enlargement, to be God s fullness for His expression John 3:29-30; Eph 3:16-19, 21 ; this is the heart s desire, the good pleasure, of God in His economy 1:5, 9; 3:9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 4:14b reveals a flowing Triune God the Father is the fountain, the Son is the spring, and the Spirit is the flowing river, issuing in the totality of the eternal life, the New Jerusalem as the goal of God s eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to realize that whenever God s people are short of the Spirit of life as the water of life, they will have problems; when God s people have an abundance of the saving Spirit as the living water, their problems among themselves and with God are solved Exo 17:1-7; Num 20:2-13: Through incarnation Christ came to earth as the rock; on the cross He was smitten by the authority of God s righteous law to accomplish God s redemption, and out of His pierced side flowed blood and water Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4; John 19:34: The blood for our judicial redemption saves us from the guilt of sin, and the water of life in resurrection for our organic salvation saves us from the power of sin Gen 2:21-22; Zech 13:1; Psa 36:8-9; Rev 21:6; Hymns, #1058, stanza 1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His side was pierced, and living water flowed out for God s people to drink; this living water is the water of life in resurrection the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the ultimate issue of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since Christ has been crucified and the Spirit has been given, there is no need for Christ to be crucified again, that is, no need to strike the rock again, that the living water may flow; to receive the living water from the crucified Christ, we need only to take the rod and speak to the rock Num 20:8: To take the rod is to identify with Christ in His death and apply the death of Christ to ourselves and our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To speak to the rock is to speak a direct word to Christ as the smitten rock, asking Him to give us the Spirit of life cf.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 4:10; Luke 11:13 based on the fact that the Spirit has already been given.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we apply the death of Christ to ourselves and ask Christ in faith to give us the Spirit, we will receive the living Spirit as the bountiful supply of life Phil 1:19.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In being angry with the people and in wrongly striking the rock twice, Moses failed to sanctify God; in being angry when God was not angry, Moses did not represent God rightly in His holy nature, and in striking the rock twice, he did not keep God s word in His economy Num 20:7-11.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In all that we say and do concerning God s people, our attitude must be according to God s holy nature, and our actions must be according to His divine economy; this is to sanctify Him; otherwise, in our words and deeds we will rebel against Him and offend Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>12, 24; 27:14.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The term the springs of salvation implies that salvation is the source: The source of the springs of salvation is a fountain, and that fountain is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The springs, which are Christ, issue out of the fountain and become the rivers, which are the Spirit John 4:14b; 7:37-39.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The processed Triune God is the fountain, the springs, and the river of water of life; God as our salvation is the fountain, Christ is the springs of salvation for our experience and enjoyment, and the Spirit is the flow of this salvation within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To receive the Lord as our salvation is to draw water from the springs of salvation; when this water enters into us, it permeates our entire being, it passes through our being, it is assimilated by us, and it even becomes us Isa 12:3; John 4:10, 14b.</S>
