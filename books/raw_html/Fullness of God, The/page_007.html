	 <h2 class="head1">THE CREATION OF MAN<br />
BEING FOR THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>Man was created in the image of God to express all that God is (Gen. 1:26). All that God is refers to the fullness of God. Hence, man was created for the fullness of God. After we receive God, we continue to take Him into us by breathing Him in until we are filled with all that God is, all His riches, and these riches eventually overflow. This overflow is the fullness, the expression of God.</p>
<p>Even though some of you are new believers, this message is for you and is focused on your need. If we all receive this word, we will realize that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we did not receive a philosophy or religion, neither did we learn a different kind of ritual for worship. These are all in vain and are a waste. Instead, we believed into a true and living God who is the living Spirit. We call Him God, Jehovah, Jesus Christ, the Lord, and the Holy Spirit. This One, who entered into us through our believing and receiving, is rich, and His riches are His attributes. His attributes include life, light, holiness, righteousness, grace, meekness, loving kindness, sincerity, and glory. The more we call on His name, the more He enters into us. The more we gain Him, the more He fills us until He overflows from within us. The issue of this overflow is God&rsquo;s fullness, His expression.</p>
<p>After some of the young brothers and sisters have been saved for a period of time, their parents notice that they are &ldquo;different.&rdquo; After six months their parents say, &ldquo;Our child is not the same. It seems as though he is both weighty and virtuous.&rdquo; Although the parents do not know what happened, they see an expression in their children.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING GOD&rsquo;S RICHES BY CALLING,<br />
AND THE RICHES OVERFLOWING<br />
UNTO THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>What is the expression of God? God&rsquo;s expression is His fullness. The fullness is derived from God&rsquo;s riches, and God&rsquo;s riches are within Him. God is now in us; hence, our need is to daily call on Him. Even though students in Taiwan have much schoolwork, a busy schedule, and are exhausted from their studying, they should not forget to call on the Lord. The most important thing in our day is to call on His name every morning. Whether it is a holiday or a school day and whether or not we are busy, we should rise early every day to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. Perhaps we do not know how to pray long prayers, but short prayers are sufficient. Furthermore, even while we are in class, we can call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is an immense difference between calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name and not calling on His name. When we lack wisdom, we receive wisdom by calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, we are able to remember things when we call on His name, and our anger dissipates when we call on His name. We must believe this. If we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, our days will not pass by in vain or be wasted. Moreover, we will not speak nonsense, because the Lord within us will keep us calm. We all have the Lord within us; hence, we need to learn to call on His name every moment of every day. Then His riches will become our enjoyment. The Lord is rich to all who call upon Him (Rom. 10:12). When we enjoy His riches and are filled with His riches, they will overflow from within us to become God&rsquo;s fullness. God will thus be expressed through us.</p>
