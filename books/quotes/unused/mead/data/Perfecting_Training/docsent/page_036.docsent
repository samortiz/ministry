   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN A HABIT TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to change the subject of the Perfecting Training from the matter of peculiarity to the matter of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see that we must build up a habit to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For some time now I have been bothered that it is so hard to have a habit to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of you love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Your being here is a sign that you love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because you love Him you have been stirred up to seek how to live Him and to practice the one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to my experience the hardest thing is to get into the habit to live Christ and to practice the one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Years ago I learned the fact that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 , but I never realized that this should be an experience to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It should not be just a doctrine remaining there in the Bible and in our apprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It should be an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when I began to practice this matter I discovered it is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is it hard?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because seemingly there is nothing sinful and there is nothing wrong if you don t practice the one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You can still be a good person; you can still be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No one would condemn you, and even you would not condemn yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are all unconscious of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is something beyond our thinking and beyond our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the morning you may have prayed concerning practicing one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After that you went to breakfast, and right away that matter was in the air, not in your living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not until the night came did you realize you didn t practice the one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then you confessed your failure and the next morning you prayed again concerning living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It s really hard to build up such a habit of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To build up a habit of living Christ in our experience is not only in the air, but just like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is altogether not solid.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You don t need to intentionally forget it; you just forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is easy to pick up the doctrine of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We started to use this term about two years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before that time we used the terms live by Christ and live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We never used such a direct expression to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since that time we learned this term, and we put it into our doctrinal memory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet it is very little in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although you may have appreciated this term very much, yet you have never put it into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is hard because it is an all-day-long matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is like breathing and living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both breathing and living are continual.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To live Christ is just living, and to practice the one spirit with the Lord is just breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These two matters should be lifelong and all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet our experience is altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Occasionally we live Christ in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we die for twelve hours, or at least we sleep for twelve hours.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later we wake up for awhile and live Christ for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From my experience I ve fully realized this is the hardest thing to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever I have a little time I contact the Lord: Lord, I surely would like to learn the secret that I may continually live You, that I could live You without interruption and without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nearly every day I have had this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>WATCH AND PRAY</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today as I went to the Lord concerning this matter of the secret of living Him, I had the inner feeling that it has something to do with the matter of watching, of watchfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So let us read a very familiar verse, Matthew 26:41: Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is ready, but the flesh is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this verse the word weak means sleepy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The word watch has at least two meanings: the first meaning is to look at, to observe, or to see; the second meaning is not to sleep, to stay awake.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>M. R. Vincent, in his Word Studies in the New Testament, says that the word watch is related to habit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He says that it is derived from a word composed of two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first part means to hunt or to seek.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The second part means sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, it means to hunt sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It means you are addicted to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You are a sleeper.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because Peter was sleeping and pursuing his sleep, the Lord Jesus said, Watch!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Lord Jesus went to pray, Peter and the others went to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the Lord Jesus told them to watch, He meant don t sleep!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Wake up!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to the context, it means their spirit was willing, but their flesh was sleepy and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>So Vincent says that this matter of being watchful must be a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord Jesus joined these two words, watch and pray, together.</S>
