   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Danger in Disciplining Young Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All parents know that every child is naughty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some babies throw their rice bowl when their mother is feeding them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What should the mother do?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The mother mostly cherishes them to make them happy, and by cherishing them, she feeds them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Parents raise their children by cherishing them in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have eight children; I have suffered much, and I have learned all the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians 6:4 says, Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we discipline our children with provoking, our discipline is of no value.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we are going to discipline a child, we must go to the Lord and say, Lord, take away my provocation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is very hard.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some parents whom I have taught in this way have said that without being provoked they cannot discipline their child.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To them, punishing a child requires that they be provoked.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Parents must remember not to spank their child when they are provoked.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If one is offended by his child, he becomes a provocation to him, and he loses his capacity to discipline the child.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When one is angry, he should not touch his children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He should leave them, kneel down, and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, when he is cherished by the Lord, he can go back to his children to cherish them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a parent provokes his child and spanks him, the child may leave home and run away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the parent needs to spend time to find him and bring him back.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many children after being provoked to anger and spanked leave home and do not want to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, the parent has to submit to them, bowing down his head to beg them to come back home, and he may have to gain them back indirectly through a big brother, a cousin, or some other relative.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Luke 15 first tells us how the Lord as the Shepherd sought for the one lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second, the woman, signifying the Holy Spirit, lit a lamp and searched the house to find the lost coin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Third, a father lost his son, the prodigal, who eventually returned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The son prepared an apology for his father, but the father was already waiting to receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The son did not first see the father; the father first saw him and ran to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Brethren teacher from England under whom I first learned this chapter taught us that in the entire Bible only Luke 15 says that God ran.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God only ran once, and it was to receive a returning prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Brother Nee s preaching concerning the loving father who watched for his son s return, he once told a story of a naughty boy who ran away after being punished by his father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The father sat in his living room every night for many days expecting to receive his son back.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One night the naughty boy came back home and was surprised to see his father still sitting there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The father said, Son, since you left I have been sitting here every night waiting and expecting to receive you back.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a father s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our brothers and sisters homes should be like this, full of love and full of expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Gaining People through a Proper Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day Hall Three in the church in Taipei had a time with all the parents of the ones who lived in the brothers and sisters homes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The brothers showed all the parents their children s living room, dining room, dormitory, and beds.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many parents were inspired by this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They went out to tell other parents to send their children to certain schools close to those homes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some of the unsaved parents were even saved because of that demonstration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should have this kind of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we have this kind of spirit, the number of houses that we now have will not be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more houses we have, the better it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is one of the ways for us to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The brothers in Taipei have the assurance that they can gain people in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When school opens, the brothers and sisters also go to the campus to set up a table and get the names of the freshmen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the brothers and sisters work on those persons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In a similar way, the Mormons in the United States teach their young people to speak good Mandarin and send them to the airport in proper attire.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They stand at the entry and watch the new young people come in. They greet them in Mandarin and ask if they are students coming to attend school.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then they take their address and offer them a ride.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the way they gain people.</S>
