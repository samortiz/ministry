<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br>BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</H2><P>The divine dispensing is carried out by the Spirit of life as the life-giving Spirit with His bountiful supply (Rom. 8:2; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Phil. 1:19b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE WAY TO RECEIVE THE DIVINE DISPENSING</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. To Drink the Spirit</H2><P>The way to receive the divine dispensing is first to drink the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13b; John 7:37-39) in our spirit by exercising our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Live and Walk by the Spirit</H2><P>The way to receive the divine dispensing is also to live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25). This requires that we exercise our spirit.</P><P>God has done everything necessary to consummate Himself into the one Spirit. This Spirit today is the totality of the processed and consummated Triune God. When we were attracted by Christ, believed in Him, and called on the name of the Lord Jesus, a living person entered into us. This One is the Spirit as the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. When He as the Spirit dwells in us, that indwelling One is Christ, and Christ is the Triune God. This One is all-inclusive, and today as the consummated Spirit He indwells our spirit.</P><P>When we were saved, the Spirit came into our spirit to regenerate our spirit, to enliven our spirit, and to be mingled with our spirit. The Christian life is a story of this mingled Spirit. To live a normal Christian life is to care for the two spirits&#151;the divine Spirit in our regenerated human spirit.</P><P>When we contact the Lord, when we pray to Him, and when we praise Him, our part is to receive His dispensing, and His part is to dispense. The more we receive, the more He dispenses. In this way we gain all the elements of the Triune God in His person, in His nature, and in His life. As a result, the Triune God grows in us. When He grows in us, we grow in Him. This is all a story of life-dispensing.</P><P>Through the abundant receiving of the divine dispensing, we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and we grow in the divine life. This is the Christian life, and this Christian life is altogether due to the divine dispensing of the divine economy.</P>
