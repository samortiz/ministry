   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S MEASURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After He answered Peter, the Lord went on with a parable in verses 23 through 27: "For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the loan."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The kingdom of the heavens refers to God's rule on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is like an earthly king ruling over a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ten thousand talents equal approximately three hundred thousand taels of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This signifies that the slave owed his master an incalculably great debt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He did not have the means to repay because he did not have anything with which to repay his master.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His house was empty, and he was destitute.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the Lord shows us that a sinner's debt far exceeds what he can repay.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who cannot forgive others do not realize the forgiveness that they have received.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The debt that we owe God can never be repaid.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The debt we owe God is too great in comparison to the debt that others owe us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God's children have a right evaluation of their debt to God, they will be generous in their forgiving of their brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who do not realize the depth of the grace they have received are prone to be short in grace themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to see the immensity of the debt we owe God before we can see the trivialness of the debt others owe us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this parable, the master, finding that the debtor did not have anything, ordered all that he had to be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, even if the debtor had sold all that he had, he still would not have been able to repay his debt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A sinner is judged in this world as well as in the eternal age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what it means to have all of one's possessions sold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 26 the slave pleaded with the master on his knees, saying, "Be patient with me and I will repay you all."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is hard for man to know what grace is and what the gospel is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man thinks that he may not be able to make it today, but that he will make it some day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He may not be able to fulfill the requirements today, but he will fulfill them some day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He thinks that his motive is good and that he does not have any intention of procrastinating on his repayment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet he does not know anything about grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He pleads with the Lord, not for mercy but for time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He pleads for the Lord's patience but has no thought of His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we see two things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first is the virtue of the slave, and the second is his shortcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His virtue was to ask for patience from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was looking for grace through righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But God begins to dispense grace only when man stops speaking to Him in terms of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is always right for man to come to God and seek for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even before a man comes under the shining of the gospel and sees his true condition, God is pleased to hear him plead for grace, and He is willing to grant grace gladly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Anyone who feels that he is indebted to God and who seeks grace will find favor in His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the virtue of the slave.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His shortcoming is that he did not know enough of his sin and indebtedness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He said that he would repay, but the very thought of a repayment is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He forgot that he owed ten thousand talents.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He did not see the seriousness of his own sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the reason he was not able to forgive those who owed him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He did not realize his pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, he spoke of repayment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He would not be able to repay within his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In fact, he would not be able to repay in ten lifetimes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When a man is saved, his feeling for sin is not too acute.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is not clear why he is sinful, and he does not know the depths of his depravity.</S>
