<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee on the Gospel of John to the church in Taipei during midweek meetings from October 1959 to January 1960. The messages were originally published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> in 1962 and 1963.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD BEING IN THE BEGINNING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1-4</h1>
<p>The Lord has shown us the matter of life again and again over the years. In recent years the Lord has been showing us that He will build His church with His life. The Lord is leading us to know life and building. In these chapters we will look at the matter of life and building in the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE ISSUING IN BUILDING</h2>
<p>The matter of life is presented to man from the beginning to the end of the Bible. In Genesis 2:8-9 God placed man in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden so that man would obtain, enjoy, and experience life. In Revelation 22:1-2 the tree of life is at the center of the New Jerusalem. From the beginning to the end of the Bible, God&rsquo;s focus is on life.</p>
<p>Following God&rsquo;s speaking concerning the tree of life in Genesis 2:9, verse 12 speaks of building materials, including gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. Chapter 2 speaks of life and of building materials. If we had only this chapter, we would not understand the relationship between the tree of life and the building materials of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. However, in the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life&rdquo; (10:10), and He also spoke of building the church, saying, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (2:19). At the end of the Bible, Revelation shows a holy city that has been built with gold, pearls, and precious stones and that has the tree of life at its center. This is a clear picture showing that God&rsquo;s central work in the universe involves His coming to be life to His redeemed in order to build them into His eternal dwelling place. The issue of life is a city, a universal building. This universal city is built with life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF JOHN BEING<br />
ON LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>There were many ministers of the word in the Bible. In the Old Testament Moses and David were important ministers of the word. In the New Testament the apostles who wrote the Epistles also were important ministers of the word. Of these ministers of the word, the apostle John had a specific burden related to life and building. The Gospel of John begins by speaking of the Lord Jesus as the Word who became flesh so that we might have life (1:14; 3:15-16, 36). The Epistles of John speak of the fellowship of life enabling the believers, who have received the Lord as life, to enter deeper into God (1 John 1:2-10). Finally, Revelation shows how believers are built in God&rsquo;s life to be His eternal tabernacle, the dwelling place of God with man (21:3), which is a city built with gold, pearls, and precious stones. John&rsquo;s ministry speaks of life and building.</p>
<p>Other apostles also spoke of life and building. Peter, for example, said that God the Father &ldquo;has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&rdquo; so that we might become partakers of His life and nature (1 Pet. 1:3; 2 Pet. 1:4). We have God&rsquo;s life and nature, and we are living stones being built up into a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). The apostle Paul also spoke of life and building. He spoke of Christ being our life and of our being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit (Col. 3:4; Eph. 2:22). Although Peter and Paul both spoke on life and building, their ministries do not focus solely on life and building. John&rsquo;s ministry, however, is focused fully on life and building. John thoroughly presented the Lord Jesus as life to us, and he revealed the building of the New Jerusalem in detail.</p>
<p>John said that the Lord Jesus came so that men might have life (John 3:15-16; 10:10). He also referred to the Lord Jesus raising up the temple of God (2:19). Words such as <em>life</em> and <em>tabernacled</em> are mentioned in chapter 1. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; In the New Jerusalem there is a river of water of life and the tree of life (Rev. 22:1-2); furthermore, the city is the tabernacle of God (21:3). The Greek word for <em>tabernacle</em> in Revelation 21:3 contains the same root as the word <em>tabernacled</em> in John 1:14. Thus, John&rsquo;s ministry specifically shows how life is for building and how building comes from life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE AND BUILDING BEING<br />
THE CENTRAL MESSAGE OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Although life and building are specific to the ministry of John, they also are the central message of the Bible. From beginning to end the Bible is a story of life and building. At the beginning of the Bible we see the tree of life, which is available for man to receive, and the river of water of life, which contains materials for building&mdash;gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (Gen. 2:9-12). The matter of building is present throughout the Old Testament. In Exodus God gained a group of people on the earth and erected His tabernacle (ch. 40). In 2 Samuel David established God&rsquo;s kingdom for God to reign (chs. 6&mdash;7). In 1 Kings, Solomon built the holy temple and the holy city. When the building of the temple was finished, God&rsquo;s glory was manifested in the temple (8:11). Furthermore, God&rsquo;s authority was in place, and God&rsquo;s will was carried out. Even the work of the enemy was focused on damaging the building, destroying the walls around Jerusalem, burning the temple, and carrying God&rsquo;s people into exile at Babylon (2 Kings 25:8-21). After seventy years of captivity, some of the children of Israel returned from Babylon to Jerusalem to rebuild the holy temple and the holy city (Jer. 25:11; Ezra 1:1-6; 6:13-15; Neh. 6:15-16). When Nehemiah was rebuilding the holy city, the enemies around the city rallied their strength to destroy the building (2:19; 4:1-8; 6:1-9). This shows that God&rsquo;s building is the center of His work in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, men thought that God wanted to build a physical temple. However, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (John 2:19). The Lord Jesus was speaking of the temple of His body (v. 21), meaning that the Lord would build up God&rsquo;s dwelling place, God&rsquo;s temple, in resurrection. The temple of God that He spoke of is a spiritual temple; it is the Lord Himself and all those who have received God&rsquo;s life and who have been made alive in His resurrection. As such ones, we are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit (Eph. 2:22). This is the central point that God reveals in the Bible, and it is the central work that God is doing in the universe. God wants to enter into us to be our life and to build us up as His eternal dwelling place.</p><h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL POINTS CONCERNING<br />
LIFE AND BUILDING IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>John&rsquo;s ministry is focused on life and building. We have seen the matter of life and building over the years, but the more I read the writings of John in his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation, the more light, anointing, and confirmation I have, and the more I feel that God wants to release messages on life and building among His children in this age. I once did a concise study of the Gospel of John with the brothers and sisters in Manila, but now I am quite burdened to give messages specifically related to life and building on crucial topics in the first few chapters of the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John is an exceedingly rich book; it would take at least three hundred messages to cover all its topics. Chapter 1, for example, contains many crucial terms and phrases, such as <em>in the beginning was the Word; in Him was life; the life was the light of men; as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God; who were begotten...of God; the Word became flesh and tabernacled; full of grace and reality; for of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace; the law was given through Moses;</em> and <em>grace and reality came through Jesus Christ</em> (vv. 1, 4, 12-14, 16-17). There are many crucial topics within just the first eighteen verses of chapter 1.</p>
<p>The most difficult phrase in this chapter is <em>in the beginning was the Word,</em> which refers to a beginning before there was a beginning in time. This topic cannot be exhausted in just one message, but I can speak only according to what I know and understand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING</h2>
<p>The beginning spoken of in verse 1 precedes the beginning spoken of in Genesis 1:1, which says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; The beginning in Genesis is the beginning of time, but the beginning in John 1:1 refers to a beginning before the beginning of time. The beginning in Genesis 1:1 is the beginning of time, but the beginning in John 1:1 refers to eternity, which has no beginning in time. The Gospel of John shows that the matter of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming to be our life was not from the time of John&rsquo;s writing or from the beginning of God&rsquo;s creation of all things but from the beginning of eternity, which has no beginning. This indicates that the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming to be our life should be viewed from the standpoint of eternity. The clothes that we wear or the house that we build are matters related to time; they are not eternal. In contrast, the Lord&rsquo;s entering into us is a matter related to eternity, even though it occurs in time. The beginning of this matter was in eternity, and it was decided in eternity. From our perspective and experience, the Lord&rsquo;s coming as life occurred in time, but from the Lord&rsquo;s perspective, it is eternal in nature.</p>
<p>Whenever we talk about spiritual matters related to God&rsquo;s life, we must realize that there is no limitation related to time. The Gospel of John is not limited to time. The only time that matters in the Gospel of John is eternity. Furthermore, the Gospel of John shows that the life we have received is an eternal life. In the Gospel of John there is no limitation of time; everything is eternal.</p>
<p>In the same principle, there is no issue of space in the Gospel of John. If we want to speak of space, we must speak in terms of God Himself. In the Gospel of John the only time that matters is eternity, and the only space that matters is God Himself. The space that we are in is God Himself. This is the reason that there are so many references to being in God in the Gospel of John (10:38; 14:10, 17; 15:4-5). The Lord even said, &ldquo;I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (14:20). God is our space. We need to remember that God&rsquo;s coming to be our life is a matter that was in the beginning, in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD</h2>
<p>How can God be man&rsquo;s life? This is a crucial matter. God is too wonderful and too mysterious. As the Spirit, He is too abstract for us to fathom or even describe. Nevertheless, John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word.&rdquo; In a very simple yet profound way, this shows that God comes to us as the Word. This Word is not an ordinary or light Word but a great and serious Word.</p>
<p>The Word as it relates to the universe may be hard to understand, but humanly speaking we know that a word is a declaration, manifestation, and expression. With every utterance of a word, what goes forth is a declaration, a manifestation, and an expression. When we come to a meeting and listen to a message, some may laugh and others may cry in response to the words, and even when we dismiss the meeting with words, there is the response of standing up and leaving. Words move many things.</p>
<p>The universe originated from God&rsquo;s speaking. Psalm 33:9 says, &ldquo;He spoke, and it was.&rdquo; God created all things through speaking; as soon as He spoke, it was. Therefore, Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God.&rdquo; When God created all things, He did not use any material or method; He just spoke. His speaking was His method, and His word was His material. Even today God is &ldquo;upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power&rdquo; (1:3). The Word in the Gospel of John is the Lord Jesus, who came to be our life (1:1, 4, 14).</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING WITH GOD, AND<br />
THE WORD BEING GOD</h2>
<p>John 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.&rdquo; In these verses John speaks of the Word and God. If he had only said, &ldquo;The Word was with God,&rdquo; we might think that the Word and God are two separate entities, because <em>with</em> implies that there are two things. However, John also says, &ldquo;The Word was God,&rdquo; indicating that the two are one. God&rsquo;s speaking cannot be separated from God Himself. However, when a man speaks, his word is one thing, and he himself is another thing; the two are not one. For example, we can read a letter written by a person in our family, but we cannot touch the person when we read his letter. His words and his person are separate. The Lord Jesus, as the Word of God, cannot be separated from God; He and God are eternally one. This is the reason that John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; As the Word, the Lord is not only with God; He is God Himself. God cannot be found apart from this Word. The Word is not only with God; the Word is God Himself. This is a mysterious, incomprehensible matter. John used simple words, but they referred to things full of mystery.</p>
<p>If God did not want to be manifested, understood, or known by man, He would be an unfathomable God. But since He desires to be manifested, understood, and known, He moves as the Word. The Word is His going forth. Rather than hiding through inaction, He goes forth through His utterance as the Word. His word is not separate from Him. As soon as a man speaks, his word is separated from him, but since God is the Word, His word is Himself. He is God even when He does not move, but when He moves, He is the Word. God&rsquo;s word is not separate from Him when He speaks, because God is the Word.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s coming to be our life is God&rsquo;s coming forth in His move and in His expression. Without being the Word, God would have no way to be our life. God is inseparable from the Word because He is the Word. God goes wherever His word goes.</p>
<p>God being the Word is an eternal matter; in the beginning He was the Word. This means that God in eternity was not stationary, unexpressive, or silent. God has been speaking and manifesting Himself throughout all eternity: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.&rdquo; This means that God has always been going forth, moving, and speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THINGS COMING INTO BEING THROUGH HIM</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s activity and utterance brought in the creation of all things: &ldquo;All things came into being through Him&rdquo; (v. 3). Once He moved, all things came forth; once He spoke, all things were created. He spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood (Psa. 33:9). This is an incredible matter. As soon as God moved in the universe, all things were created. The creation of all things can be considered as God&rsquo;s going forth, God&rsquo;s being expressed.</p>
<p>Hence, Psalm 19:1 says, &ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God, / And the expanse proclaims the work of His hands.&rdquo; When God came forth, God was expressed, and His move brought forth all things. The myriads of things in the universe speak of God&rsquo;s move, which is like an expanding ripple on the surface of water. When a stone is cast into a pool of water, there is an expanding ripple on the surface. This ripple expands from the center to the circumference. Radio waves and electrical current also spread out like ripples on the water. These examples illustrate the effect of God&rsquo;s speaking; His speaking produces &ldquo;ripples&rdquo; that bring forth everything. All things are the issue of God&rsquo;s going forth.</p>
<p>It is difficult for a person to look at a mountain range, sail across the ocean, or gaze at the night sky without having some sense of God&rsquo;s existence. Those who are saved feel God&rsquo;s presence, but even atheists feel something of God&rsquo;s presence. A sense of God&rsquo;s presence may not be as strong in the midst of a bustling city, in a movie theater, or in a dance club because of their stupefying effects. But when we are in some remote mountains or on the vast ocean, a feeling that there is a sovereign Lord, a Creator in the universe, spontaneously rises up in us. This is because God&rsquo;s going forth is manifested in the things made by God (Rom. 1:20). This does not mean that all things are God but rather that all things that were made by God&rsquo;s speaking manifest and express Him. When God moved in eternity to express Himself through His speaking, all things issued forth. This is a mysterious matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>John says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (John 1:4). God&rsquo;s speaking not only resulted in the creation of all things, but His speaking enables man to have God&rsquo;s life. God spoke in Genesis 1, and all things were created. God&rsquo;s speaking in the Gospel of John brings His life into created man. Verse 25 of chapter 5 says, &ldquo;The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s speaking enables created man to receive His life. A person who hears God&rsquo;s inward speaking is a person in whom God is moving and living. The extent to which God can work and live in us depends on the extent to which we let Him speak in us. The more He speaks in us, the more He works and lives in us. If we want to be filled with Him, we must be filled with His word.</p>
<p>Not letting God speak in us is like shutting Him outside a door. When we give Him a little opportunity to speak, He will do a little work of &ldquo;creation&rdquo; in us. When we let Him speak more in us, He will impart more life into us. The more we let Him speak, the more He will work in us, and the richer His life element will be in us. God reaches us as the Word.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD BEING WITH GOD<br />
AND BEING GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1-3, 18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WORD AND GOD</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; This indicates that whenever God expresses Himself or moves, He does so as the Word. Whenever He comes forth and speaks to man, He does so as the Word. Since the Word is God, why does John speak of the Word as being with God? In order to answer this question, we need to know that there was a very serious theological dispute during the time that John wrote this Gospel. After the ascension of the Lord Jesus, the apostles went out to preach the gospel and to establish churches. However, soon there were disputes among Christians concerning the person of the Lord Jesus. For example, some said that the Lord Jesus was not God and therefore possessed no divinity. Others said that the Lord Jesus was not God from eternity but obtained divinity and His status as God only in time.</p>
<p>In response to these serious heresies, John, the last of the twelve apostles to depart, wrote his Gospel to prove that the Lord Jesus was God from eternity. Just as God is eternal, the Lord Jesus is eternal because the Lord Jesus is God. In addition to his Gospel, John wrote his Epistles in which he spoke of &ldquo;antichrist&rdquo; and &ldquo;antichrists&rdquo; (1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7). Antichrists are people who deny that the Lord Jesus is God. They go beyond and do not abide in the teaching of Christ (1 John 2:22; 4:3; 2 John 9). Furthermore, John says, &ldquo;Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also&rdquo; (1 John 2:23). This means that we must have the Son in order to have the Father; if we believe only in God but not in the Lord Jesus, who is the Son, as God, we do not have the Father. If we believe only in God and not in the Lord Jesus as God, we have no relationship with God, and God does not have anything to do with us. If we want the objective God to become our subjective God, that is, to be obtained by us and joined to us, we must confess that Jesus is God. Only when we have Jesus Christ do we have God. Only when we have the Son do we have the Father.</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Since Jesus Christ is God, what is the distinction between Jesus Christ and God?&rdquo; The apostle John opened his Gospel with a very wonderful utterance. It was an utterance that had never occurred before in human thought. He does not say, &ldquo;In the beginning was Christ,&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the beginning was Jesus.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word&rdquo; (1:1). He does not refer to the name of the Lord Jesus or to the title of Christ; rather, he refers to the Lord Jesus as the Word. John refers to the Lord Jesus as the Word who was with God and who was God in order to show that the Lord Jesus is not only the mysterious, hidden God but also the revealed God. He is the God who is distinct in His revelation. The distinction between God and the Word is not a distinction based on one being God and the other being the Word. The Lord Jesus is not only God but also the Word. In other words, the Lord Jesus is more than just God; He is the revealed God. Verse 18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; Without being the Word, God could never be seen; however, as the Word, the Lord Jesus is the declared God, the seen God.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit inspired the apostle John to write these words, He was implying that the Lord is not only God but also God in His distinct revelation. He is not only God in eternity but also the uttered and declared God, who can be revealed. Without being the Word, there would be no possibility for man to see Him or know Him. Without being the Word, He could not declare Himself; He would be silent, hidden, and incomprehensibly mysterious. However, as both God and the Word, He is the uttered, declared, and expressed God.</p>
<p>When we consider human words, it is easy to understand that words are separate from a speaker. As soon as a person speaks, the words that are spoken are separate from him. This is also true in regard to writing a letter. As soon as a person writes words on a piece of paper, the words are separate from the writer. Even though human words are an utterance, a declaration, they are no longer a part of us after they are uttered. Hence, when the apostle John said, &ldquo;The Word was with God,&rdquo; he was making a very important point: The Word is not separate from God; the Word is with God. Wherever the Word goes, God goes, and wherever the Word is, God is.</p>
<p>If John only wrote, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; it would be possible to think that the Lord Jesus, as the Word, is separate from God. This would be a serious theological error. However, even as the Word, He is with God; He is not separate from God. Since the phrase <em>the Word was with God</em> could also be understood to suggest that the Word is different from God, John also says, &ldquo;The Word was God.&rdquo; The Word is with God, not in the way of separation, but in the way of oneness.</p>
<p>Theologically, this verse is like a nation&rsquo;s constitution, which must be very precise in order to avoid disputes. However, it was still possible for some to debate with John by saying, &ldquo;It is correct to say that &lsquo;He was the Word,&rsquo; &lsquo;in the beginning was the Word,&rsquo; &lsquo;He was God,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;He was with God,&rsquo; but His being with God may not have been from the beginning in eternity; He may have become God only at some point in time.&rdquo; Indeed, in the second and third centuries, some were saying that the Lord Jesus obtained His divine status only at a point in time. Even some authoritative Bible expositors at the beginning of the twentieth century made this mistake, saying that the Lord Jesus was not Christ from eternity but that He became the Son of God, Christ, at a certain point in time. They could say this only if they ignored what John says in verse 2: &ldquo;He was in the beginning with God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four phrases, written by the apostle John, fully define the person of the Lord Jesus. These four solid and unshakable phrases are <em>in the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God,</em> and <em>He was in the beginning with God.</em> With these four phrases, there is no basis for dispute concerning the person of Christ. He is the Word, the Word that was in the beginning. Moreover, in His revelation He is with God, and He is God. Finally, His being with God was from the beginning, not just from a point in time. This tells us that He was not only God, but God in His coming forth. No one has ever seen God, but as the Word, the Son has declared Him (v. 18).</p><h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD<br />
BEING IN ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s relationship with God can be in one of three categories. The most superficial category involves atheists, who believe that there is no God. Such persons are superficial, and the Bible even speaks of them as fools (Psa. 53:1). The second category involves people who acknowledge God. All over the world there are many learned and thoughtful people who acknowledge God. They may not acknowledge God outwardly, because they are embarrassed or because they think that it is outdated, unfashionable, or unscientific to acknowledge God; however, they do not inwardly deny the existence of God. They are slightly deeper than those who say that there is no God.</p>
<p>Although many acknowledge God, they do not have a relationship with God. Muslims worship God, for example, but they have not received God; God has no relationship with them. They are on the earth, but God is in the heavens far from them. I have seen Muslims worship God in a mosque, and it is a very pious atmosphere. Nevertheless, when I contacted them, I did not have a sense that they touched God in their worship; their worship was in vain. Thus, this kind of relationship is not the highest category.</p>
<p>Believing in the Lord Jesus today is not a matter of joining Christianity or of receiving Christian doctrines. When we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, there was an inner assurance that we had received God; this assurance was more than just a belief in God or an acknowledgment of God. This is the top category of man&rsquo;s relationship with God.</p>
<p>Of the three categories of relationships with God, the first category is comprised of people who say that there is no God. The second category is comprised of people who acknowledge God but do not receive Him. The third and deepest category is comprised of people who acknowledge and receive God. They touch God and contact God in their spirit. They do not worship in vain; their worship touches and contacts God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING THE WORD IN ORDER TO RECEIVE GOD</h2>
<p>Those who acknowledge God but have not seen that God has come forth in Christ do not receive Him. They believe that there is a God in the universe, but they do not know that God has come forth in Christ. They know that there is God, but they do not know that this God is the Word. They acknowledge God, but they do not acknowledge the Word. This means they acknowledge that there is a Sovereign in the universe, but they do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ is this Sovereign. Furthermore, although they acknowledge the existence of an objective God, this God is not living in them subjectively as the Word. They know of an objective God in the universe, but they do not know the subjective God who is the Word.</p>
<p>This is even true of some Christians today. Although some believe in and worship God, they have little experience of God as the Word. God is only God to them, not the Word. When God is only God to us, He is objective, and our relationship with Him is not inwardly living and fresh. However, whenever God is the Word to us, speaking and living in us, we are inwardly living and fresh.</p>
<p>Once God becomes the Word in us, He is Christ. When we let God speak within us, we are filled with Christ. When brothers and sisters say, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus lives in me, and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me,&rdquo; I ask, &ldquo;How does the Lord Jesus live in you?&rdquo; It is possible for Galatians 2:20 to be a dead doctrine to us and not our living experience. Christ lives in us when He comes to us as the Word. When we have the living Word, God&rsquo;s speaking brings a deep sense that Christ is living in us.</p>
<p>The Word of God is Christ; the Word of God is God being received by us, enjoyed by us, and experienced by us. Whenever God speaks to us, He is received by us. The power of Christians is with the Word. Many cannot overcome sin because there is a lack of the living Word within them, not because of a lack of determination or effort on their part. It is a great matter that God is in man as the Word.</p>
<p>Sometimes we draw near to God in the morning to have some prayer, and in our prayer we know that God has spoken; this word is Christ. Once God speaks, our sins and indulgences fall away. Some have accepted the Lord&rsquo;s commission to preach the gospel in deserted, distant, or dangerous places, even at the cost of their lives, because God has become the Word in them, not because of the inspiration of doctrines or the motivation of men.</p>
<p>Hudson Taylor, the founder of China Inland Mission, accepted the Lord&rsquo;s commission to preach the gospel in inland China because God spoke to him as he was by the seaside. At that time God was not an objective God to him, a hidden God; He was a subjective God. Hudson Taylor then prayed and said to God, &ldquo;I accept Your commission. I accept this commission on the one hand and commit this commission to You on the other hand for You to carry it out. I would like to cooperate with You on the earth. I will not only go myself but will take many others with me to preach Your gospel in the deserted places, in the inland provinces of China.&rdquo; After he accepted the Lord&rsquo;s commission, many responded in their spirit. Some consecrated themselves for this work, and others financed it.</p>
<p>We can experience God in us as the Word not only in a great gospel move but also in the small matters of our daily life. This is a characteristic of being a Christian, and this is how Christianity is different from the religions in the world. Putting aside false religions that worship false gods, all religions in the world, even religions that worship the true God, such as Islam, are very different from Christianity: The God they worship is God but not the Word. The Muslims believe only in God but not in the Lord Jesus as God. They have only God; they do not have the Word. The God whom they worship is a hidden God, an unfathomable God. They do not have a manifested God. The God in Islam is still a God in heaven. Islam acknowledges Jesus only as a great prophet called Isa. The Muslims say that Isa was not killed or crucified but raptured alive by God to the heavens. Therefore, there is no redemption in Islam, for their Isa has not died, shed His blood, or been resurrected. They do not acknowledge Isa&mdash;Jesus&mdash;as God. Hence, the God in Islam has not come forth. In Islam God is merely God, not the Word.</p>
<p>But to us, God is not only God but also the Word. God came forth; He is Jesus Christ. We believe not only in the existence of God but also that the Lord Jesus is God. He is the manifested God, the expressed God. He is in us as the God who speaks to us. This is the difference between believing in Christ and believing in religion.</p>
<p>People involved in religion may harshly scold others after worshipping God in a pious way, but a Christian in true fellowship with God would never do such a thing. A true Christian, who has fellowship with God, who prays to God, and in whom God has become the Word, would not lose his temper after such fellowship, and he would even receive a correcting word within for having a slightly negative tone in his words and countenance. Christians not only worship the true and living God but also have the true and living Word.</p>
<p>No matter how much Muslims worship God, there is no response from God inwardly. They are very pious in their worship of God, but they have no speaking of God inwardly. In contrast, Christians may worship God for just ten minutes but become more joyful as soon as they begin to pray. They may also be touched inwardly in regard to their attitude toward their spouse and children. The more they pray, the more living they are within, and the more proper, bright, and joyful they become. Even others will sense a warmth that is unrelated to human teachings or religious dogmas, a warmth that is related to God becoming the Word in them and speaking in them.</p>
<p>We must know that the Lord is the Word; He and God are inseparable. We all have the sense that God is within us when He is speaking in us. The Word is with God, and when the Word is in us, God is in us. Practically speaking, when we do not have the Word, we do not have God. Whenever we experience the Word, we experience God. We also have a deep sense that the Word in us is God. We may have had a concept that God is in the heavens and that we are on the earth, but when we pray to Him, we sense the Word within us. We feel sweet within, and we feel that the God in heaven is also in us. Thus, to us, the Word is with God, and the Word is God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>John says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (John 1:4). <em>Him</em> refers to the Word, not God. Life is in the Word. If God were just God objectively, He could never be our life; He would be hidden and unfathomable to us. However, God is the Word; He has come forth. Furthermore, the Word is not separate from God; rather, the Word is with God and is God Himself. Life is in the Word; whenever we have the Word, we have life, and we are living, fresh, strong, and full of joy.</p>
<p>Regrettably, some Christians only understand doctrines with their mind, but doctrines are powerless and ineffective because they are not with God. The only thing that is effective is the Word that is with God and the Word that is God. Without being the Word, God would have nothing to do with us. Any word that is not with God and that is not God is dead. We want God, but we want God as the Word even more. We want to hear the Word that is with God, not a word that is without God, much less a word that is not God. Many sermons in Christianity convey words that are without God and that are not God. We are for the Word that is with God and the Word that is God. Without this Word, we cannot touch God. Any word that is without God is an empty word; it is only dead letter without life. Only the Word that was in the beginning, the Word that is with God and is God, is life. What we are touching and sensing today is not only the Word but the Word that is with God and the Word that is God. This Word is God Himself, and in this Word there is life; thus, the Word is living.</p>
<p>The Word is indeed mysterious and great. The most powerful and vital thing is God&rsquo;s coming as the Word. This Word is with God, this Word is God, and life is in this Word.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIFE BEING IN THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1-4</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will pay attention to the first half of John 1:4, which says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that if sensible and thoughtful people only acknowledge the fact that there is God in the universe, God will still be objective, distant, and mysterious to them. Acknowledging God does not mean that they have contacted, touched, or obtained God. For them, God is beyond their reach. This is not only the case with ordinary people; even religious people, who devoutly worship God, will not contact or obtain God if they do not know Him as the Word. We all must know that God is no longer merely objective; He is also the Word.</p>
<p>This mysterious matter is conveyed in simple yet profound words at the beginning of the Gospel of John. In the universe God is not only God but also the Word. Without God being the Word, we would not be able to understand Him or touch Him. God can be likened to electricity. No one has ever seen electricity, but the light produced by electricity is the expression and manifestation of electricity. Electricians can study electricity only through its manifestations. This is a very good illustration. The manifestation of electricity makes electricity subjective in our lives; it is no longer merely objective to us.</p>
<p>If God did not speak, express, or manifest Himself, He would be unapproachable, incomprehensible, uncontactable, and unobtainable. Thankfully, the Bible tells us that God is not only God but also the Word (v. 1). He is God as the Word, and He is God coming to us as the Word. A word is an utterance. If a person stands on a podium and says nothing, no one will know his thoughts or feelings. However, as soon as he opens his mouth to speak, words will come forth from within him. The more he speaks, the more his person will be manifested. The more he speaks, the more transparent his utterances will be and the more people will understand him. Hence, God&rsquo;s being the Word and God&rsquo;s coming as the Word are God being declared. As the Word, God is no longer a hidden, mysterious God but the God who comes forth. This manifested God, who speaks forth Himself, is our Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus bears a particular title in the Bible&mdash;<em>Word.</em> John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus, in whom we believe, is not separate from God. He is God Himself; He is God coming forth and being manifested. Therefore, the Bible speaks of Him being the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory (Heb. 1:3), just as light is the effulgence of electricity.</p>
<p>Some say that it would be easier to understand John 1:1-2 if we substituted <em>Lord</em> for <em>Word:</em> &ldquo;In the beginning was the Lord, and the Lord was with God, and the Lord was God. The Lord was in the beginning with God.&rdquo; However, John did not write in this way, because if he spoke only of God as the Lord, a sense of God&rsquo;s coming forth would not be conveyed. God is the Word in order to come forth.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Word, God&rsquo;s coming forth. When the hidden God is revealed, He is revealed as the Word, and the Word who was manifested is the Lord Jesus. In the Lord Jesus, God as the Word came forth to manifest and release Himself in order to be comprehended, known, understood, contacted, and obtained by man. Thus, the Lord Jesus is particularly named the Word. He is the utterance of God, the declaration of God; He is God coming forth to be received and obtained by man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING THE WORD THAT MAN MAY HAVE LIFE</h2>
<p>John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; In the God who came forth, there was life; in the God who was manifested and expressed, there was life. In God as the Word, there was life. God is the Word in order for man to have life. Without God being the Word, man would have no way to receive Him as life. Man would be able to worship, fear, thank, and praise God, but he would not be able to receive God as life. In order for God to be man&rsquo;s life, He must be the Word to come forth to man, among man, and into man.</p>
<p>Whenever we think of God, our natural concepts always involve fearing Him, worshipping Him, serving Him, or doing good to please Him. We never think of life. Everyone in the world thinks of God in this way, because the thought of God being life is not a human concept; it is a divine concept. The apostle John, however, received a revelation and burden from God to present this exceedingly mysterious matter in simple words. He revealed that God did not desire to withhold Himself from man but that He was the Word who could come forth as the Word and in whom was life. I hope that we can fully understand that God is the Word in order that man can obtain God as life.</p>
<p>When I was a new believer in the Lord, I would act very devoutly whenever I read the Bible, especially the Gospels. I would kneel down and solemnly pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Lord who created heaven and earth. You are my Redeemer. I will now read Your biography, Your Gospels. I hope to meet You here.&rdquo; Even though I regarded the Gospels as the Lord&rsquo;s biography, I would always be surprised by what I read because the Lord who is presented in the Gospels was not according to my concept. I considered Him to be a glorious Lord, full of majesty and power, but the Bible showed that He was so approachable. He talked with children (Mark 10:13-16; Matt. 19:14), walked by the sea (4:18; 15:29; Mark 2:13), and went to the mountains (13:3). When a Samaritan woman was drawing water from a well, He asked her for a drink (John 4:7). The Gospels rarely speak of Him in a high and lofty way.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John tells us that He is the Word. The unbelievers do not understand the significance of the Lord being the Word, and even Christians do not understand. The Word is God&rsquo;s utterance. When we read the Gospels, we should realize that the descriptions contained in the Gospels are the utterances of God. As the Word, Christ is the coming forth of God in order for God to be received through hearing. God does not want man to worship and serve Him objectively. God&rsquo;s only desire is for man to receive Him. The Lord Jesus was truly unique on the earth because He was the Word of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL OF JOHN REVEALING<br />
THE LORD AS THE WORD SO THAT MAN MAY HAVE LIFE</h2>
<p>Chapters 3 through 6 of the Gospel of John reveal that the Lord is the Word so that man may have life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Case in John 3</h2>
<p>John 3 begins by speaking of Nicodemus, who was a very orthodox Jewish religionist. Nicodemus realized that Jesus the Nazarene was unique, but he also knew that many people despised Him. Consequently, he was uncomfortable visiting Him during the day. Instead, he came to see the Lord Jesus secretly at night, respectfully calling Him Rabbi, which means &ldquo;teacher.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;You have come from God as a teacher&rdquo; (v. 2). When the Lord responded, He did not arrogantly say, &ldquo;I am not merely a rabbi, I am superior to the rabbis; I am God, the Lord who created all things.&rdquo; There was no sense of such an attitude from the Lord. Instead, He said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 3). The Lord Jesus did not speak of Himself as being God or even the Lord. Instead, His speaking was related to man&rsquo;s receiving of Him.</p>
<p>As soon as Nicodemus heard the Lord Jesus, he was not afraid to speak further. When the Lord said, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God,&rdquo; Nicodemus asked, &ldquo;How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, can he?&rdquo; (v. 4). The Lord Jesus explained, saying, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (v. 6). The Lord told Nicodemus that &ldquo;being born anew&rdquo; was not related to the flesh, to entering into his mother&rsquo;s womb a second time. This would not only be impossible, but it would be useless because that which is born of the flesh would still be flesh. Only the human spirit can be born again of the Spirit. When Nicodemus heard this, he immediately asked, &ldquo;How can these things be?&rdquo; (v. 9). The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You are a teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things?...As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 10, 14-15). The conversation between Nicodemus and the Lord does not convey the impression that Nicodemus had met the high God, because Nicodemus met the Word, the God who has come forth. John then revealed that those who believe into Him as the Word have eternal life.</p>
<p>The Lord told Nicodemus that He did not come as God to be worshipped or as the Lord to be served. Moreover, He did not even come to be a teacher. Rather, just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, the Lord came to be lifted up, to die, so that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life. He has come as the Word of God to utter God, to release God, to declare God so that man may receive and obtain God. In Him, as the Word, was life; when man obtains the Lord as the Word, he obtains life. The Lord Jesus did not come as God or as the Lord but as the Word; He came so that man may have life (10:10). The Lord is God&rsquo;s utterance, God&rsquo;s coming forth; in Him is life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Case in John 4</h2>
<p>John 4 shows a different picture. Chapter 3 speaks of an orthodox religionist, whereas chapter 4 speaks of an improper and superstitiously religious woman. She was religious and worshipped God, yet she had had five husbands, and the one she was currently with was not her husband (v. 18). Even though she was living a defiled life, she could talk about religion in a superstitious way. She was completely different from Nicodemus. In the preceding chapter there is a proper person; in this chapter there is a dishonorable woman. In the preceding chapter there is a human being seeking the Lord Jesus; in this chapter the Lord Jesus is seeking a human being.</p>
<p>When the woman went to draw water, the Lord Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Give Me something to drink&rdquo; (v. 7). The Samaritan woman marveled and said, &ldquo;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?&rdquo; (v. 9). Then the Lord talked to her in an ordinary manner, going back and forth with questions and answers. The woman did not have any sense that the One in front of her was God, the Savior. As their conversation progressed, the Lord let the woman know that He had what she needed&mdash;living water that quenches the thirst of human beings. The woman immediately said, &ldquo;Sir, give me this water&rdquo; (v. 15). The Lord Jesus is truly the Word; as the Word, He is God&rsquo;s utterance, God&rsquo;s explanation, so that man may be clear concerning God. The woman was at first unclear concerning spiritual matters, but when she heard the Lord&rsquo;s speaking and learned of the Lord being living water, she asked Him for this water. God spoke, and this woman met the One who is the Word. The Lord Jesus knew that she wanted living water, so He said, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here&rdquo; (v. 16). The woman was clever and covered up her situation with facts, saying, &ldquo;I do not have a husband&rdquo; (v. 17). Knowing this, the Lord said, &ldquo;You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). The Lord&rsquo;s word touched her history and her living; her whole secret story was in the light. This shows that there is life in the Word and that this life becomes the light of men when it enters into men.</p>
<p>Once the Lord Jesus spoke these words to the woman, she understood. The Lord Jesus manifested Himself to her not as God or as the Lord but as the Word. In the Word was life; once man touches the Word and believes the Word, he touches life. The Lord said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly&rdquo; (10:10). In other words, the Lord did not come for man to worship Him, to serve Him, or to do good. The Lord came so that man may have life and may have it abundantly. The Lord gives man life in the Word. When man comes to the Lord, he sees God coming forth as the Word. Man meets the Lord by touching the Word.</p><h2 class="head2">The Case in John 5</h2>
<p>John 5 describes the condition of a man who is dead in religion. Although the Jewish religion had the holy city, the holy temple, and the Holy Scriptures, as well as religious feasts, a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered were lying by the five porticoes of a pool near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem, waiting for the water to be moved by an angel (vv. 2-3). The blind could not see, the lame could not walk, and the withered were half dead. This speaks of man&rsquo;s condition in dead religion. If the Lord Jesus had come to such ones in dead religion and had majestically said, &ldquo;I am God; you should worship Me,&rdquo; the blind would have said, &ldquo;I would like to worship You, but how can I worship when I cannot see?&rdquo; The lame would have said, &ldquo;I would like to worship You, but how can I worship when I am lame?&rdquo; and the withered would have said, &ldquo;I would like to worship You, but how can I worship when I cannot get up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thank God that the Lord Jesus did not come as such a God. Instead, He went to a man who had been a paralytic for thirty-eight years and said softly, as an ordinary man would, &ldquo;Do you want to get well?&rdquo; (v. 6). The man sorrowfully said, &ldquo;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me&rdquo; (v. 7). Dead religion has many methods, yet all these methods require man&rsquo;s strength in order for them to be carried out; thus, such methods were useless for the impotent man, who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years. The paralytic told the Lord Jesus about his miserable condition without any sense that the One before him was God. The Lord Jesus listened to him and said, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk&rdquo; (v. 8). When the paralytic received the Lord as the Word, he immediately took up his mat and walked. In the Lord, who is the Word, there is life. He did not come as God to be worshipped; He did not come as the Lord to be served. He came as the Word so that man may have life. This Word is life and resurrection. &ldquo;The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live&rdquo; (v. 25). Those who hear the Word will live; those who touch the Word will rise up. This is a mysterious matter.</p>
<p>I am afraid that even though many among us have been saved for a while, our concept is still that the Lord Jesus is merely a great God, a glorious Lord whom we should worship and serve. We do not have the concept that the Lord is the Word as well as God and the Lord. When we touch Him, we touch not only God but also the Word, the God who has come forth. When we touch the Lord as the Word, we obtain life in the Word. These are two totally different matters.</p>
<p>I knew a brother who would speak to his wife and children on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, saying, &ldquo;We should put on our best clothes, and polish our shoes because our family is going to the worship service.&rdquo; Then he would give one child five dollars and another four dollars, saying, &ldquo;Keep this with you and give it when the church collects donations.&rdquo; The whole family would then go to worship God. After the service they would return home, and the wife would say in the afternoon, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s invite our aunts over and play mah-jongg,&rdquo; and the children would say, &ldquo;We saw an advertisement about a good movie in the newspaper today.&rdquo; It is possible to worship God without touching God as the Word. If they touched God as the Word, they would be made alive and would not be able to play mah-jongg or watch movies.</p>
<p>Is our gathering together for the purpose of having a worship service or for touching the Word of God? Man may worship God and serve the Lord outwardly, but only touching the Word gives life to man. If we touch the Word even once in a meeting, our whole being will be different because life is in the Word. With one touch of the Word, the paralytic could walk, the blind could see, the weak could be strong, the dead could resurrect, and the mah-jongg lovers could overturn their mah-jongg tables. There is life in the Word and great power in the life. This is to believe in the Lord Jesus. We need to see the difference between religion and the Lord Jesus, the difference between Christianity and the Word of God.</p>
<p>We absolutely acknowledge our Lord Jesus as the glorious God, the Lord of all. But please bear in mind that the Gospel of John shows His reaching us, not just as God or the Lord but as the Word. Furthermore, what He speaks into us as the Word of God is still just God Himself. God does not want us merely to worship Him, fear Him, or serve Him; God wants us to touch Him to obtain the life that is in Him. Once God is obtained by us, every problem is solved.</p><h2 class="head2">The Case in John 6</h2>
<p>In John 6 we see a picture related to man&rsquo;s livelihood. In this chapter there were crowds by the sea waiting to be fed and who were willing to make the Lord king by force. This is altogether related to man&rsquo;s livelihood. Although many of us would have been happy to be made king, the Lord did not want to be such a king. He did not come to be such a king but to be the Word. In some situations He would not even perform miracles. To the crowds He said, &ldquo;Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you&rdquo; (v. 27). He also said, &ldquo;Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die&rdquo; (vv. 49-50). This again speaks of the Lord being the Word. The picture in chapter 6 shows that the Lord did not want man to worship Him as God nor to serve Him as the Lord; He wanted to be the Word, the bread of life, to be received and obtained by man as life.</p>
<p>Then the Lord said, &ldquo;The bread which I will give is My flesh&rdquo; (v. 51). The people could not understand the Lord&rsquo;s word and asked, &ldquo;How can this man give us His flesh to eat?&rdquo; (v. 52). Then He said, &ldquo;Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life...For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink&rdquo; (vv. 53-55). This created even more confusion, but the Lord explained, saying, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). This shows that the Lord was the Word. He was the Word, and in Him was life. The bread of life that the Lord spoke of was the Word, which contained the nourishment of life in order for man to have life.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, however, many of the disciples found the word too hard to accept and went back one by one (vv. 60, 66). Jesus, therefore, said to the disciples who remained, &ldquo;Do you also want to go away?&rdquo; Simon Peter answered Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 67-68). Peter often spoke nonsense, but this time he spoke clearly. This is the very life that we want to receive; this is the eternal life that is in Him as the Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING MADE ALIVE<br />
WHEN HE TOUCHES LIFE IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (1:1). This Word was in the beginning with God (v. 2). All things came into being through Him, and in Him was life (vv. 3-4). He is the Word to utter God forth and to speak God into man. Once this Word enters into man, man touches life. Once man has life, he is made alive, and he is fed, strong, assured, and restful.</p>
<p>When we come to a meeting, we often are not full of joy, but as soon as we touch the Word in the meeting, we are released, strengthened, and uplifted. We may come dead, but we become living when we touch the Word. We may come sorrowful and full of heavy burdens, but we become joyful, and our heavy burdens fall away when we touch the Word. We may dislike a brother, but he becomes lovely to us when we touch the Word. We have many such experiences when we touch God as the Word.</p>
<p>We should not touch life only when we meet; we should also touch life when we pray. Many Christians have a concept that we should pray to a high and lofty Lord. They think that prayer is related to worshipping Him from afar and that we have no relationship with Him. Such prayers are not proper Christian prayers. Proper prayers touch God, who is speaking as the Word in our spirit; we should touch God, who is the Word. When we touch Him, we touch the Word, and when we touch the Word, we are enlivened. When we pray in this way, we will be connected to Him, and we will be full of light. Furthermore, we will be inwardly strengthened and satisfied.</p>
<p>We also need to touch life when we read the Bible. Many feel that the Bible is the word that the God of heaven has given to us and that we should piously kneel and read it. After reading in this way, however, we will still feel that God is far from us. We should read the Bible to touch God, who is the Word, in order to receive the life that is in the Word. Once we touch the Word, we will have life.</p>
<p>As Christians, we should touch God as the Word in our gatherings, in our prayers, in our Bible reading, and in our daily life. As we walk on the street, we can contact Him and touch Him as the Word. He will enter into us and speak Himself into us to be our life. This is true Christian worship. The worship that we render to God is different from the worship rendered to God by people in various religions. People in all religions worship a distant God, and there is no contact between them and God, because God is not the Word to them. However, the worship that we render to God involves touching God by worshipping in our spirit because He is the Word in us. Our God is not only God but also the Word. In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God, and in Him was life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIFE BEING THE LIGHT OF MEN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 8:12; 9:5; 12:46; Psa. 36:9</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING THE WORD<br />
TO BE CONTACTED AND OBTAINED BY US</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that life is in the Word. In this chapter we will see that this life is the light of men. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; God being the Word means that God comes forth so that we can comprehend, contact, and obtain Him. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; In this God, who is the Word, is life. Whenever we touch Him and obtain Him, we are enlivened inwardly. We can all testify that when we were saved we touched life, and God was no longer objective to us; He became subjective to us. He is no longer a mysterious, untouchable, unfathomable God but a God who has entered into us as the Word for us to practically contact and obtain. When God contacts us as the Word, we become living, strong, and spontaneously transformed in life. Hence, we can testify that we have life in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING LIGHT TO SHINE IN US</h2>
<p>After speaking of life being in the Word, John continues, saying, &ldquo;The life was the light of men&rdquo; (v. 4). The life in the Word was the light of men. <em>The life was the light</em> is a great word. No comparable word can be found in any book by philosophers or in the various religious writings in the world. The life is the light, and wherever there is life, there is light. Conversely, death is darkness, and wherever there is death, there is darkness. When a person touches death, he is in darkness. Since the life is the light, those who are full of life also have the shining of light. Whoever has life also has light, but whoever loses the sense of life within becomes inwardly dead and dark.</p>
<p>The most wonderful aspect of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; salvation is that God is no longer hidden in mystery. He did not remain in eternity; He is the Word who uttered Himself forth, speaking Himself into His believers. The Christian life begins with believing in the gospel. The gospel is the word of God; the gospel is God speaking to us. The content of the gospel is the Lord Jesus Himself. When we heard the gospel and were moved, we contacted the Spirit, we contacted the Lord Jesus, and we contacted God. When we opened to the Lord and believed in Him, receiving the word of the gospel, we received God Himself. Our believing and receiving made us living. We may have been sorrowful, but we became joyful when we received the word of the gospel. We may have been depressed, even to the point of considering suicide, but we were uplifted within when we received the word of the gospel. We felt that we were inwardly full of light, and we were willing to live on the earth for God. Furthermore, we also discovered the strength and limitlessness of this life. When we received the word of the gospel, we received the life in the Word. Now we can endure what others cannot endure and bear what others cannot bear, because God as the Word has entered into us to be our life. This life enables us to live a heavenly life on earth, living a life that others cannot live and taking a way that others cannot take.</p>
<p>We also can testify that whenever we touch this life, light shines brightly within us. Before we believed in the Lord, we were not only dead but fully in darkness. Our way was uncertain, and our life was without meaning. Our whole being was in darkness and filled with sorrow, pain, oppression, dejection, hopelessness, and utter despair. We were dead and in darkness until we heard the gospel, believed in the Lord, and received His word into us. Then we were enlivened and filled with light. We became inwardly clear, and the light within us was shining and illuminating the way of glory before us. Our life became bright and full of hope. The shining of light, which began in this age, will continue to the next age and from today unto eternity. This is indeed marvelous.</p>
<p>Proverbs 4:18 says, &ldquo;The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, / Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.&rdquo; The light of dawn has been rising in us since the day of our salvation. The more we draw near to the Lord Jesus, have fellowship with Him, pray to Him, read His Word, and live in the Spirit, the brighter the shining will be in us. It is like the rising sun at dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until the full day. The light within us shines not only upon great matters but also upon small matters. From things high to low, the light shines on everything. When the light shines, nothing is in the dark, and nothing is unclear and confused. All things related to our parents, our spouse, our children, our relatives, our colleagues, and even our clothing, food, housing, transportation, and money become transparent and clear. When we are in the light, we know where we are, what we should do, and where we are going. This is the condition of those who have the light that comes from receiving the life that is in the Lord as the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">OUTWARD WORSHIP AND SERVICE TO GOD<br />
BEING A NATURAL CONCEPT</h2>
<p>We need revelation, vision, and light so that we may be delivered from our natural religious concept. According to our concept, we were far from God, living without a fear of God, walking in a loose way, and doing many dubious things. After believing in the Lord, we think that we must learn to fear God, reject evil, and do good in order to please God. With such a concept, we focus on outward things. For example, we make a determination to worship every Lord&rsquo;s Day, to have a family worship time at home, to be meek and humble, to be full of love by helping others, and to be well-behaved by not troubling others. We make a list of regulations for ourselves, and we even kneel down and pray, &ldquo;Lord, lend me a helping hand. It will not be easy for me to do all these things, so help me. I want to please You.&rdquo; These natural religious concepts are based on the thought that God is far away in the heavens and that He is dignified, majestic, glorious, and worthy of our worship. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day, Christians &ldquo;go to church&rdquo; to worship Him. Regardless of what is being preached, they care only for one thing&mdash;&ldquo;going to church&rdquo; to worship God.</p>
<p>This was precisely my condition when I was young and I believed in the Lord. At first, I blindly believed that God was far away and sitting in heaven. As I progressed on my spiritual journey, I sensed more and more that He was also living in me. He lived in me and spoke in me, and His words were light. Slowly my concepts began to change. Now I realize that the Bible does not speak of God wanting man to worship Him as a lofty God in heaven. Rather, it reveals that as the Word, God was incarnated to enter into man on earth, to mingle with man as one, and to be man&rsquo;s life. This is the relationship that God desires.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING THAT MAN RECEIVE HIM AS LIFE</h2>
<p>God is not focused on man worshipping or serving Him; He is focused on man receiving Him as life and letting Him live in him and be his life. When I saw this, I felt that the Bible is filled with the matter of life from the first page to the last. In Genesis God placed man in front of the tree of life after He created man. This indicates that He wanted man to receive life. When the Lord came to the earth, the apostle John said, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (John 1:4). The Lord also said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly&rdquo; (10:10). At the end of the Bible, the tree of life is growing on this side and on that side of the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1-2). The fruit of the tree of life is for man to eat, and the water of life is for man to drink. God wants to fill man and to be enjoyed by man.</p>
<p>This light has become brighter and brighter in me. I am clear that God wants to be our life. God does not want us to do anything but receive Him as our life. I hope that we all can have a change in concept not to limit our believing in the Lord to the matter of outward worship. This is not to say that worshipping God is wrong but that such worship cannot satisfy God fully. Our Lord not only wants us to worship Him but also to receive Him as life. Worshipping Him is secondary; receiving Him as life is primary. Without receiving Him as life, we have no way to be proper worshippers.</p>
<p>We all know that certain things can be done only by a certain life. For example, a bird can fly in the air because it has a bird&rsquo;s life, and a fish can swim in the water because it has a fish&rsquo;s life. Worshipping God is an even more specialized matter than flying in the air or swimming in the water. Hence, we must have God&rsquo;s life in order to worship and serve God. Without God&rsquo;s life, we cannot worship or serve God. Worshipping God is a particular function that comes out of God Himself.</p>
<p>The worship that God wants from us is the worship that is the result of His entering into us. While people in the world do not understand this, those who have obtained God&rsquo;s life know how to worship, serve, and please God. Although it is good for us to come to the meetings with the thought of worshipping God, this is only a secondary matter. The primary matter is to touch God. He is the Word as well as the Spirit (John 4:24). Therefore, we should focus not on religious, ritualistic worship in our meetings but on contacting the Lord in our spirit. When our spirit contacts and touches God, and He speaks in us, we are made alive, and we are full of light.</p>
<p>We all need the word of God and the life of God. Whether we are deep or shallow in our experience of the Lord, we all need God to speak and to shine in us.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN BEING FILLED WITH LIGHT WHEN GOD SPEAKS</h2>
<p>The proof that God has entered into us as the Word and touched us is that we are inwardly full of light. Forgive me for saying this, but when I contact the brothers and sisters, it is not difficult to know whether or not the light of life is shining in them. I grieve for the saints when I do not sense the light from the Word in them.</p>
<p>Some are in darkness because of their corrupt nature. For example, a person&rsquo;s hateful heart may cause his being to be in darkness. Pride, self-complacence, and self-righteousness also result in darkness. Nevertheless, even a small crack in our inner being will enable God&rsquo;s word to come in and God&rsquo;s light to shine. Others are in darkness because of their unwillingness to consecrate themselves; instead, they argue with God. When God requires something in them, they calculate the cost and are unwilling to pay the price. They want to win, and they want God to lose. Their &ldquo;victory,&rdquo; however, becomes an inward veil that shuts out God&rsquo;s light. Others experience darkness because they refuse to obey God. When God wants them to take a step forward, they refuse, and their refusal becomes a veil.</p>
<p>Although improper things certainly cause us to fall into darkness, some brothers and sisters are so proper that they also have no light. In their humility and meekness there is no shining of light. I am concerned for these brothers and sisters. Sometimes I pray to the Lord, asking, &ldquo;What can be done? These brothers and sisters are so good, but they have no light.&rdquo; When I contact such ones, they are truly humble, meek, obedient, and considerate; they are good, but there is no inward shining. Although it seems as if they are familiar with every word that is spoken in a message, they do not have an open mind that would allow the words to shine in them. Some may say to themselves, &ldquo;How can a humble person like me not be inwardly bright? How can a good person like me be without light? How can a considerate person like me be inwardly dark?&rdquo; In truth, many &ldquo;humble&rdquo; persons are exceedingly proud. They do not think that they have any problems, and they never question themselves. Believing themselves to be fine, they are inwardly proud and complacent. Such ones have no light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIGHT GIVING MAN A SENSE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>When we have no light, we are dejected and dead. But if we live in the light, we are bright and full of inward vitality. The key to our condition is whether or not we have the Lord&rsquo;s word, the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Whenever the Lord speaks to us, He not only makes us living but also causes us to be full of light. When He shines within us, He fills us with a sense of life, that is, feelings related to life.</p>
<p>Before being saved, a person may argue with his wife and even feel justified and gratified when he vents his anger. However, after he is saved and the Lord is living within him, the more he quarrels, the less he is gratified. Instead, he will lose his inward sense of peace from the Lord. If he continues to argue with his wife, he will begin to lose even the sense of not being peaceful, and it will be as if he has reverted back to his condition before his salvation. Losing the sense of life is related to having no light. Since the sense of life produces light, the loss of this sense indicates that we are in darkness.</p>
<p>With the exception of avoiding great immoral and obvious sins, some Christians have no restrictions related to other matters; they can do almost anything. Nevertheless, these Christians do not have the presence of God or enjoy fellowship with the Lord. They are dull, numb, and have no inward sense of life. When such persons are asked about how they feel, they say, &ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo; However, this really means that they feel nothing. Their response is an indication that they have no fellowship with the Lord inwardly and, therefore, no light. Such ones may be weighed down with wrongdoings, yet they feel nothing. Feeling nothing is the same as being in darkness. They may even come to a meeting and hear a message, but the message will not enter into them to become the living word.</p>
<p>Normal Christians live before the Lord continuously and fellowship with the Lord daily. They are living, and they are full of light and the sense of life. They have a feeling related to the sense of life when they speak too strongly to others or when they discuss others&rsquo; affairs in a critical and judgmental manner. As soon as a thought enters their mind, they have a sense that this thought is offensive to God. This sense comes from the light that is shining in the deepest part of their being.</p>
<p>If we would live in the light, our sense will become more positive and deeper in regard to God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, to the Body of Christ, to the need of the church, and to God&rsquo;s present way. Furthermore, the Bible will become living and open to us when we read the Word. When we are living, the Bible will be living to us; when we are full of light, the Bible will be full of light to us.</p>
<p>When the light in a room is intensified, everything in the room can be seen more clearly, even the slightest amount of dust. When there is a dim light, many stains are obscured. When there is insufficient light in a room, many things escape our notice. The more our inner being is full of light, the more our inward feelings will be keen, detailed, thorough, meticulous, and transparent. Thus, our prayer, our reading of the Bible, our meetings, and even our mutual fellowship with the brothers and sisters will be full of the shining of light. If we do not experience the shining of light in our meetings and in our fellowship with the brothers and sisters, we can only be in darkness. In such a condition, we are merely &ldquo;service-goers&rdquo; in religion. God does not want &ldquo;service-goers.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING LIGHT</h2>
<p>In order for a person to receive light, he must be willing to consider his condition before the Lord. If he is willing to not trust in himself and does not think too highly of himself, the Spirit will have the ground to care for him, visit him, and speak to him.</p>
<p>God wants man to consider his ways (Hag. 1:7) and even to ask, &ldquo;What is my condition? Do I know God? Do I know God&rsquo;s heart? Do I know God&rsquo;s eternal plan? Do I know the Body of Christ? Do I know the Lord&rsquo;s way in this age? Do I know where His church is going? Do I give God the ground in my being? Do I let God examine me according to His government? Do I let God touch every point related to me?&rdquo; We must examine ourselves on every point and not trust in ourselves. If we do this, the God of mercy, the omnipresent God, the gracious God who cares for man, will speak to us. In His word there will be life, and this life will be the light of men. We will immediately sense the shining of light everywhere, and we will be full of feelings related to the sense of life. We will feel that the way we treat our wife and children is wrong. We will feel that we are wrong toward God and men. We will feel that we are wrong in our career and in our finances. Whereas we were previously ignorant of God&rsquo;s heart, we will have a keen sense of life that brings in God&rsquo;s shining light, a light that exposes what is not of God and reveals what is of God, and whereas before we had no feelings, now we will be full of feelings.</p>
<p>It is easy to think that our situation is more or less acceptable to God. It is easy to have a frivolous attitude when talking about God and God&rsquo;s way. Being in such a condition is an indication that we are lacking in discernment and that our sense of life is dull. This dullness is caused by a lack of light that comes from a shortage of life due to a lack of God&rsquo;s speaking. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may see that being a Christian is not merely a matter of being pious, being well-behaved, worshipping God, or serving God. Being a Christian is a matter of being full of light and being enlivened with God&rsquo;s life through His word.</p>
<p>The living God is within us, and He is speaking within us. He is speaking to us concerning small things as well as great things. Sometimes His speaking involves principles, and at other times His speaking concerns specific and detailed matters. He speaks of matters related to His household as well as matters related to our household. He speaks concerning the brothers and sisters as well as ourselves. His speaking within us makes us bright and living. As a result, we are full of feelings inwardly; that is, we have feelings related to everything. This is what it means to be a Christian. God is the Word and in the Word is life and this life is the light of men.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LIGHT SHINING IN THE DARKNESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:5, 9-11; 12:35-36</h1>
<p>John 1:5 says, &ldquo;The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.&rdquo; <em>The darkness did not overcome it</em> is rendered as &ldquo;the darkness did not take it&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. The word <em>overcome</em> has several meanings in Greek. First, it denotes to take, to receive, and to understand; once a thing is understood, it can be received. Second, it denotes to seize, as a policeman seizes a criminal. Third, it denotes to conquer. Therefore, in one sense, this sentence means that the darkness did not take the light or seize the light; in another sense, it means that the darkness could not overcome or conquer the light.</p>
<p>John 12:35 says, &ldquo;The light is still among you a little while. Walk while you have the light so that darkness may not overcome you.&rdquo; The phrase <em>so that darkness may not overcome you</em> is rendered as &ldquo;so that darkness may not come upon you&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version, yet the Greek word for <em>come upon</em> is the same as the Greek word for <em>overcome</em> in 1:5. <em>Come upon</em> in the Chinese Union Version does not adequately convey the meaning of this phrase; it should instead be rendered as &ldquo;so that darkness may not overcome you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;so that darkness may not conquer you,&rdquo; or &ldquo;so that darkness may not seize you.&rdquo; In 12:36 the phrase <em>believe and obey the light</em> in the Chinese Union Version is better rendered as &ldquo;believe into the light.&rdquo; By believing we enter into the light so that we may become sons of light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE LIGHT</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will focus on the matter of the light shining in the darkness. The light that shines in the darkness is the Word, that is, the God who spoke Himself forth. If God remained hidden, He could not be light to men. If electricity cannot find an outlet for its expression, there will be no light. However, when electricity finds an outlet, it is expressed as light. The light that we see is electricity, but it is no longer hidden; rather, it is manifested. Light is electricity coming forth; it is electricity being expressed. Similarly, if God had remained hidden in eternity, He would not be light to man. However, since He is not only God but also the Word, He has come forth. Furthermore, His speaking to man is His speaking of Himself to man, His speaking of Himself to be with man, and His speaking of Himself into man. Such a spoken God is light to man. We need to see several points concerning this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIGHT COMING TO SHINE</h2>
<p>First, God does not desire mere outward worship or service; He desires that we would receive and express Him as the shining of light. According to man&rsquo;s natural religious concept, God is so mysterious, authoritative, dignified, and great that He can only be worshipped. This is not a bad concept. In fact, if everyone in human society lived according to this concept, society would be much better than it is today. Nevertheless, God does not want a relationship based on our worship and service to Him as a great, but distant, God. He wants a deeper, more profound, and more subjective relationship with us. Thus, He presents Himself to us as the Word. He speaks Himself forth to be with us, to be among us, and to be in us so that He may be light in us. Whenever we contact this God, we are inwardly filled with light. When He speaks Himself into us, He enlightens us, and He makes us living. He gives us life, and He makes us living and shining. He is begotten in us as life, and He shines in us as light.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;While I am in the world, I am the light of the world&rdquo; (9:5). The Lord Jesus is signified as light. The electricity that shines in the meeting hall does not need our worship or service. The electricity shines so that we may be under its shining. If we turn off the lights in the meeting hall, we will be in darkness and chaos. The light that shines in the meeting hall causes everything to be calm and orderly. Under the light our situation is proper, orderly, and calm; this is the issue of shining. In addition, light manifests and restricts everything. Loose and unrestrained people have no light; instead, they are living altogether in darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIGHT SHINING IN THE DARKNESS</h2>
<p>Second, the light shines in the darkness. John 1:5 says, &ldquo;The light shines in the darkness.&rdquo; Verse 9 says, &ldquo;This was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.&rdquo; The true light enlightens every man in the world. Since the true light enlightens every man, the darkness into which the light shines must refer to men in the world. Men in the world are not only dark but darkness itself. The God who speaks Himself forth also shines in the darkness, in men who are darkness itself. Every unsaved person is darkness itself, and even every saved one still is darkness to a considerable degree.</p><h2 class="head2">Darkness Being to Feel Nothing</h2>
<p><em>Darkness</em> in verse 5 does not refer to outward, visible darkness but to spiritual darkness. In a simple sense, spiritual darkness involves the absence of any spiritual feelings. The light that shines within a Christian causes an abundance of rich, keen, and fine feelings. Regrettably, some brothers and sisters can go for days, weeks, or even months without having any spiritual feelings. Even if we have a routine of rising early to pray and read the Bible, going to work during the day, and going to a meeting at night but have no rich, keen, or fine feelings, we are in spiritual darkness.</p>
<p>Other Christians, however, are full of spiritual feelings. As soon as they rise in the morning, they feel that they have been loose with their words and loose in their attitudes. When they pray and read the Bible, they feel that they have not been absolute in paying a price to follow the Lord. They feel that they have followed their own preferences related to finances and clothing. In addition, they feel that their intentions and motives are not simple and pure. These feelings prove that there is light shining within them. Furthermore, their words are able to shine into others when they fellowship with others.</p>
<p>It is possible for a saint to have no feelings or to be full of feelings. Those who have no feelings are in darkness, and it is easy to be affected by their darkness. When we listen to such ones, it almost feels like darkness is seizing and conquering us. The more they speak, the more darkness envelops and floods over us. With others, however, we sense the shining of light as soon as we contact them. Everything they speak conveys a sense of light, and their speaking even brings us into the light. The more they speak, the more their light shines forth upon us and even conquers us. Their speaking causes us to become shining.</p>
<p>Being in darkness causes us to feel nothing; it causes us to be numb, to be without a feeling of thirst or hunger, and to have no sense of need or conviction. In such darkness it is easy to feel good about oneself. In contrast to being in darkness, however, the light causes us to have many feelings. It fills us with a sense of thirst and hunger, and we have no ground for feeling good about what we are in ourselves. Instead, we feel that we are unacceptable, that our words are inaccurate, that our attitude is improper, that our thoughts are unholy, that our motives are impure, that our love is impure, and that we are full of mixture in spiritual matters. Such persons are in the light, and the light is shining within them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Darkness Being Related to Death</h2>
<p>Being in darkness not only involves the loss of spiritual feelings but also the stillness of death. Light produces vitality. Wherever there is light, there is vitality. Those who are inwardly living are full of light and those who have the stillness of death and dejection are in darkness. A brother may be quiet, but quietness is different from the stillness related to death. A Christian who is lacking in spiritual vitality is in darkness, and this darkness is related to the stillness of death.</p>
<p>A meeting that lacks vitality is a meeting in darkness. I once joined a bread-breaking meeting that was scheduled to start at 7:30 in the evening, yet as the time approached 7:30, no one rose up to select a hymn. Everyone was still and quiet. At 7:40 the stillness and quietness made me almost cry. There were many seated in the meeting hall, but they were all so still, and they did not look at each other. Everyone sat in complete silence. This is what I call the stillness of death. Such deathly stillness is related to darkness. If we have light, we will weep when we encounter such situations, and we will not allow the meeting to be still for even a few minutes. We do not have to follow a set practice of selecting a hymn; instead, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on us so that we may be made alive. People in death cannot praise You. Lord, do enliven us.&rdquo; Such a prayer can enliven us with the shining of light. Light produces feelings related to life and vitality. Darkness can also hinder us from preaching the gospel in a living way or from fellowshipping freely with a brother or sister. If we have the shining of light, we will be full of inward feelings and vitality. Then in our meetings, in our preaching of the gospel, and in our fellowship with others, we will be full of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DARKNESS NOT OVERCOMING THE LIGHT</h2>
<p>Third, darkness does not overcome the light. In one sense light is very strong; it is capable of driving away darkness. However, in another sense light is very weak; it can easily be blocked by anyone who does not receive it. Hence, whether or not the light shines on us depends on whether or not we receive the light. The morning sunlight is able to break through the darkness, but one can either receive it or reject it. For example, after we rise up in the morning to pray and read the Word of God, we often receive an inner sense from the Lord. If we ignore this feeling, we will not receive the light that overcomes darkness. Likewise, when we fellowship with a brother during the day and the light in his words shines into us, we should receive it rather than closing ourselves to his speaking. When we close ourselves, we reject the light and remain in darkness. We can also reject the light that comes to us in a meeting. The speaking in the meeting may stir up a certain feeling within us. When we begin to consider the cost of responding to and receiving this speaking, however, it is easy to reject the light. Such rejection causes us to remain in darkness.</p>
<p>Genuine Christians should be in the shining of light every day. God is light, and He is shining in us. Thus, we should be full of feelings. However, we often reject this light; that is, we ignore our inner sense of life. When we reject the light, we are in darkness. Our original condition is one of darkness, and the more we preserve this condition by rejecting the shining of the light, the more we become numb and dead. The light shines in the darkness; it shines in our dark being. Whenever the light shines in us and we receive even a little of its shining, the light overcomes the darkness and changes our situation by enlivening us.</p>
<p>Many of us pray and read the Bible every day. While it is difficult to feel nothing when we pray and read the Bible, I am afraid that we reject many of the feelings that we receive. When the light shines in the darkness, we must receive it so that the light can overcome our darkness. If we respond to the shining of the light every day, we will be full of light, and everyone who touches us will feel bright and shining as well.</p>
<p>The light is very strong; it is capable of driving all darkness away. However, it is also very gentle; it can be easily rejected. There is no difference in the light that we receive and the light that we reject; it is the same light. However, there is a difference to us if we do not receive the light. We can be either bright, living, and full of feelings when we receive the light, or we can be dark and dead when we reject the light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DARKNESS NOT SEIZING THE LIGHT</h2>
<p>Fourth, the darkness cannot seize the light. However, we must seize the light. When God&rsquo;s light shines within us, it often does so little by little. There is a flash here and a manifestation there. We need to learn to be in fear and trembling lest we neglect the light. Once the light shines and we have a feeling from the Lord, we should seize it immediately. If we do not seize it, the light will fade. Hence, some brothers and sisters carry a notebook with them to write down the feelings that come from God&rsquo;s speaking and shining. Then they pray according to these feelings. If we do not seize the light, the light will fade and make no further impression on us. Many of us have had the experience of light shining upon us in the morning but fading by the time we fellowship with others at night. Therefore, we must seize the light and fix our eyes on the light. Even when we read the Bible, it is good to briefly write down the light and feelings that we have received. The shining we receive will be a supply of life that enlivens us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DARKNESS NOT CONQUERING THE LIGHT</h2>
<p>Fifth, the darkness cannot conquer the light. The darkness of man cannot conquer the light. Man may reject the light, but man&rsquo;s rejection does not negate the light. Man has no way to conquer the light. As long as the light is of God, man has no way to conquer it. The light that shines on us today will come to shine on us tomorrow; it will shine on us this month, and it will shine on us in the following month.</p>
<p>Our Lord Jesus has been shining on the earth for two thousand years. Many people reject Him and resist Him, yet they cannot overcome Him or conquer Him. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness does not overcome it. We may reject it, oppose it, or ignore it, but it is still shining. The light is shining on man because the darkness cannot overcome or conquer the light. Thus, even if some do not receive the light, others will receive it. Hence, John 1:12 says, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God.&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:12-13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">HIM</h2>
<p>John 1:12-13 says, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; Four aspects of the Lord are related to the word <em>Him.</em> First, <em>Him</em> refers to God. Second, <em>Him</em> refers to the Word (v. 1). Third, <em>Him</em> speaks of the life that is in the Word (v. 4). In 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you...are life.&rdquo; Not only is there life in the Word, but His words are life. Fourth, <em>Him</em> speaks of the life that is the light (1:4). God is the Word, the Word is life, and the life is the light. The Lord whom we believe in and receive is God, the Word, life, and light. Light is related to shining, and life is related to living. The Word is related to expression, and God is related to worship. Thus, 1:12 refers to the One who shines in us, who lives in us, who is expressed in us, and who is worthy of our worship.</p>
<p>Although these four particular aspects speak of the Lord in whom we have believed and whom we have received, these aspects of the Lord should also be realized in our experience. When we draw near to the Lord, worship the Lord, pray to the Lord, and even think of the Lord, we are filled with light. When the Lord is light in us, He shines in us, and we become bright. We also are enlivened with an inward strength. Thus, we are full of energy, joyous, and uplifted. This is our experience of touching the Lord, who is life and light.</p>
<p>As part of our experience, we should also be aware of the Lord&rsquo;s continuous speaking in us. Whenever we draw near to the Lord, pray to the Lord, and touch His presence, a sense of the Lord&rsquo;s speaking arises within us. Even though it may seem as if His speaking is ever so slight, we cannot deny this sense. This is a mysterious matter that many Christians do not understand. When we pray out of sorrow and grief, there is a speaking within us that tells us to be calm, to be at rest, and even to be peaceful. When we pray to the Lord related to our wrongdoings, there is a speaking that reminds us that we are children of God who should be above doing such unbefitting things. As a result of this speaking, we are filled with life and light. Such speaking is indeed marvelous.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can only praise and worship the Lord when we touch Him. Our praise and worship do not come out of a determination to worship the Lord who is high above, but out of our being filled with life and light through His speaking in our being. At such times we spontaneously pray, draw near to Him, and worship Him in spirit, saying, &ldquo;My Lord and my God, I worship You from my heart. I praise You from my heart. I turn to You and give myself to You completely.&rdquo; Even when we draw near to Him and receive a further rebuke, we can only declare His worthiness to be praised for His life and light.</p>
<p>Our Lord is God, the Word, life, and light. When God is manifested, He is the Word, He is the life that enters into us to enliven us, and He is the light that shines into us to enlighten us. When we touch the Lord, we experience these four aspects. This is because we cannot separate the Lord from the life that enters into us and from the light that shines into us. Furthermore, we cannot separate the Lord from the words that He speaks in our being, which lead us to worship Him as God. We are full of light because He is the light, we are living because He is the life, we are able to know Him because He is the Word, and we are led to worship Him because He is God.</p>
<p>We obtain grace and receive the Spirit when we open ourselves and let God, who is the Word, life, and light, come into us. Once He comes into us, He shines, lives, speaks, and manifests Himself as God. I believe many brothers and sisters have this kind of experience. I can testify that I have countless such experiences in a day. I can only bow my head and say, &ldquo;Lord, You are worthy to be worshipped. God, You are worthy to be praised.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Him&rdquo; whom we have received is God as the Word, coming into us as life and shining in us as our light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVED</h2>
<p>It may not seem difficult to understand the matter of receiving, because we all know how to receive a book, a glass of water, or a gift. Nevertheless, how can we receive the invisible and intangible Lord, who is God, the Word, life, and light? Knowing that we would encounter this question, John was moved by the Spirit to clarify the matter of receiving. When John wrote, &ldquo;As many as received Him,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to those who believe into His name&rdquo; (v. 12). Although we cannot see God, we know His name. He is Jesus, He is Christ, and He is the Lord; we know His name. We cannot use the excuse that we do not know His name. He is Jesus, Christ, the Lord, and God. His name is the name above all names, the transcendent name, the wonderful name, and the most glorious name in the universe. We all know His name.</p>
<p>At any time and in any place, a person who believes into the name of Jesus and calls upon the name of Jesus will receive Him as life and light. When a person believes into Him and receives Him through His name, something mysterious happens. Receiving by believing can be compared to electricity coming into a lamp and shining as light when someone turns on the light switch. It does not matter whether the person understands the principles of electricity. As soon as the switch is turned on, electrical current flows. In the same principle, we may not fully understand the matter of receiving Him, but if we believe into the name of Jesus, call upon the name of Jesus, confess the name of Jesus, and say from our heart, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are my Savior!&rdquo; something mysterious will happen within us.</p>
<p>In 1938 I was invited to preach the gospel at a junior college, where a man, who was a judge, also taught. He was not saved, and his colleagues dragged him to the meeting to hear the gospel. After my speaking, he asked many strange questions. I said, &ldquo;In order to believe in God and receive Him, studying alone will not help. Even if you truly had answers to all your questions, you would still not be saved. Instead, I hope that you would pray to the Lord Jesus when you go home.&rdquo; He took this word and agreed to try. When he returned home, he shut his door and half-jokingly knelt down on the floor and prayed, &ldquo;Jesus, if You are the true God, cause me to convict myself.&rdquo; He then confessed some sins, waiting for Jesus to appear to him. When nothing happened, he went to bed. The next morning he went to work as usual, but while he was on his way, his whole mood changed. He felt a sense of relief throughout his whole being, as if a heavy burden had been lifted from him. All his surroundings became quite lovely to him&mdash;the sky was lovely, the earth was lovely, and even the dog on the street was lovely. His heart was full of joy as he heard his court cases. From that day his whole being changed because he received the Lord as his Savior when he confessed the Lord&rsquo;s name and called upon Jesus.</p>
<p>Another brother was saved in 1947 in the church in Shanghai when we were preaching the gospel to the young people. When I finished speaking, I asked those who were touched and who wanted to believe in the Lord to stand up. This brother was a young student, and his parents, who loved the Lord very much, had dragged him to the meeting to hear the gospel. He did not want to believe, but he thought, &ldquo;I will stand up and pretend that I want to believe for the sake of my parents.&rdquo; So he stood up with the others, but as soon as he stood up, he felt the weight of his sins. His &ldquo;act&rdquo; became real, and he repented and was saved. It is difficult to even joke about believing in Jesus. It is entirely possible for a person, who jokingly pretends to believe in Jesus, to actually be captured by Jesus in the end. This is a wonderful matter.</p><h2 class="head1">BELIEVING INTO HIS NAME</h2>
<p>The name of the Lord Jesus is powerful. When our heart is full of sorrow and there is no one to whom we can talk, we simply need to call on the Lord in order for our sorrows to be lifted and our burdens to be unloaded. This is a wonderful matter. We simply need to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, and we will touch something within; that is, we will touch God, the Word, life, and light. God, the Word, life, and light are in the Spirit because the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Although it may be difficult to understand the Spirit, receiving the Spirit is very practical. Even though we may not understand electricity, we can live by it every day. God is Spirit, the Word is Spirit, life is Spirit, and light is Spirit. If we want to receive Him, we only need to fulfill the requirement of believing into His name. To believe into His name is to receive Him. We can call upon His name, saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are so lovely! Lord Jesus, You are so dignified! O Lord, You are so great! You are full of love!&rdquo; Even new believers can speak simple words, saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are so good to me! Lord Jesus, Your heart is so tender, loving, and forbearing.&rdquo; We only need to call on Him, and we will be shining, living, and full of the Word. When we call on Him, He enters into us. We know that He has entered into us, because we are living, shining, joyful, uplifted, clear, and released. In our anguish He comforts, and in our grief He supplies. When we have such experiences, we know that we have received Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING GIVEN AUTHORITY<br />
TO BECOME CHILDREN OF GOD</h2>
<p>As many as receive Him, to them He gives authority to become children of God. Whenever we receive the Lord, we receive authority. Authority is the highest matter in the universe. Although power is a great thing, authority is even greater. The power of an atomic bomb can cause great destruction, but the authority to use this power lies in the hands of the president. A display of the power of an atomic bomb depends upon an order that is backed by the authority of the president. Similarly, a car has a powerful engine, but a traffic-control policeman has authority over its power. When a policeman gives an order based on his authority, all the power of a car on the street comes under his authority. Authority prevails over power.</p>
<p>When we received the Lord, He gave us not only power but also authority. When we contact the Lord and we receive the Lord in our experience, we have authority. A person who contacts the Lord is one who not only has power but also authority. This authority is the authority to become children of God. This authority enables us to enjoy everything of God and everything in the house of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BEGOTTEN NOT OF BLOOD,<br />
NOR OF THE WILL OF THE FLESH,<br />
NOR OF THE WILL OF MAN, BUT OF GOD</h2>
<p>John 1:13 says, &ldquo;Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; Being begotten of God means that man receives God&rsquo;s nature. When we contact the Lord, God&rsquo;s nature increases in us, and the influence of our physical life, the will of our flesh, and the will of our created humanity decrease in us.</p>
<p>Our natural life, our life in the old creation, is summarized in three terms in verse 13: <em>blood, the will of the flesh,</em> and <em>the will of man.</em> According to the words in Greek, <em>blood</em> refers to the physical life of man, <em>the will of the flesh</em> refers to the will of fallen man, and <em>the will of man</em> refers to the will of created man. Although the will of man is slightly better than the will of the flesh, it is still related to man, including only the element of man. Hence, <em>not of blood</em> means not to be begotten of man&rsquo;s physical life; <em>nor of the will of the flesh</em> means not to be begotten of the will in man&rsquo;s fallen soul; and <em>nor of the will of man</em> means not to be begotten of anything related to man himself. A person who is not begotten of God can only be begotten of things related to man&mdash;blood, the will of the flesh, and the will of man.</p>
<p>We often tell the saints not to walk according to the elements of their natural man, but the more we exhort them not to live according to their physical life, the stronger this element becomes. Similarly, the more we exhort them not to live according their fallen will and human opinions, the more they express their will and opinions. The only way not to live according to our natural life is to contact the Lord. The more we draw near to the Lord, muse upon Him, praise Him, and worship Him, the more we are filled with Him, and the more we enjoy God&rsquo;s nature. When our living comes out of our being begotten of Him, we receive His authority as children of God (v. 12).</p>
<p>Our authority is God Himself, because God Himself is our life. He has given us authority to become children of God, who fully enjoy His life and His nature. This delivers us from the elements of our natural life, and the Holy Spirit even bears witness that we are begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man but of God. This is not a doctrine or a teaching but the spiritual experience of every child of God.</p>
<p>Being begotten of God has absolutely nothing to do with man&rsquo;s physical life, man&rsquo;s fallen soul, or man himself; rather, it involves God entering into man so that man may enjoy all His riches. We have authority to enjoy God every day by calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, contacting the Lord, and receiving more of Him into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GLORIOUS MATTER</h2>
<p>Whenever we call upon the Lord, praise Him, and make mention of His name, we receive Him, and we are given the right, the authority, to enjoy God Himself. This is something that does not depend on our human life, our fallen will, or our created will. Instead, He enters into us to be our life, our nature, our substance, our riches, and our all. Even though we received Him at the time of our salvation, He is unlimited. Therefore, we need to enjoy Him even more and let Him increase in us more and more. If we need strength, He will be our strength. If we need power, He will be our power. If we need comfort, He will be our comfort. If we need leading, He will be our leading. If we need light, He will be our light. If we need a word, He will be our word. He is full of riches, and we can enjoy all His riches. Being a Christian is a matter of being begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
<p>Consequently, we do not need to make resolutions, determine to do good, or desire to have power. When we enjoy Him, we have all that we need. Being a Christian is different from being an adherent of a religion. As a Christian, we do not need to improve ourselves or adjust ourselves; we only need to praise Christ more and fellowship with Him more by beholding Him, contacting Him, and calling on His name. Then we will be full of authority to enjoy our glorious Lord as life, and we will rejoice in Him, be at rest in Him, be full of praises to Him, and be shining and uplifted every day. God is life to shine in us, to speak in us, and to be our God in us. This is a glorious matter. &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; This is a glorious matter!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEGOTTEN OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:12-13</h1>
<p>John 1:12-13 says, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; This portion contains at least ten crucial points that are indicated by the following words and phrases: <em>received, Him, authority, children of God, believe into, His name, blood, the will of the flesh, the will of man,</em> and <em>begotten...of God.</em> We covered the point of receiving in the previous chapter, and now we need to consider the matter of being begotten of God. Receiving is the procedure by which we are begotten of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BEGOTTEN OF GOD BY RECEIVING THE LORD</h2>
<p>New believers often do not have an accurate understanding of the truth contained in the Bible. For example, in regard to receiving the Lord, many of us think of ourselves only as sinners who were in anguish and bondage, who were destined to perish, and who were in need of salvation and a Savior. Hence, we believed in the Lord Jesus as our Savior. This concept is quite common, and while it is not wrong, it falls short of the view contained in the Bible. The Bible shows that God wants us to receive His Son for a higher purpose.</p>
<p>Some of us also think that our believing in the Lord is for the purpose of improving our behavior. This sounds reasonable, but strictly speaking it is incompatible with the truth of the gospel. In the Lord&rsquo;s salvation the goal is not to improve our behavior. The Lord is focused on regenerating us, not improving us. Receiving the Lord is not a matter of improving our behavior but a matter of receiving another life. When we believe in the Lord, we receive another life, which spontaneously changes our living and behavior. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is focused on regeneration, not improvement.</p>
<p>Sages, philosophers, and religionists throughout the ages have focused on self-improvement. Nicodemus was a religionist who wanted to improve himself, and so he came to Jesus at night (3:1-2). But God does not want us to improve our behavior; He wants to give us His life. He does not want us to improve our life; He wants us to receive Him as life. The concept of improvement is not accurate. Although the word <em>repent</em> is in the Bible, this word in Greek refers to a change of mind, not to the improvement of behavior.</p>
<p>When we receive the Son of God as our Savior, God not only forgives our sins but also begets us. God&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins and His deliverance of us from perdition are secondary matters. The Bible shows that God redeemed us so that we could be born again. God not only saves us but also begets us. God wants to beget Himself in us. He saves us so that we could be born of Him. Salvation is secondary; begetting is primary.</p>
<p>Although unbelievers do not have this concept, even many Christians do not have this concept. This is the reason that the apostle John clearly says, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten...of God&rdquo; (1:12-13). The authority that John speaks of is the life of God. Those who have authority to become children of God are those who have been begotten of God. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God (v. 1); in Him was life, and the life was the light of men (v. 4); the light shines in the darkness (v. 5); and as many as received Him, that is, those who believe into His name, to them He gave authority, the life, to become children of God (v. 12). This is the apostle John&rsquo;s thought and concept. His emphasis in writing these words is not on the forgiveness of sins or blessings, but on the authority of life that makes believers children of God. Hence, he speaks of those &ldquo;who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God&rdquo; (v. 13).</p>
<p>We need to see how truly momentous it is to receive the Lord. Once we receive the Lord, God&rsquo;s life enters into us, and we immediately have a union with God in life. Our believing into the Lord is for our being begotten of God, that is, for God to come into us to be our life. This is not a natural concept. We would never think of God entering into us to be our life by regenerating us. In addition to our own life, we need to receive God as life. No religionist or philosopher sees that man&rsquo;s problem is related to life.</p>
<p>I hope that these words will deliver us from the concept of doing good and being moral. The Bible says, &ldquo;Who were begotten...of God.&rdquo; Once we receive the Lord, we are begotten of God. Some saints may ask, &ldquo;Although this is a good word, what about our behavior, our living, and the way we conduct ourselves?&rdquo; We should realize that our living comes out of life. Once we have God&rsquo;s life, every matter of our living is spontaneously addressed. The Gospel of John has a total of twenty-one chapters, and John carefully selected the content from thousands of events (21:24-25). In his entire Gospel there is no verse, sentence, or word that tells us how to behave. John did not address the matter of behavior; he only spoke of the matter of life because he knew that everything depended on life. Once our focus is on life, there is no problem with behavior.</p><h2 class="head1"><em>&ldquo;NOT... NOR... NOR&rdquo;</em></h2>
<p>In 1:13 the apostle John says, &ldquo;Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man.&rdquo; John emphasized the matter of begetting with three words in the negative&mdash;<em>not, nor, nor</em>&mdash;so that we would clearly know that our begetting is completely of God and that it has nothing to do with man.</p>
<p>The first of these three words refers to our body of flesh and blood. Our body is born of flesh and blood, but our spiritual birth is not related to blood. The second and third words refer to the soul-life. Man has not only an outer, visible life of flesh and blood but also an inner, invisible soul-life. The soul has three parts: mind, emotion, and will. The will of the flesh and the will of man are related to man&rsquo;s fallen will and man&rsquo;s created human will. Our thoughts represent us in terms of their expression, and our will represents us in terms of its intentions. That which is begotten of blood refers that which is begotten by flesh and blood, and that which is begotten of the will of the flesh or of the will of man refers to that which is begotten by the intentions of our soul-life.</p>
<p>The created soul-life that was present before the fall was affected by the fall; thus, there was the soul-life before the fall and the soul-life after the fall. <em>The will of the flesh</em> refers to the soul-life after the fall, whereas <em>the will of man</em> refers to the soul-life before the fall. According to John, those who believe in and receive the Lord Jesus are not begotten of blood, which speaks of the human life associated with flesh and blood, nor are they begotten of the soul-life, which was affected by the fall and which speaks of the intentions related to the fallen soul-life, nor are they begotten of the intentions that were present in our soul-life prior to the fall. The life that we have received from the Lord is not related to flesh and blood, and it is not related to the soul-life, either after or prior to the fall. It is only related to the life of God.</p>
<p>This shows that while a man of flesh and blood who has been affected by the fall certainly needs God&rsquo;s life, even a pure created man, who is not fallen and who has not been corrupted to become the flesh, would still need God&rsquo;s life. The life that we receive upon believing in the Lord is not a life related to flesh and blood; neither is it related to our soul-life, either after or prior to the fall. The life that we receive from the Lord comes to us entirely apart from anything of our human life; it is the life of God that comes from God.</p>
<p>These words should be applied to our living. After we receive the Lord and obtain God as our life, we should not live by the will of the flesh, that is, our fallen soul-life. Neither should we attempt to live by our pure, created soul-life. Our soul-life expresses both hate and love, and it is both narrow and broad. The hateful and narrow expressions of our soul-life are related to the will of the flesh, whereas the loving and broad expressions are related to the pure created will of man. Being stingy and miserly are related to the soul-life of the flesh, whereas being generous and charitable are related to the pure created will of man. Intolerance and condemnation come out of the will of the flesh, the soul-life of the flesh, whereas tolerance and magnanimity are virtues related to the will of man, the soul-life of created man. Although God&rsquo;s children know that they need to reject the will of the flesh, few know that they need to reject the will of their good humanity, that is, the good virtues of their created soul-life. Consequently, when a brother is praised for being broad-hearted or a sister is praised for being meek and loving, we may have little realization that these traits can be merely good expressions coming out of the human soul-life, not out of the life of God.</p>
<p>Many years ago a sister from the northwest came to Shanghai for fellowship and then left for Nanking after several days. I also went to Nanking a few days later. Upon my arrival, I heard several responsible brothers praising the spirituality of this sister. They said, &ldquo;This sister walks so meekly, speaks so elegantly, and sits so properly; she is truly spiritual.&rdquo; I smiled and said, &ldquo;If meekness, elegance, and properness are spirituality, then the statue of Mary in a Catholic cathedral is even more spiritual.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are confusing us. Are you saying that a person can be spiritual if he speaks with a rasping voice, hops around instead of walking, and slouches when he sits?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Of course not, but being loud or being meek and quiet are not the proper measure of spirituality. You may think that this sister is spiritual because she is quiet and meek, but you have no realization that meekness and quietness are part of her natural disposition; she was meek and quiet even before she was saved.&rdquo; According to John&rsquo;s words, this sister&rsquo;s meekness and quietness were &ldquo;begotten&rdquo; of the will of man; they were &ldquo;begotten&rdquo; by the good side of her created soul-life; they were not begotten of God.</p>
<p>Some sisters express their anger in very elegant ways, but others sound like they are quarreling even when they speak pleasant words. Neither expression is spiritual, and neither expression is begotten of God. Although our hatred, jealousy, and narrow-heartedness are not begotten of God, it is also possible for our love, magnanimity, and broad-heartedness to not be begotten of God.</p>
<p>The life that we have received from the Lord is not of man but of God. This life is not according to man&rsquo;s blood, man&rsquo;s fallen soul, or man&rsquo;s created soul. God&rsquo;s life is altogether apart from man. Just as our hatred is not out of God, our human love is not out of God. Just as our hot temper is not out of God, our human meekness is not out of God. Just as our narrowness is not out of God, our human broadness is not out of God. God wants to enter into us to be our life, and with His life we have authority to become children of God. Becoming children of God is not only a matter of nature, position, or name; it is a matter of enjoyment. We can enjoy everything of God when we become children of God. All His riches are our blessing and our right.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD BECOMING FLESH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14; Exo. 25:8; 40:17, 34; Psa. 78:60; Rev. 21:2-3; 2 Cor. 4:7; 1 Tim. 3:16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING FLESH<br />
BEING GOD BECOMING MAN</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;The Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; <em>Word</em> refers to God, whereas <em>flesh</em> refers to man; hence, the Word becoming flesh means that God became a man. God became man so that God and man could be mingled together as one. Before the Word became flesh, that is, before God became man, God was God and man was man. God was in the heavens, and man was on the earth. There was no union or mingling of God and man. They were separate from one another. In the Old Testament no matter how much God contacted man or how much man drew near to God, God was God and man was man; God was not in man and neither was man in God. Then one day a wonderful, mysterious thing happened in the little town of Bethlehem&mdash;God became a man. At this point, God and man were no longer separate from each other; rather, God and man were joined and mingled as one.</p>
<p>God becoming man is a mysterious matter. The world does not understand this matter, and even very few Christians understand it. The world celebrates Christmas, but it is often nothing more than an opportunity for music and dancing to indulge the flesh. However, even pure-hearted, God-venerating Christians do not understand the significance of Bethlehem. Although they know that a Savior was born in Bethlehem, they do not see the mystery of this birth. When our Savior was born, God came to be among men by becoming a man in the flesh. The mysterious, unsearchable, unfathomable, unapproachable God entered into humanity, not only to be joined with man, but to become a genuine man. This is the significance of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; being born in Bethlehem. From that point forward, God has been joined and mingled with man; God and man are one, and now humanity as well as divinity can be found in God.</p>
<p>Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6 contain prophecies concerning the Word becoming flesh. These two verses are so mysterious that even Isaiah himself may not have understood them. Verse 14 of chapter 7 says, &ldquo;The virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; A virgin of flesh and blood bore a son, whom men would call Emmanuel, which is translated &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (Matt. 1:23). Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / ...And His name will be called / ...Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; The Son who was born to us and given to us is the Eternal Father, the source. The Son who was born in time is the Father outside of time. Although He was a child in a manger, He is the Mighty God.</p>
<p>Seven hundred years before Christ was born, Isaiah was moved by the Holy Spirit to prophesy concerning this mystery. At the appointed time, David&rsquo;s descendant, Mary, a virgin of flesh and blood, gave birth to a child who was the Mighty God. This child was not only the Son who was given, but also the Eternal Father, the source. Human language cannot fully express this mystery. I hope that in our spirit we would understand the mystery of Christ&rsquo;s birth in Bethlehem. A great event, greater than the creation of all things, took place that day: the creating God entered into the created man; the Creator and the created were joined as one.</p>
<p>The greatest matter in the universe is not creation or redemption but incarnation, that is, the entering of God into man to be one with man. The creation of all things is not as significant as the incarnation; even the accomplishment of redemption is not as significant. Incarnation is the center, the watershed event in the universe. Prior to the incarnation, God was not joined to or mingled with man. After the incarnation, God was joined to and mingled with man as one. Nothing is greater than this in the universe.</p>
<p>Many people treasure the Lord being crucified for them and shedding His blood for the redemption of their sins, but they have little regard for His incarnation. It is easy for people to be moved to tears when they hear about the Lord Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross. However, they often have no depth of feeling related to the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation. It is not easy for us to worship the Lord by giving thanks and praises to Him for His incarnation. May God give us a vision so that we see that God becoming man is the most glorious and mysterious matter in the universe. The distinguishing feature of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; birth is that the Creator entered into His creature, a created man. God became a man; the Word became flesh.</p>
<p>We should not think that God became anything other than a genuine man. He was not some sort of superior man; He was a man in the flesh. Although there was no corruption of sin in Him, He suffered from the temptation of sin and the affliction of the world (Heb. 2:18; 4:15). God became a man, but the man He became was not the perfect, beautiful man that God first created but a man afflicted by Satan, sin, and the world. Though sinless in His nature, His outward form was not attractive. Isaiah 52:14 says, &ldquo;His visage was marred more than that of any man, / And His form more than that of the sons of men.&rdquo; Verse 2 of chapter 53 says, &ldquo;He grew up... /...like a root out of dry ground. / He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.&rdquo; The man that God became was not outwardly presentable, but rather a man with no attracting form nor majesty.</p>
<p>In the universe a great thing was realized when the Lord was born in Bethlehem. God entered into man, becoming a man and being joined to and mingled with man. From that day forward, there has been One who is both God and man and man and God. This is a mysterious matter.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECOMING FLESH BEING<br />
GOD EXPRESSING HIMSELF THROUGH THE FLESH</h2>
<p>John 1:14 does not say, &ldquo;God became man;&rdquo; rather, it says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s speaking of God as the Word shows that the term <em>Word</em> is a further unveiling of God; thus, this utterance is more advanced. Some theologians may condemn this utterance as heretical, but we should not deviate in our understanding because of them. We must recognize that there is a distinction between God as the Word and God as God. Although there is no difference in element, God as the Word is more distinctive than God as God. While God is the substance of the Word, the Word is the uttered God. If God was not the Word, we would not even know Him as God, but we know Him as God because He is the Word, the uttered God.</p>
<p>The Word becoming flesh indicates that the uttered and declared God, who is eternally being spoken forth as the Word, has become flesh as well. As the eternal Word, God is sufficiently expressed and declared, but this expression became much more substantial when He, as the Word, became flesh. When the Word became flesh, God began to speak in the flesh, to be manifested in the flesh, and to be declared through the flesh. This is too glorious.</p>
<p>The Word became flesh in order to substantiate the declaration and the expression of God. Although He is eternally the Word, that is, the explanation and expression of God, He now expresses God even more substantially through the flesh and in the flesh. This is the key to the Gospel of John, which shows a human of flesh, who was also the Word of God, in action. God Himself is now expressed and uttered forth in the flesh. Although His visage was marred more than that of any man and His form more than that of the sons of men, having had no attracting form nor majesty and coming out of a little town, Nazareth, God as the Word was manifested in the flesh. As the Word, God was substantially expressed in the flesh.</p>
<p>We know that the heavens declare the glory of God, the expanse proclaims the work of His hands (Psa. 19:1), and the words of the Bible reveal God so that man may know God. The expression of God through the heavens, the earth, all things, and even in the words of the Bible is not as expansive as the expression of God that was declared through Jesus, who is the incarnate Word (John 21:25). When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was a little man from a carpenter&rsquo;s home in a little town, and His visage was marred more than that of any man. Like a root out of dry ground, He had no attracting form nor majesty. Nevertheless, even as a lowly man, He expressed God much more than what can be declared through the heavens and the earth and what is contained in the words in the Bible. The twenty-one chapters of the Gospel of John depict the expression of God in a lowly man, the Lord Jesus. This lowly man in the flesh substantiated the Word of God. He explained God not only through His speaking but also through His entire living, work, and person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE ASPECTS OF INCARNATION</h2>
<p>God delights in entering into man, in being mingled with man, and in being expressed through man&rsquo;s manner of living. This is the greatest mystery associated with Christians. God delights in entering into man. God also delights in being mingled with man such that God and man and man and God are one. Furthermore, God delights in being declared through man&rsquo;s manner of life. Although a Christian is a man, he should declare God. God does not want a Christian to be a man declaring man, nor God declaring God, but a man declaring God. These three points are very significant and mysterious.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John speaks of the most wonderful person in the universe. This person is wonderful because God entered into the man Jesus and was mingled with Him as one. Now we can say that He is a man, because He is a genuine man. We also can say that He is God, because He is the true God. In Him God and man are mingled together and are inseparable. This wonderful person is the Jesus who is shown in the Gospel of John. Jesus is both God and man. In Him God and man are mingled as one. He did not come to man just as God, He came to man as man to express God. Thus, He did not express man but God through man. Although He lived in the flesh, He expressed the Word of God, because He lived in the flesh by the life of God, not by the life of man. He was a man, but His human living was out of the divine life. Hence, even though He was a man, He expressed God. He was both God and man; He was a man in His actions and living, yet in His actions and living God was expressed. He expressed God in the flesh. This is the meaning of incarnation.</p>
<p>The One who asked the Samaritan woman for water at Jacob&rsquo;s well was both God and man (4:7). When He asked for water, He asked as a man. If He had come only as God, the Samaritan woman would have fallen to the ground, rather than asking, &ldquo;How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman?&rdquo; (v. 9). Although He was God, He spoke to her as a man, not just as God.</p>
<p>Although He spoke to her as a man, His expression was more than that of just a man. If His expression had been merely that of a man, He would have said, &ldquo;Bring the waterpot to Me; I will talk to you after I get a drink.&rdquo; Such a word would have expressed only man. This would have been an expression of man as man. In contrast, the Lord expressed God even though He was also a man. In His asking for water and in His speaking to the Samaritan woman about water, God fully came forth from Him as a man.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Lord, some saints, who desire to express Christ, cannot properly conduct themselves even as human beings. Twenty years ago in Beijing I met a sister who was very zealous for the Lord. She would go throughout the city visiting people all day long, but she also began to neglect her home responsibilities and even her husband and children. Later, she began to tell people that she regretted getting married and having a family. When I was able to talk to her, she said that she believed the Lord did not want her to be a wife, because a wife has too much &ldquo;bondage,&rdquo; including the &ldquo;big bondage&rdquo; of a husband and the &ldquo;little bondage&rdquo; of children. She also said that she would never have married if she had believed in the Lord at an earlier age. After listening to her, I had a deep feeling that she had no experience of incarnation, even though she was zealous and loved the Lord. This sister needed to see a vision of incarnation and be a proper wife.</p>
<p>In 1936 I was serving the Lord in Tientsin. One day someone knocked on the door with such haste that I quickly ran to open it. When I opened the door, I saw a stranger with a handbag and who appeared to have come to town from the countryside. As soon as he saw me, he asked, &ldquo;Are you Mr. Lee?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and he immediately said, &ldquo;The Lord has sent me to you. I left everything behind for the Lord. I want to follow Him and glorify Him on earth.&rdquo; I then asked, &ldquo;Brother, do you have a family?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I have left my parents, wife, and children. The Lord Jesus charged me to do this in the Gospels, so I left them behind.&rdquo; When I asked him what he planned to do, he said, &ldquo;I do not know what to do. I am just following the leading of the Holy Spirit. God led me to you today, so I am here. If God leads me somewhere else tomorrow, I will go somewhere else.&rdquo; When I asked him if he no longer cared for his parents, wife, and children, he frowned and said, &ldquo;You are a fleshly person. The Lord wants us to leave everything behind to follow Him. You should know this.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;If you want to follow the Lord, how will you follow Him and where will you follow Him?&rdquo; He became quite angered by my questions and said, &ldquo;You are a fleshly person. Never mind. I will not stay with you.&rdquo; Then he left in a hurry.</p>
<p>This incident gave me a heavy feeling, so I considered it and also read the Bible. In the Gospel of Luke and other Gospels, the Lord indeed tells us to forsake and leave everything behind to follow Him (Luke 14:33; Matt. 19:29; Mark 10:29). Consequently, I asked the Lord, &ldquo;Do You really want us to leave everything behind as this man has done? There should be a purpose for leaving everything behind, but I feel that this brother left everything behind in an aimless way and without any purpose.&rdquo; Then the Spirit showed me something concerning our human responsibilities. On the one hand, the Gospels tell us to leave our wife, our children, our house, and our fields behind, but on the other hand, God charges us in the Epistles to love our wife, to be subject to our husband, to honor our mother and father, and to care for our children (Eph. 5:25, 22; 6:2-4; 1 Tim. 3:4). Such charges are related to the principle of incarnation. God does not enter into us to make us someone other than a man in the flesh; God enters into us so that we would express more than just the life of a man. He wants us to be proper as children, as husbands and wives, and as parents according to the principle of incarnation. God has no intention that we would no longer be men but that we would be men who express God.</p>
<p>A saint who works as a household servant may believe that menial work such as sweeping the floor is beneath him because he has the Lord Jesus in him, but he has an altogether mistaken concept. Our Lord was glorious and dignified, but when He became flesh and put on the human nature, He was lowlier than any of us. He was born into a poor family, and He grew up in an obscure little town. As a carpenter, He toiled daily in work, but he expressed God in this lowly life. This is incarnation. Therefore, if we have a job of sweeping and mopping the floor, our sweeping and mopping should express God now that we have believed in the Lord Jesus. May we express the Lord Jesus in our sweeping and mopping of the floor.</p>
<p>The tabernacle of God, which was among the children of Israel, illustrates this principle. The outer layer of the tabernacle was coarse porpoise skins (Exo. 26:14); it had no attracting form nor majesty. However, the inner layer of the tabernacle was embroidered with glorious and exquisite cherubim (v. 31). Inwardly we have the exceedingly glorious Word, but outwardly we are but base, earthen vessels (2 Cor. 4:7). The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Each one, in the calling in which he was called, in this let him remain&rdquo; (1 Cor. 7:20). We do not need to change our living; rather, we should express Christ in our living as a man. This is what is mysterious and powerful about Christians.</p>
<p>It is also possible for some saints who want to express Christ, to conduct themselves as human beings but without any true expression of Christ. Twenty years ago a Christian couple in Shanghai invited several co-workers to dinner. Upon seeing the happy and harmonious situation in their home, everyone admired the brother for having such a wife and the sister for having such a husband. On the surface, the brother was a good husband and the sister was a good wife, but the only expression that we could sense was the expression of a good brother being a good husband and a good sister being a good wife.</p>
<p>Christians can be good husbands but not express Christ, and Christians can be good wives but not express Christ. Even among worldly people, there are expressions of husbands being a good husband and expressions of wives being a good wife. With Christians, however, the expression of a husband or a wife should cause people to meet, feel, taste, and smell Christ. Being a good husband or a good wife apart from the expression of God is merely to express the flesh, not the Word. A normal Christian expresses the operation of divinity and humanity, humanity and divinity. Just being a good husband or a good wife is not enough. We must express Christ in our being a husband or a wife.</p>
<p>May the Holy Spirit speak to us so that we truly know how the meaning of <em>the Word became flesh</em> can be applied to our practical living. It is a glorious matter that the Word became flesh. The Word is our glorious Lord, and human beings are the flesh. He became one of us and is in us so that God may be expressed in man on the earth. This is a glorious matter.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">TABERNACLED</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14; Rev. 21:3</h1>
<p>John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Revelation 21:3 says, &ldquo;The tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them.&rdquo; The Chinese Union Version translates the Greek word for <em>tabernacle</em> as &ldquo;dwell&rdquo;. In fact, however, these two verses use the noun <em>tabernacle</em> as a verb. John used this word to convey a particular meaning, not because he was forced to for lack of a better word. The particular meaning of this word may not be evident from John 1:14, but it is clear in Revelation 21:3. God will not only dwell with men, but God will tabernacle with them. This shows that the matter of God&rsquo;s dwelling with men does not involve a common dwelling; it involves a tabernacle that is erected for the purpose of dwelling.</p>
<p>God wants to dwell with men, but His dwelling should not be considered a common thing. He wants to dwell within men by erecting a tabernacle among them. Such a building involves grouping, coordinating, and building up people. It is not easy to understand the Gospel of John without seeing this matter of tabernacling.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN<br />
BEING GOD&rsquo;S GREAT DELIGHT</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s great delight is to enter into man, to be mingled with man, and to be joined with man. We often speak of wanting to love and please God. However, as the Lord shines upon us, He gradually brings us to the point of knowing that He is touched the most when we let Him mingle Himself with us. If we really love Him, we will see that no other matter pleases His heart more than to let Him mingle Himself with us. This is not a matter of doctrine but of our practical living. If our living on this earth comes out of our being mingled with God, He will be pleased to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Many people are able to do things for the Lord, such as paying a price to follow Him, enduring, and laboring in many works, but such things do not necessarily touch His heart. Without the mingling of God and man in these things, our works, regardless of how good they seem to be, will not be of much value in His eyes, because they will be done outside of Him. Every valuable work has the element of the mingling of God and man in it. Being mingled with man is the most pleasing thing to God. This is the Word becoming flesh (John 1:14).</p>
<p>The meaning of the Word becoming flesh is nothing less than God being mingled with man and being expressed through the flesh. God does not want to be expressed simply in His divinity; God wants to be mingled with humanity and expressed through humanity, through our flesh, such that His life and nature are expressed through our humanity. This is what God delights in the most.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN BEING<br />
FOR GOD TO GAIN A DWELLING PLACE</h2>
<p>God came to be mingled with man not only because He takes delight in this, but also because He wants a home in which to dwell, a resting place among us, with us, and in us. This involves not only entering into man to be joined and mingled with man but also building those who have been mingled with Him into His dwelling place.</p>
<p>I have spoken of the mingling of God and man over the years, and I have said repeatedly that the mingling of God and man is for building a dwelling place of God in man. I am concerned, however, that many of us do not see this vision, because we so easily deviate from this and pay attention to things other than God. I am not concerned that our deviation is related to bad things, such as sin or the world. Rather, if we are not inwardly absolute and single toward God, even good things, such as the gospel and the edification of the saints, can be deviations. If we are not absolute, we may hear this word and know the doctrine, but we may not truly see that more than anything else God wants to gain man, to mingle Himself with man, and to build man into His dwelling place. It is not easy to see such a vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN BEING<br />
FOR MAN TO TAKE GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Almost no one preaches the truth of the mingling of God and man or the truth of the building of God. There are many orthodox Christians who endeavor to preach the gospel and to bring people to salvation, and it is common for Christians to exhort others to love the Lord, to consecrate themselves, to live for the Lord, to do God&rsquo;s will, and to work for the Lord. Consequently, there are many who pursue spirituality and endeavor to live a holy life. However, among God&rsquo;s children, we seldom hear a message on God&rsquo;s desire to mingle Himself with man. Although people can speak in generalities about receiving God&rsquo;s life when they believed in the Lord and of needing to live by God&rsquo;s life, their living may not reflect the intrinsic reality that God is life in order to mingle Himself with us. The Gospel of John is a book on God as life, and it repeatedly shows that God wants man to receive Him as life, just as we receive food and water. Whatever we eat and drink becomes a part of our constitution. Similarly, God wants to be our inner constitution.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s being mingled with us does not mean that God&rsquo;s person becomes our person, nor does it mean that we become God in order to be worshipped. That is not the meaning of mingling at all. Mingling means that God&rsquo;s life and nature have been imparted into us to be our element, and although we are human beings, we can live by God&rsquo;s life in us instead of by our human life. Although we are human beings, our human nature has been mingled with God&rsquo;s nature. Hence, we can learn to express God&rsquo;s life and nature through our life and nature.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS LIVING BY GOD<br />
AND LIVING OUT GOD</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John not only shows that God wants to be our life but also presents the Lord Jesus as the pattern of One who took God as His life. John&rsquo;s description of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; living on the earth shows a genuine man who lived by God&rsquo;s life, not by His human life. Chapters 3 through 6 and chapters 18 through 19, which present the Lord&rsquo;s betrayal and crucifixion, all show a man who took God as His life.</p>
<p>In the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, there is no mention of the Lord Jesus being hungry or thirsty, much less weeping, in ordinary circumstances. The only exception is when the Lord was tempted by the devil in Matthew 4:2, but this was not a normal situation. Only the Gospel of John shows the Lord Jesus being hungry, thirsty, and weeping in His normal human living (4:7; 11:35). This shows that He was a man, who, like us all, could be hungry, thirsty, and tired from journeying (4:6) and who could sympathize with man. When men wept, He wept. The situations described in the Gospel of John indicate that He genuinely was a man.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John also shows that the Lord Jesus did not live by His own human life. He said, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works&rdquo; (14:10). Even though He was a man living on the earth, He lived entirely by God, who was in Him as life. He was a man who could hunger and thirst, but He was a man who lived by God and who lived out God in His situations of hunger and thirst.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT WORKING FOR GOD BUT LETTING GOD WORK</h2>
<p>As soon as a Christian begins to love the Lord, he has the thought that he needs to do something for the Lord. There is hardly a person who, when he begins to love the Lord, has an inward realization that the Lord has no desire for him to do anything but to put aside his own life so that the life of God can be lived out through him. Very few have this thought when they first begin to love the Lord.</p>
<p>A young brother once came to see me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I would like to serve the Lord my whole life and work for Him. Originally, I wanted to study at a seminary, but I am afraid that a seminary may not be spiritual enough. I have heard that you have a training, and I would like very much to come. Would you grant me an opportunity to attend your training?&rdquo; As I talked to him, I learned that he had not been saved for long. He was very young in every respect, even though he was quite zealous for the Lord. I said to him, &ldquo;Brother, do not be anxious. Nothing is more important than giving the Lord the opportunity to live in you and to be expressed through you, not even studying in a seminary, attending the training, preaching the gospel, or reading the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God delights the most in our giving Him the opportunity to be in us as our life, not in how much we have pursued Him, how much we have worked for Him, or how much of a price we have paid for Him. This lesson cannot be learned in a seminary or a training but only in our daily living. Although we go to work, go to meetings, and worship God with the brothers and sisters, these can all be outward things. The most important thing is to stop ourselves because we love the Lord and to take Him as our life, letting Him live in us. Then when we work for God, our work will touch God&rsquo;s heart and be acceptable to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE WORD BECOMING FLESH<br />
BEING A TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>This mingling of God and man is the Word becoming flesh. The Word, who is the explanation of God, became flesh and was mingled with man as one. In and through the life and nature of man, the Word spoke forth God, explaining and declaring God through His expression. He was not an angel or a spirit but a man who spoke God forth. People say that He was a man because He was a man who fully lived a human life, yet in His human living God was expressed. He was a man living out God. This is the Word becoming flesh. This is the mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>When God is mingled with man through the Word becoming flesh, there is an issue of building. Once the Word became flesh, a tabernacle was erected. Our experience testifies that whenever we live by God as our life practically, we have a distinct sense of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This sense is related to both God being mingled with us and to us being God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>John says that God&rsquo;s dwelling is the tabernacle. As soon as the tabernacle is mentioned, we must consider the matter of being built up in coordination. The tabernacle was not built with one piece of wood, one piece of linen cloth, or one measure of gold, silver, and bronze. The tabernacle was produced with many boards and much linen cloth, gold, silver, and bronze. When we truly deny ourselves and live by God as our life, we not only sense God&rsquo;s presence, but we also sense that we cannot live individually before God. When we live by ourselves, we often feel self-sufficient, but when we live by God, we feel the need to be coordinated with the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>This is certainly the case with our church service and the move of the work, but even our family affairs touch this principle. When we handle our family affairs by ourselves, we often have the feeling that our wisdom, skill, ways, and insight are quite good, and we have no sense of any need to fellowship or seek help from the brothers and sisters. But whenever we stop ourselves and live by God as our life, we immediately feel that we must fellowship with the brothers and sisters. This is the issue of the Word becoming flesh. If a brother sees the vision of the mingling of God and man and allows God to come into him as life practically, he will be built up quickly and see the vision of the church, the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The matter of the church, the Body of Christ, is not merely one of light or truth; to merely preach and teach this truth is futile. We need to receive mercy and be led to understand God&rsquo;s desire, which is to gain a way to mingle Himself with man and be man&rsquo;s life. Whoever sees this and cares for God&rsquo;s heart will let God into him to be his life. Such a one will discover that he needs the other members, the Body, the church. He needs a group of brothers and sisters who, like him, live in God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Many Christians today can talk about serving God and about being spiritual. However, there is no sense of their being in coordination with others or even of receiving a supply from other members. A person who is being mingled with God and built up with others, however, can be supplied by those with whom he is not like-minded in a natural way. It is even possible for him to be coordinated with these ones. Such a mutual supply and coordination are not related to having the same doctrine but to being connected to the same inner life. This is the building of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF JOHN BEING<br />
ON LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John shows that the first step in God coming to be man&rsquo;s life involves His being mingled with man; the last step involves the building of a dwelling place for God. John wrote not only the Gospel of John but also Revelation. His Gospel is the beginning of his writing, and Revelation is the completion of his writing. In the beginning of his Gospel, John spoke of life and of the Lord coming so that man would have life (John 1:4; 10:10), but he did not speak clearly of the reason that the Lord wanted man to have life. The last section of Revelation, however, shows that the issue of life is a built-up city (21:2). John&rsquo;s speaking shows that God came to be man&rsquo;s life for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>Not long after I was saved, I realized that John speaks particularly of life. However, as I have mused upon God&rsquo;s Word and touched God&rsquo;s Word in recent years, I have seen much more clearly that life is for God&rsquo;s building. John speaks not only of life but also of building. John&rsquo;s ministry is a ministry of life and building. Formerly, I could only say that God entered into man so that we could live a holy life, live a life of faith in God, and even live a life that lives out God, but now I can tell people with assurance that God enters into us as life for the sake of His building. The Word became flesh in order to tabernacle. When the Word became flesh, God entered into man as life. The issue of the Word becoming flesh, however, is tabernacling. John uses the word <em>tabernacled</em> to indicate that God came to be man&rsquo;s life for the purpose of building.</p>
<p>In our human life we all feel that we are capable and able to stand on our own. Even the most foolish person often has no sense of his need for others; rather, he is under the impression that he can do everything in an independent and individualistic way. However, when we see a vision concerning God entering into us to be our life, we will stop ourselves and begin to live by Him as our life practically, and we will have an immediate sense that our independence and individualism are not matters to be praised. The more we are in ourselves, the more we feel that our individualism is justified, but the less we are in ourselves, the more we turn away from our individualism. If we live according to ourselves, even exhortations to be humble, to receive help, and to fellowship with others will be of no value, because there will be an element of pride in our accomplished humility, and our inward independence and self-justification will remain.</p>
<p>I know about these conditions because prolonged illnesses often make one a good doctor. I also know how to treat this illness. The more we live by ourselves, the more we will despise others, distrust others, disrespect others, and have no need of others. However, the more we live in God, the more we will need the brothers and sisters, and the more we will see that every brother and sister is capable of rendering help to us. This is the principle of coordination, the principle of building. This is the Word becoming flesh and tabernacling among us. Wherever the Word becomes flesh, God is mingled with man, and wherever God becomes man&rsquo;s life, the tabernacling, the building, is manifested.</p>
<p>John spoke not only of life but also of building. John tells us that God came to be man&rsquo;s life for the purpose of building. The Word becoming flesh was not only so that God could enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life but in order to erect a tabernacle, to build a dwelling place, among men. At the end of all his speaking, John says, &ldquo;Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men&rdquo; (Rev. 21:3). In Revelation the tabernacle is a city built of many precious stones with the twelve names of the twelve apostles inscribed on its foundation and the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel inscribed on its gates (vv. 12, 14). This means that the city is built through God&rsquo;s life with the redeemed from both the Old Testament and the New Testament.</p>
<p>The Lord passed through death and resurrection to produce a building. In John 2 the Lord did two significant things. First, He changed water into wine in Cana (vv. 1-11), and second, He cleansed the temple (vv. 12-17). John did not write of these two things in a random way; instead, his arrangement shows great significance. The order of these events, which are connected with the words <em>third day</em> and <em>three days</em> (vv. 1, 19), is significant. The Lord Jesus came to Cana on the third day (v. 1), and after the Lord cleansed the temple, the Jews asked, &ldquo;What sign do You show us, seeing that You do these things?&rdquo; Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (vv. 18-19). The water was changed into wine on the third day, and the Lord said that He would raise up the temple in three days. Both events involve three days, which always implies resurrection. In His resurrection the Lord changed the water of death into the wine of life for the sake of the building, which also was raised up in three days. The temple that the Lord raised up is the temple of His body (v. 21), which is also the tabernacling Word in 1:14. The tabernacle in 1:14 is the temple in 2:21. The temple of His body was killed on the cross, but the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;In three days I will raise it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Lord resurrected from death, His body in the flesh was enlarged into a mystical Body, which includes not only Himself but also all those whom He regenerated and saved. Resurrection enlarged the temple of His body. Originally, His body, which was the temple of God, was a single grain of wheat; but when His body was killed on the cross, this grain of wheat was resurrected in three days as many grains (12:24). What was built up in resurrection was not only the body of Jesus of Nazareth but also the mystical Body of Christ, consisting of myriads of people regenerated through His resurrection. With our considerations of space and time, it does not seem as if the Body of Christ was built, but God has no considerations of space and time. In God&rsquo;s eyes a universal dwelling place was built when the Lord resurrected from the dead. In our experience the Lord Jesus is still building His mystical Body in resurrection today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>I long that more and more of God&rsquo;s children would have a vision to see the matter that touches God&rsquo;s heart the most, which is to let Him enter into us, to be mingled with us, and to be our life. What matters is not our work for Him, our zealousness for Him, our help to the poor, or our preaching of the gospel. There is only one matter that can satisfy God&rsquo;s desire, which is to be mingled with God so that He can be our life and living. By His mercy, we can stop ourselves and let Him be our life even in such practical things as our getting dressed, our eating a meal, and our work and family situations. Nothing touches God&rsquo;s heart more than this. He delights in the Word becoming flesh so that He can mingle with us and be our life in our daily living.</p>
<p>When we experience being mingled with God, we will have a strong sense that we cannot be individualistic but, instead, that we need to coordinate with the brothers and sisters to be built together. Then our condition will express God as our life for the sake of His building. God will not only be expressed in us, but He also will gain a restful dwelling place among us. This is what He wants to work out, and this is what He will obtain. Life and building solve all the problems of the church. Outward debates, explanations, and teachings cannot solve the problems faced by the church. The practical solution to the problems of the church is life and building.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">GRACE AND REALITY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 17-18; 14:20-23; 1 John 1:5-7; 4:16; 2:23-24</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning grace and reality in the Gospel of John. Verse 14 in chapter 1 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; This verse shows that there is grace and reality because the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. When the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, He was full of grace and reality.</p>
<p>When the Word became flesh, God was mingled with man so that God could live in man and express Himself through man&rsquo;s human life and nature. In the flesh of the Lord Jesus, God became man&rsquo;s inward life and outward living. He became the inward content and outward expression of a man of flesh. He became flesh in order to raise up a tabernacle for Himself as His dwelling place among men. The Word became flesh so that God could be mingled with man and become everything to man. The Word tabernacled among men so that a dwelling place for God could be built. Both His mingling and His building depend upon grace and reality. If we want to receive grace and touch reality, we must be mingled with the explained God so that God becomes our inward life and outward living. Not only so, we must allow Him to do His work of tabernacling, His work of building, in us. If we take this way, we will experience Him as the One who is full of grace and reality. In order to receive grace and touch reality, we must allow God to do this work in us and on us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S SHALLOW CONCEPT CONCERNING GRACE</h2>
<p><em>Grace</em> is a very common term among Christians today. Many people thank the Lord for grace and praise Him for grace. Similarly, the term <em>reality</em> is also rather common. Every Christian wants to receive grace and touch reality. However, these terms in the Bible are special; they are not ordinary concepts based on our natural understanding. When most Christians consider the matter of grace, they think of something freely given and freely received. For example, out of love someone may buy us a very expensive watch as a gift. Since we have not paid for it, we regard this as grace. We cannot say that this is a wrong concept; however, it is ordinary. Many speak of grace in regard to a wide range of material things. For example, a person who has a stomachache may pray for relief, and when his pain stops, he speaks of receiving grace. Similarly, a person who is unemployed may pray for a job, and when the Lord arranges a job with good pay for him, he speaks of receiving grace. Another person who does not have a place to live may pray for a house, and when he finds an affordable and good house, he speaks of receiving grace. Sometimes, we even thank God for His grace when we were able to catch a bus.</p>
<p>Other people speak of grace in regard to spiritual matters, speaking of grace in relation to the forgiveness of our sins, which is based on the death of Christ on the cross rather than the works of law (Gal. 2:16). I cannot say that this is wrong. However, according to the context of John 1:14, grace does not refer to healing, good jobs, or affordable housing. Strictly speaking, it does not even refer to the redemptive grace by which we are justified freely before God. We surely believe that the Lord Jesus shed His blood on our behalf and that we are justified freely because of His redemption, but this is not the grace that is spoken of in verse 14.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BOTH GRACE AND REALITY BEING GOD HIMSELF</h2>
<p>Verses 17 and 18 say, &ldquo;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; These verses tell us that grace and reality are nothing less than God Himself. Verse 17 speaks of the law and of grace and reality in a way of contrast. The law was given through Moses, whereas grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. Thus, the law is in contrast to grace and reality. According to verse 17, &ldquo;grace and reality came through Jesus Christ,&rdquo; and according to verse 18, &ldquo;no one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; The sequence in verses 17 and 18 shows that God in verse 18 is related to the grace and reality that came through Jesus Christ in verse 17. Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ, and only Jesus Christ declared God; hence, the declared God is the grace and reality that came through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; To have grace is to have God, and to have reality is also to have God. However, verse 14 does not say &ldquo;full of God&rdquo; but &ldquo;full of grace and reality,&rdquo; because God is not simple. He is grace as well as reality.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD BEING ALSO LIGHT AND LOVE</h2>
<p>First John does not mention grace or emphasize reality; it stresses that God is light and love (1:5; 4:16). In the Gospel of John, God is grace and reality; in 1 John, God is love and light. John wrote both books. In the Gospel, John says that God came forth, that God became flesh and brought grace and reality to us. In his first Epistle, John says that we have received and obtained God as eternal life and that we touch God as love and light in our fellowship with God. When God comes to us, He is grace and reality; when we touch God, He is love and light.</p>
<p>Love and grace are two aspects of the same thing. Love is the source of grace, and grace is the flowing out of love. Love is hidden in God&rsquo;s heart, and grace is the flowing out, the expression, of God&rsquo;s love. God is love, and God in His coming forth is grace. God comes forth from unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16) and brings Himself to us so that we may receive Him as grace. After we receive Him and enjoy Him, we realize that He is love. God is grace to us because He is love. Since God is love, He gives Himself freely to us; this is grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OBTAINING GRACE BY OBTAINING GOD</h2>
<p>Grace is God obtained by us. We obtain grace only when we obtain God Himself. We should regard the things that God has given to us on earth as provisions of His care, but not as the grace that is spoken of in John 1. In the Old Testament, Solomon said, &ldquo;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&rdquo; (Eccl. 1:2), and in the New Testament, Paul says that he counted all things as refuse (Phil. 3:8). Solomon was a wise man who said that all is vanity; Paul was a man with revelation who said that he counted all things as refuse. God would be cheating us if grace were something that Solomon in his wisdom considered to be vanity or something that Paul in his revelation considered to be refuse. God will never give things to us as grace.</p>
<p>It is pitiful that Christians pay attention to the vain things on earth. When we give thanks to God, it is often merely because we have obtained some temporary earthly benefits. If Solomon heard our words of thanksgiving, he would laugh because what we consider as grace, he considered to be vanity of vanities. Paul would be puzzled because what we consider as grace, he considered to be refuse. Solomon said that such things are vanity of vanities, but we say that they are grace, and Paul said that such things are refuse, but we say that they are grace. This is pitiful.</p>
<p>A couple who have been married for many years may not have any children, but if, after believing in the Lord, a son is born to them, they will feel that his birth is a matter of grace, surpassing what they could ask or think. Consequently, they will constantly testify, &ldquo;Jesus, in whom we have believed, is the true God. When we worshipped idols, we had no children, but when we believed in the Lord, our son was born. Our Lord is truly effective and full of grace.&rdquo; This may sound like a joke, but this is the concept of many Christians today.</p>
<p>I once met a couple who studied abroad. They heard the gospel but rejected it. One day their beloved child fell off a bridge and drowned. They were greatly grieved and saddened, and they could not stay in their home with all their memories. Consequently, they moved to northern China. Eventually, they were touched by the testimony of a brother in the church there and believed in the Lord. Though their child was lost, they obtained God; this truly is grace. God has given Himself to us, and when we obtain God, we obtain grace. Only God is the hope in the universe, and only God is the treasure of peerless worth. We obtain grace only when we obtain God.</p>
<p>When we fellowship with God and draw near to Him, the sweeter, more intimate, and deeper is our sense of grace. When we obtain God as grace, we also have an indescribable sense of God&rsquo;s love. When God comes forth to be received by us, He is grace; and when we fellowship with God and enjoy Him, we sense that He is love. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God also abides in him (1 John 4:16). This love is God Himself. How sweet and how glorious this is!</p>
<p>The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace. This refers to God Himself being obtained by us. When we obtain grace and we fellowship and draw near to Him by this grace, we enjoy love. We are in God and we are also in love, because God is love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TOUCHING REALITY BY TOUCHING GOD</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus, God incarnate, is also full of reality. The word <em>reality</em> can also be translated as &ldquo;truth&rdquo; or &ldquo;genuineness.&rdquo; In the universe only God is genuine; everything else is fake. Furthermore, only God is real; everything else is vanity. A parent may love his child very much and may treat his child as a treasure. However, if his child dies, his treasure will be gone and no longer real. If a child grows up without any incident but devotes all his heart and time to his career and family, this will also be a situation of vanity. This is the case with matters involving living persons, and it is even more the case with lifeless, material things. Heaven and earth will pass away, not to mention the few possessions that we may have. In the universe only God is eternal, and hence, only God is real. When we obtain God, we obtain grace, and when we touch God, we touch reality, genuineness. In other words, when we obtain God, we obtain grace; when we touch God, we touch reality.</p>
<p>On one end, grace is the flowing out of love, and on the other end, love is the source of grace. When God comes forth to be obtained by us, He is grace, and when we touch God to enjoy Him, we experience Him as love. Reality and light are in the same principle. When God comes forth for us to touch, He is truth, reality. When we fellowship with God and touch God in reality, we experience Him as light. Light expressed is reality. When we touch reality, we touch something genuine and real. Then when we fellowship with God and touch God in reality, we feel that we are in the light. When we obtain grace and enjoy God, we experience love; when we contact God as reality, we touch light. When God comes to us, we obtain Him as grace and touch Him as reality. As grace and in reality, we enjoy God as love and touch Him as light. &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; This verse shows that through the Word, we can receive God as grace and touch God as reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTRAST BETWEEN MOSES AND JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>There is a contrast in John 1:17, which says, &ldquo;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The letter, which is empty of life, was given through Moses; however, grace and reality, which are God Himself, came through Jesus Christ, through the Word who became flesh and tabernacled among us. Moses brought the law, whereas Jesus Christ brought God to us. We receive the letter of the law from Moses, but we receive God as grace and reality through Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEQUENCE OF GRACE AND REALITY<br />
AND OF LIGHT AND LOVE</h2>
<p>Grace comes before reality in the Gospel of John because John speaks of God coming to be obtained by us. Without grace, we have no reality. Hence, first there is grace, and then there is reality. We must first receive Him before we can touch Him. In 1 John, however, light comes before love. When we return to God, we have light and then love. When He comes to us, He is grace and reality, but when we fellowship with Him, we have light and then love. As soon as we are in His presence, we touch light. In our fellowship there is no shadow or barrier; everything is completely transparent. In this condition we enjoy Him as love, and He becomes our sweet and full enjoyment.</p>
<p>The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us so that we may enjoy God fully, obtaining Him as grace and touching Him as reality. Then we touch God as light and enjoy Him as love. This is the Word becoming flesh and tabernacling among us practically. When we obtain God and enjoy God, we are filled with God Himself.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEHOLDING HIS GLORY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 18, 49-51; 2:11; 11:40; 17:1, 4-5; Heb. 1:3; Exo. 40:34-35</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters we looked at three matters in John 1:14: the Word becoming flesh, tabernacling, and being full of grace and reality. In this chapter we will consider the matter of beholding His glory. Although these are seemingly different subjects, they are fully related to one another. The Word becoming flesh is God&rsquo;s tabernacling among us. God&rsquo;s tabernacling among us is full of grace and reality, and in this grace and reality His glory is manifested. These four matters are all related to one another. In this chapter we will consider the matter of beholding His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GLORY BEING GOD EXPRESSED</h2>
<p>Although many brothers and sisters are familiar with the term <em>glory,</em> they may not necessarily know the meaning of glory. I must admit that this matter is difficult to explain, because our experience of glory is very limited. Even when the Old Testament speaks of the glory of Jehovah filling the tabernacle (Exo. 40:34-35), it does not provide a clear explanation or description of glory. The verses speak of a cloud covering the Tent of Meeting and the glory of Jehovah filling the tabernacle. There is a connection between the cloud and God&rsquo;s glory, but the cloud is not the glory. Hence, it is not easy to explain the matter of glory.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters think that glory is God manifesting Himself radiantly before men. Many Bible versions that have cross references link <em>beheld His glory</em> in John 1:14 to the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on the mountain. According to the writers of these cross references, when Peter, James, and John saw the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on Mount Hermon, they were beholding the Lord&rsquo;s glory (Matt. 17:1-2). We cannot say that the phrase in John 1:14 is not related to this incident, but glory refers to more than the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration. The entire Gospel of John is needed in order to explain this phrase. The glory spoken of by John refers to God being expressed. Although God cannot be seen or touched, it is possible for people to speak of God being expressed.</p>
<p>The introduction to the Gospel of John is contained in verses 1 through 18 of chapter 1, and in this introduction John says, &ldquo;We beheld His glory&rdquo; (v. 14). John beheld the God who was spoken forth, the Word who became flesh. In His becoming flesh, He tabernacled among men so that He could express God. As soon as the children of Israel left Egypt and raised up the tabernacle, the glory of God filled the tabernacle. God dwelt in the tabernacle, and His glory was expressed through the tabernacle. When the tabernacle was filled with God&rsquo;s glory, it was filled with God&rsquo;s expression. When John wrote his Gospel, he used the picture of the tabernacle to tell people that the Word, who was spoken forth and who became flesh, was also a tabernacle. As such a tabernacle, God was expressed and could be received by men as grace and reality. He could be received because He was expressed in glory. This glory cannot be seen outwardly, but it can be seen by our inner eyes of faith.</p>
<p>According to the Gospel of John, glory is a person; that is, glory is God in the flesh being expressed. Although Jesus looked like an ordinary man, people could not help but realize that God was among them. He was like the tabernacle in the Old Testament, which was outwardly covered with rough and ugly porpoise skins (Exo. 26:14) but was inwardly filled with the brightness of Jehovah, the glory of God. When Jesus the Nazarene was on the earth, His outward appearance was comparable to the covering of porpoise skins on the tabernacle. He did not have any attracting form nor majesty, and His visage was marred more than that of any man (Isa. 53:2; 52:14). However, those who contacted Him could not help but realize that in Him there was an expression of God as glory (John 1:41, 49). When the Lord Jesus was transfigured on the mountain, the disciples saw His glory with both their inner spiritual eyes and their physical eyes. However, when John spoke of beholding His glory, his emphasis was on the glory that the disciples saw as the Lord tabernacled among them in a lowly man for more than three years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPRESSING THE GLORY OF GOD</h2>
<p>The beginning word in John 1 is an introduction, a prelude. Every case that follows this introduction confirms that people beheld His glory. At the end of chapter 1, when Nathanael came to the Lord Jesus, the Lord spoke of the condition of Nathanael&rsquo;s heart, saying, &ldquo;Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile!&rdquo; (v. 47). He also said, &ldquo;Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you&rdquo; (v. 48). Nathanael was greatly surprised by the Lord&rsquo;s word, and he responded, saying, &ldquo;You are the Son of God&rdquo; (v. 49). In this lowly person, Nathanael saw something that could not be found in ordinary people, so he could not help but say that Jesus was the Son of God. Nathanael beheld the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p>In chapter 2 the Lord Jesus changed water into wine at a wedding feast in Cana of Galilee (vv. 1-11). In this situation people witnessed the glory of God being expressed and coming forth in a lowly man. Consequently, verse 11 speaks of the miracle as the &ldquo;beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee,&rdquo; which &ldquo;manifested His glory.&rdquo; The God who was hidden in Jesus was expressed, and this expression was glory.</p>
<p>In chapter 4 we also see a manifestation of glory. As a lowly man, the Lord Jesus was weary from His journey; He was hungry and thirsty. After His disciples left to buy food, a woman came to the well where the Lord was resting. In this situation His outward appearance surely could be likened to the porpoise skins on the tabernacle. When the woman came, He said, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). Through this word, the Lord manifested His glory. Even though the woman was puzzled, the Lord had stirred up a longing within her for this living water. Therefore, she said, &ldquo;Sir, give me this water&rdquo; (v. 15). The Lord said, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here&rdquo; (v. 16). The woman, thinking that the Lord had unintentionally touched the dark side of her living, tried to cover up her situation by telling the truth, so she said, &ldquo;I do not have a husband.&rdquo; The Lord immediately responded, saying, &ldquo;You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). With this word the Lord revealed that He knew her background. When she heard the Lord&rsquo;s words, she must have felt that there was something extraordinary about this tired and thirsty man with a marred visage. It is no wonder that she went into the city and testified to the people, saying, &ldquo;Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ?&rdquo; (v. 29). She saw a manifestation of glory.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 the Lord arrived in Jerusalem and came to the porticoes at Bethesda. There were many sick people lying there, but no one paid attention to the Lord Jesus, who had no attracting form. The Lord saw a person who was sick for thirty-eight years, and He asked, &ldquo;Do you want to get well?&rdquo; (v. 6). The man answered, &ldquo;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me&rdquo; (v. 7). The Lord then said, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk&rdquo; (v. 8). Immediately, the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked (v. 9). I believe that in this situation the glory of God was expressed through the Lord Jesus, a seemingly ordinary man.</p>
<p>In chapter 6 the Lord used five loaves and two fish to feed many people. The Lord was full of wisdom and authority when He preached to the crowd; hence, they did not want to depart. The other Gospels also record this case, saying that the disciples came to the Lord and said, &ldquo;Send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy for themselves something to eat&rdquo; (Mark 6:36). The Lord answered, &ldquo;You give them something to eat&rdquo; (v. 37). The disciples tried, but they could find only five loaves and two fish (cf. Luke 9:13). Then the Lord Jesus ordered the disciples to have the crowd recline by companies on the green grass. The Lord took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. Eventually, those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men (Mark 6:39-44). In the beginning the disciples might have said, &ldquo;How can we divide five loaves and two fish among so many people?&rdquo; but eventually everyone ate and was satisfied, and they gathered the leftover pieces and filled twelve handbaskets (John 6:13). That was truly a manifestation of the Lord&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>In John 8 the scribes and Pharisees brought to the Lord a woman who had been caught in adultery (v. 3). According to the law of Moses, she should be stoned to death. The scribes and Pharisees used this case to test the Lord Jesus. They asked Him, &ldquo;What then do You say?&rdquo; (v. 5). This was a very difficult question. If the Lord said she should be stoned to death, how could He say that He loved sinners and had come for the sake of sinners? If the Lord said that she should not die, then He would be accused of violating the law of Moses. At this moment, the One who had a marred visage stooped down to write on the ground. When they persisted in questioning Him, the Lord Jesus stood up and said, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&rdquo; (v. 7). The Lord&rsquo;s words not only had much authority, but they were also full of love! He did not say whether or not they should stone her. He only said that whoever was without sin could throw the first stone. After saying this, He again stooped down and wrote on the ground (v. 8). When the people heard what He said, they left one by one, beginning with the older ones. Eventually, Jesus was left alone and only the woman stood in the midst (v. 9). Then the Lord Jesus stood up and said to her, &ldquo;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&rdquo; (v. 10). She said, &ldquo;No one, Lord,&rdquo; and Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you&rdquo; (v. 11). What glory was expressed with this word! His sweet love is indescribable. This situation illustrates John&rsquo;s word in 1:18: &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In chapter 9, when the Lord Jesus saw a man blind from birth, His disciples asked, &ldquo;Who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?&rdquo; (v. 2). The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but he was born so, that the works of God might be manifested in him&rdquo; (v. 3). The expression <em>that the works of God might be manifested</em> refers to the manifestation of God&rsquo;s glory. The Lord intended to manifest a situation of glory on this blind man.</p>
<p>In chapter 11 a man named Lazarus was sick and then died. His sisters asked the Lord Jesus to come and visit him in order to heal him, but the Lord did not come immediately. He waited until Lazarus was dead and buried (v. 17). According to our natural understanding, this was a hopeless situation. When the Lord Jesus arrived, they took Him to the dead man&rsquo;s tomb (v. 38). Then the Lord commanded them to take away the stone that was covering the entrance to the tomb (v. 39). When He cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&rdquo; (v. 43), Lazarus came out. This situation was truly glorious!</p>
<p>Every case presented in the Gospel of John shows that people realized God was being expressed through Jesus the Nazarene. With Him there was glory, a glory that could not be found in anyone other than Him, just as a father can be truly expressed only by his son. This is the reason 1:14 speaks of His glory, the &ldquo;glory as of the only Begotten from the Father.&rdquo; The expression <em>from the Father</em> indicates that the glory He expressed can be likened to a son expressing all that his father has given him. Only a son can obtain and express all that is of his father.</p>
<p>Hence, verse 18 continues, saying, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; The Son&rsquo;s declaring is glory. God is declared in the way of glory. In the universe only the Lord can declare God, and only He has glory. After seeing all these cases, we should have a better understanding of what it means to behold His glory.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPRESSING GOD&rsquo;S GLORY</h2>
<p>The incarnation of the Lord as the Word speaks of the only begotten Son of the Father becoming flesh. However, the incarnation of the Lord has also been enlarged to include you and me and all who have believed in Him. Everyone who believes in Him has the reality of the incarnation and is a part of this tabernacle. The principle of incarnation and tabernacling should be applied to us all.</p>
<p>The significance of the incarnation is the mingling of God with man and the living out of God in man. As a result of this mingling, we become His habitation, a tabernacle, in which He may rest and make His home. Whenever and wherever a group of people live in the principle of incarnation and tabernacling, there will be glory. Such ones may look very ordinary, but among them and within them there will be the manifestation of glory. Being a Christian is not related to doing good deeds. Christians must cause others to touch a sense of glory in them, not just a sense of good.</p>
<p>Before I was saved, there was a fire at my place of work, and everyone was busy moving things away from the affected area. During this time I saw a small ink bottle made of fine china with a small Western brush that I liked very much, so I secretly took them home with me. After I was saved, the Spirit told me to deal with this unrighteous matter. Although I still had the ink bottle, I had lost the brush. Therefore, I decided to pay for its loss with money. I took the ink bottle and a dollar and went to see the owner. I confessed shamefully to him that I had taken the two items and that I was returning them willingly. After he listened to me, he insisted that it was not necessary for me to return them. After I pleaded with him repeatedly, he said, &ldquo;I will accept the ink bottle, but I cannot accept this dollar.&rdquo; Then he saw that I was holding a combined solar-lunar calendar, which were very popular calendars but not easy to obtain, and he said, &ldquo;I will accept your calendar as a substitute for the brush.&rdquo; Although I did not want to part with my calendar, I gave it to him because I was indebted to him. When I left, I still felt that I should not keep the dollar. So I prayed, &ldquo;Lord, please show me a beggar to whom I can give this dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I returned home, it was dark, but shortly after I shut the door, someone knocked on my door. I opened the door and saw a stranger who was asking for help because he had not eaten for the whole day. I immediately felt that he had been sent by God. I took him in, fed him, and gave him some steamed buns for his journey. Since he was unfamiliar with the surroundings, I helped him find a place where he could stay for the night. While we were on our way, I took out the dollar and put it in his hand. He was very surprised and said, &ldquo;I cannot take this.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Please do not refuse. You must take it.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Sir, you are very good. You are a really good man.&rdquo; I smiled and said, &ldquo;You are wrong. I am not good. I am a sinner. I am not good at all. Jesus is good. Jesus told me to feed you, and Jesus told me to give you the dollar.&rdquo; When we came to a crossroad, I pointed to a place where he could find accommodations. He thanked me and left. At that very moment, a brother called to me from across the street, saying, &ldquo;Brother Lee, where are you heading?&rdquo; Then he walked over to me and gave me a package. &ldquo;This is for you,&rdquo; he said. When I returned home, I opened the package, and incredibly, it was a combined solar-lunar calendar. The joy in me at that time was indescribable.</p>
<p>I had this experience when I was young. I was led by the Lord to confess and deal with my sins and to receive a stranger. This was not something that I would normally do; it was the Lord in me. This kind of behavior surpasses human goodness and morality. This is glory. As Christians who pursue the Lord, we should have daily experiences of incarnation so that people can see glory in us.</p>
<p>On the outskirts of Foochow, there were two flesh brothers who were also brothers in the Lord. They were farmers, and their land was on the hillside. Whenever there was a drought, they had to manually carry water up to their field to irrigate it. During one drought they carried water all day up to their field. The next day they discovered that their neighbor had dug a hole at the ridge of their field and had drained their water into his field which was located on a lower terrace. They did not want to say anything, so they plugged the hole and again watered their field. However, when they went to their field the next day, they found that the neighbor had again stolen their water. The brothers were very angry, but they did not want to have an argument with him because they had recently preached the gospel to him. They went to see a brother to ask him what to do, and this brother led them to pray and read from Matthew 5:39-42, which says, &ldquo;Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. And to him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also; and whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. To him who asks of you, give; and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.&rdquo; After reading the Scripture and praying, the two brothers irrigated their neighbor&rsquo;s field, and then they irrigated their own field. When the neighbor came to steal their water, he was surprised to see that his field was already irrigated. This occurred over a period of several days, and it greatly puzzled the neighbor. When he discovered that the two brothers were irrigating his field for him, he said in his heart, &ldquo;Even though I stole their water, they have not rebuked me; instead, they have irrigated my field. What kind of thing is this?&rdquo; The neighbor was greatly moved by their actions, and he apologized to the two brothers. Shortly thereafter he was saved.</p>
<p>This is an experience of incarnation. It is not being merely good or ethical. It is a mystery; it is the Lord Jesus living within people and living out from within them. I hope that these two simple testimonies will help you understand this principle. The One who was the Word in the beginning has been incarnated, and furthermore, He has come into us as life and has mingled Himself with us. He is now tabernacling in us. As we experience this mingling and His tabernacling, God will be manifested through us. We will have wisdom and discernment that others lack, and we will be able to endure sufferings that others cannot bear. In us there will be a situation that surpasses mere human goodness and virtue because God is being expressed through us. This is glory.</p>
<p>This is according to our experience. Before we were saved, we were full of pride and critical of others. Furthermore, we were estranged from others. Then we received the gospel, and we were regenerated. At that time there was no need for anyone to speak to us about our pride or to advise us to be reconciled with others. These responses were manifested in us because we met the Lord Jesus inwardly. In considering these responses, a husband may say, &ldquo;My wife has changed,&rdquo; and a neighbor may say, &ldquo;Oh, she is so different.&rdquo; Even parents may say, &ldquo;My daughter is a different person.&rdquo; The more we contact the Lord, the more we are changed, and the more people will speak of God&rsquo;s glory being in us. Although our response may be manifested seemingly as mere zeal, patience, or goodness, the source of these virtues is mysterious and marvelous.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PEOPLE RECEIVING GRACE AND TOUCHING REALITY WHEN THEY SEE GLORY</h2>
<p>When people see God&rsquo;s glory in us, they can receive God through us as grace. They can also meet God and touch God in us as the reality. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.&rdquo; The Lord is full of grace and reality because of glory. When people receive glory, they receive grace; when people touch glory, they touch reality. Glory, grace, and reality are related to the manifestation of God.</p>
<p>The living and the tabernacling of Christ that are seen in the Gospel of John are related to our Christian living. The Word became flesh, and as the tabernacle of God, He was filled with God&rsquo;s glory and He manifested God&rsquo;s glory. We have beheld His glory, and others can see this glory by receiving grace and touching reality through us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">RECEIVING OF HIS FULLNESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:16; Col. 2:9-11</h1>
<p>John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Being full of grace and reality refers to obtaining and enjoying the Lord Jesus, who is the fullness of God (v. 16). When we obtain grace and touch reality, God&rsquo;s glory is manifested through the Lord. This is the reason that John says, &ldquo;We beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father&rdquo; (v. 14).</p>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the phrase <em>of His fullness we have all received</em> in verse 16. According to the sentence structure in the Greek text, this phrase is connected to the phrase <em>full of grace and reality</em> in verse 14 because verse 15 is an inserted word. Hence, the fullness spoken of in verse 16 is actually the grace and reality mentioned in verse 14. Of His fullness, that is, of His grace and reality, we have all received.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULLNESS OF THE LORD BEING<br />
THE CONTENT OF GOD</h2>
<p>Although we say that fullness is equal to grace and reality, we may not be fully clear about the significance of this matter. John used a special term <em>fullness</em> to show that the fullness we have received from the Lord is just the content of God. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; The fullness of Christ is equal to the content of God.</p>
<p>Many Christians associate fullness and grace with material things on earth. For example, a person may testify, &ldquo;Formerly, I had a hard life because what I earned could not cover my rent. But God is blessing me now, and my financial situation has changed completely. I have a nice house for myself and two other houses to rent. Furthermore, I am building another house. I have truly received of His fullness, even grace upon grace.&rdquo; Many of us have heard such testimonies.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, I was living in Tsingtao. One day a brother came to see me. I asked him about his business, and he responded, &ldquo;Oh, I have received of the Lord&rsquo;s fullness with grace upon grace. Although business is somewhat slow, my inventory in Tsingtao and Shanghai is quite good, and I have a branch office in Tsinan. Furthermore, there is sufficient revenue. This is truly grace upon grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion I was invited to a brother&rsquo;s home for a meal. I had met this brother when his children were young. When I went to his house to eat, his children were adults. I asked about his children, and he said, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! We have all received of His fullness and grace upon grace. My oldest son has graduated from a university, and my younger son has graduated from another university. Not only so, they are both married.&rdquo; When his daughters-in-law came into the room, he introduced them to me, telling me from which college they had graduated. Then he called his grandchildren over and said, &ldquo;These are my grandchildren. See how gracious God has been to me these years. This is truly grace upon grace.&rdquo; After listening to him, I did not know whether to be upset because this brother was blind to the true meaning of grace or amused because the earthly fullness that this brother had was not the fullness spoken of by the apostle John. In Paul&rsquo;s eyes this brother&rsquo;s &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; was refuse (Phil. 3:8). It was not grace upon grace but refuse upon refuse. This is the pitiful situation of many Christians today.</p>
<p><em>Grace</em> in John 1:16 does not refer to material things, and <em>His fullness</em> does not refer to having a family with good children and grandchildren, a storehouse filled with goods, or a handful of houses. His fullness is not any of these things. The Lord&rsquo;s fullness is the rich content of all that God is, and this fullness dwells in Christ bodily. Fullness does not refer to material things.</p>
<p>The fullness is nothing other than the element of God Himself, the content of what God is. The entire Gospel of John is needed in order to explain the introductory word in 1:1-18. Because verse 16 says, &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received,&rdquo; we should be able to find references to the content of this fullness throughout the entire Gospel of John. Of all the four Gospels, only the Gospel of John describes the Lord Jesus in relation to so many items.</p>
<p>This Gospel speaks of the Lord Jesus in reference to life, grace, reality, the way, and light (1:4, 14; 14:6; 8:12). In fact, there are at least thirty-one items related to the Lord Jesus; sixteen of these items are in chapter 1 alone. He is the Word (v. 1); God (v. 1); life (v. 3); light (v. 4); flesh (v. 14); the tabernacle (v. 14); grace (v. 14); reality (v. 14); the only Begotten of the Father (vv. 14, 18); the Son of God (vv. 34, 49); the Lamb (v. 29); the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit (v. 33); Christ, the Messiah (v. 41); a man, a Nazarene (v. 45); a king, the King of Israel (v. 49); and the Son of Man (v. 51).</p>
<p>In addition to these items, there are at least another fifteen items. The Lord Jesus is the temple (2:21), the Bridegroom (3:29), the One who came from above (v. 31), the One who is above all (v. 31), the One who gives the Spirit not by measure (v. 34), the One who inherits all things (v. 35), the living fountain (4:14), the Savior of the world (v. 42), the bread of life (6:35), the door of the sheep (10:9), the good Shepherd (v. 11), resurrection (11:25), a grain of wheat (12:24), the way (14:6), and the vine (15:1). These items and the items in chapter 1 add up to thirty-one items. If we want to know the fullness in the Lord Jesus, we need to know these thirty-one items. Every item speaks of His content, and this content is related to His fullness, which we cannot exhaust in our experience.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING GRACE ACCORDING TO HIS FULLNESS</h2>
<p>Our initial salvation is the first step in our receiving of His fullness; we experience that the Lord Jesus is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world, who was judged by God, and who suffered the penalty of death on the cross. When we heard the gospel and realized that we were sinners, we did not feel peaceful within and our conscience condemned us. At that time, the Holy Spirit declared to us that the Lord is the Lamb of God (16:13), who bore our sins on the cross and received God&rsquo;s judgment on our behalf, shedding His redeeming blood so that our sins could be forgiven. Quite spontaneously, we thanked the Lord for bearing our sins, suffering judgment on our behalf, and shedding His blood. Thus, we received of His fullness, which includes His bearing of our sins, His redeeming us from sins, and His suffering judgment on our behalf. We escaped judgment and received the forgiveness of sins through grace according to His fullness.</p>
<p>When we received Him, thanked Him, and worshipped Him, our inner being became bright and full of light. Furthermore, we became clear concerning our relationship with God, our origin and destiny, and the meaning of human life, which were previously confusing and incomprehensible to us. At the time of our salvation, even though we could not explain the light in our inner being nor speak of Him being light in us, this was our true condition. Thus, in addition to receiving Him as the Lamb, we received of His fullness as light.</p>
<p>When we received the Lord and there was the shining of light in us, we had a sense to no longer speak as we once did and even to no longer go to the places we once enjoyed. Spontaneously, we stopped doing many things. Even the things that we once looked at no longer appealed to us. Without any conscious decision, our taste for things changed. The only explanation was that the Lord as life was living in us. When we received Him as life, our taste spontaneously changed. We no longer liked the things that we formerly liked, and we no longer loved the things that we formerly loved. Spontaneously, our taste for our hobbies fell away. This was an issue of receiving of His fullness.</p>
<p>After we believed in the Lord Jesus, we felt that we were close to God and more transcendent than before, but we also were more willing to be lowly. Formerly, the further we were from God, the more we felt that we were great and noble, but after we were saved and closer to God, there was more of a willingness in us to be lowly. On one hand, we fellowshipped with God and were transcendent, but on the other hand, we were very lowly before others. This is an experience related to incarnation. When the Lord came to the earth, He was God, but He was also a lowly man from Nazareth. This shows that we received the content of incarnation according to His fullness.</p>
<p>As we follow Him and fellowship with Him, we will have many experiences related to His fullness. We will sense the Lord&rsquo;s kingship, realizing that the Lord Jesus is not only the Savior but also the King. When we began to meet in northern China over thirty years ago, I came across a portion in the Psalms that says, &ldquo;O Jehovah of hosts, my King and my God&rdquo; (84:3). This verse was so powerful that it caused me to prostrate myself before God and say, &ldquo;O God, I have never acknowledged You as my King. Thank You and praise You! Today I have a deep feeling that You are not only my Savior, my Lord, my God, and my Father, but also my King. I want to submit to Your authority.&rdquo; At that time I began to understand the meaning of being prostrate before the Lord. After following the Lord for a period of time, many children come to the realization that our Lord is the glorious King. This is an experience of receiving of His fullness.</p>
<p>When we receive grace according to His fullness, we also will experience His sweet and balanced humanity. The more we love God, look like God, and are filled with God inwardly, the more we will express such a humanity outwardly. When I began to serve the Lord, I was rather strict. For example, when I was invited to a meal, I would sit without swaying my body or speaking loosely. When someone politely passed a dish to me, I would feel that he was being artificial. When the host remarked that not enough food had been prepared, I would think, &ldquo;This is not truthful. There are so many dishes on the table, but he still says that there is not enough food.&rdquo; Although I outwardly partook of the meal in a proper way, I would condemn others inwardly for being hypocrites and full of pretense. As I began to receive more of the Lord&rsquo;s fullness, however, I began to realize that my attitude was lacking in simple humanity. I was more like a stiff piece of wood than I was a man. Thankfully, the flavor of my humanity has increased over time.</p>
<p>About twenty years ago, I was having fellowship with some brothers and sisters in northern China. They were asking many questions, and I was answering them continually. We talked from the morning until one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Realizing that they must be hungry, I asked, &ldquo;Are you all hungry?&rdquo; A recently saved sister immediately replied, &ldquo;Oh, we are not fleshly.&rdquo; This word was very strong, and it sounded as if eating would cause them to be fleshly. I could only smile. Then they continued to ask questions, and I continued to answer them. After two o&rsquo;clock I said, &ldquo;There are probably many brothers and sisters who need to eat.&rdquo; Another new sister replied, &ldquo;None of us wants to be a Martha.&rdquo; These comments showed that the newly saved ones were lacking in a flavor of genuine humanity. They had the Word, but in their experience the Word had not become flesh. If we truly have the Word in our experience, the Word will become flesh. Christians should not merely pursue spirituality and neglect practical things. If a meal had been prepared, we could have continued our fellowship in an even more pleasant environment. Preparing a meal does not make one a Martha but rather a man, like Jesus the Nazarene. There is nothing fleshly about being concerned for the saints; it is even more spiritual because it testifies of the Word becoming flesh.</p>
<p>The fullness of the Lord Jesus is too great. In the Gospel of John alone there are at least thirty-one items of what He is. He is high, because He is God; He is low, because He is a man, even a man from a poor family and a despised place. He is truly high and truly low; He is truly great and truly small. The content of God is in Him, and the content of man is in Him as well. He is so full.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING GRACE UPON GRACE</h2>
<p>John 1:16 says, &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; The phrase <em>grace upon grace</em> indicates that grace is like sea waves that come upon the shore one after another. For example, when we are newly saved, we touch the elements of His redemption, of His bearing of our sins, and of His being judged on our behalf. Our sins are forgiven, and we have joy and peace. Thus, we receive of His fullness. After a period of time, our inner being becomes bright and full of light. Then grace comes as life and continues to come as lowliness and submission to the Lord&rsquo;s kingship. Gradually, grace comes to us as the living of God in our humanity. Although we are a man living on the earth, the source of our living is the life of God within us. All these experiences cause us to not only see but also touch something, that is, to see and touch the element of His fullness as grace. In this way we receive and experience grace upon grace, and more of His element becomes our element. This is grace upon grace in our experience.</p>
<p>At the end of 1934, some of the co-workers who lived in Shanghai prayed with fasting on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, asking the Lord for His promises related to the upcoming year. One co-worker received a word while in prayer: &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection&rdquo; (Phil. 3:10). He felt that this was the Lord&rsquo;s word to him, but he did not know the reason for this word. Not too long after, he encountered a particular environment that he could not bear. When he asked the Lord about this situation, he had an inward realization that the Lord allowed it so that he could know Christ and the power of His resurrection. Then he gave himself to the Lord, and throughout this time he experienced the power of resurrection. Later, he was placed in another situation with a person whom he did not love and for whom he had no strength to love. Even though he knew that he needed to love this person, he had no love for him. This situation was not related to his learning how to love but to showing him that he had no love in himself and that he could not love by himself. When he sought the Lord about this situation, the Lord said, &ldquo;This is for you to know Me and the power of My resurrection.&rdquo; The Lord showed him that He was the love in him and that the power of His resurrection was the source of this love. Then the brother said to the Lord, &ldquo;I give myself to You. I am unable to love, and I have no way to change. I give myself to You. You are in me as my life, and You have the power of resurrection. This is Your business.&rdquo; Spontaneously, he began to experience Christ as love in him, enabling him to love the one whom he could not love. This is grace upon grace. Day by day, as we receive more of the Lord, more of His element becomes our element, and more of His fullness becomes our fullness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM THE FLESH<br />
BY RECEIVING OF THE LORD&rsquo;S FULLNESS</h2>
<p>After Paul says, &ldquo;You have been made full in Him,&rdquo; in Colossians 2:10, he gives an example of being made full. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.&rdquo; We cannot deal with our flesh and lusts; however, there is an element in the fullness of Christ that can circumcise us. Once this element in His fullness enters into us, it has the effect of circumcising us.</p>
<p>For example, after being saved, our previous fleshly indulgences often continue to encumber us. However, as we gradually receive more of His fullness, these indulgences begin to fall away. Some weaknesses cannot be overcome quickly, even though others may admonish us and we may make many resolutions. As we receive grace upon grace, however, these weaknesses begin to fall away spontaneously.</p>
<p>After being saved, a brother may have no problem other than losing his temper with his wife. He may be patient with everyone except his wife. Although he knows and acknowledges this problem, and even condemns it, he cannot overcome it. However, as long as he is receiving of the Lord&rsquo;s fullness with grace upon grace, this is not really a problem. Eventually, he will receive the grace that will kill his temper toward his wife.</p>
<p>I know of a brother who was saved for many years, but he did not like to read the Bible, and even when he read the Bible, he found it difficult to understand. He was familiar with the words in the Bible, but he did not understand what he was reading. Furthermore, he could not sing any of the hymns. In one meeting, however, all the saints experienced the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. As a result of this receiving, he was able to sing the words in the hymnal and understand the words in the Bible. His mind was opened as a result of this receiving. This is God&rsquo;s grace. &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; This word is true! His fullness is like an immeasurable and unlimited ocean. His grace is like ocean waves that come to us one after another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL RECEIVING OF HIS FULLNESS</h2>
<p>Although John 1:16 says, &ldquo;Of His fullness we have all received,&rdquo; this does not mean that we have received everything of His fullness. His fullness is inexhaustible. The word <em>all</em> refers to us, to those who have received the fullness. Every saved person has received of His fullness. Paul received it, John received it, and we have received it. All the saved ones have received of His fullness. Although some have received more and others less, all have received. Furthermore, we have grace upon grace; we can receive, obtain, and enjoy grace upon grace. Every experience of grace involves an element of Himself. The more we receive His grace, the more we will be filled with His element, and the more His fullness will become our fullness. May we learn to be those who receive grace, ceasing from our struggling, striving, and reliance on ourselves. Everything that we have, we have received from Him. Praise the Lord that we can receive of His fullness as grace upon grace.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE DECLARATION<br />
OF THE ONLY BEGOTTEN SON</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:18; 5:19-20; 6:38; 7:16-18, 28-29; 8:13-16; 10:30, 37-38; 14:7-11; 17:21-22</h1>
<p>John 1:1-18 is an introduction to the Gospel of John. In this chapter, we will cover the last item in this introduction: &ldquo;The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (v. 18). This statement points out that God the Father is declared only through the Son; there is no declaration of God other than the declaration of the only begotten Son.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING TRIUNE&mdash;THREE YET ONE</h2>
<p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; This verse says that no one has ever seen God, but then it speaks of &ldquo;the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father,&rdquo; not &ldquo;the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of God.&rdquo; We must pay attention to the fact that John changes the term from <em>God</em> to <em>Father.</em> This points to the mystery of the Triune God. Whenever we speak of the Lord declaring the Father and expressing God, we must realize that this is a matter related to God being triune&mdash;three yet one.</p>
<p><em>Him</em> in verse 18 refers to God, not to the Father. We need to understand that <em>God</em> at the beginning of the verse includes both the Father and the Son; it does not refer only to the Father. The Father is God, and the Son is also God. We may use a hand as an analogy, although this illustration is not fully adequate. A hand has a palm and five fingers; that is, a hand includes a palm as well as five fingers. Similarly, God involves the Father as well as the Son. The Father is God, and the Son is also God. The Son is not apart from God. The Bible does not reveal two Gods; it reveals only one God.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John contains two sections. The first thirteen chapters speak of the Lord&rsquo;s coming, and the last eight chapters speak of the Lord&rsquo;s going. The entire Gospel of John speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s coming and going. In the Lord&rsquo;s coming, the Father is in the Son; in the Lord&rsquo;s going, the Son became the Spirit. In the Lord&rsquo;s coming, the Father came among men in the Son; in the Lord&rsquo;s going, the Son became the Spirit to enter into men (10:30, 37-38; 14:16-18). The Lord&rsquo;s coming was His incarnation, and His going was His death and resurrection. When the Word became flesh, the Son came with the Father among men. When the Lord went through death and resurrection, He became the Spirit to enter into the disciples. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s coming and going are a story of the Word&rsquo;s incarnation and of the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection; it is a story of the Son coming from the Father and with the Father and of the Son becoming the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Father is in the Son, and the Son has become the Spirit; this is the story of the Triune God. God is one, but in person He is three. Although there are three persons&mdash;Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;they are not three separate Gods. We can use another inadequate illustration. Ice, water, and vapor are actually the same thing in three different forms. Ice, when heated, becomes water; water, when heated, becomes vapor. The opposite is also true. When vapor meets cold air, it becomes water, and if the water is cooled down further, it becomes ice. Hence, ice becomes water, and water becomes vapor. Vapor turns into water, and water again turns into ice. Ice, water, and vapor are three forms of one substance.</p>
<p>There is only one God, but this one God is revealed in three persons. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; Here we see that God incorporates both the Father and the Son. In chapter 14 we see that God also incorporates the Spirit. God is not only the Father and the Son, but the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>God the Father, who dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16), was hidden in eternity. God the Son came forth from eternity and entered into time. He came from the heavens to the earth, from a realm of unapproachable light to a place where He could be contacted. He came forth in this way and was manifested among men and contacted by man as the Son. However, if He were only the Son, He could be contacted by man but He could not enter into man. When the Lord Jesus was on earth prior to His death and resurrection, He walked with Peter, James, John, and the other disciples, but He could not enter into them. For this reason, He had to change in form. Through death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, and He came to the disciples to enter into them as the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; John 20:22). As the Spirit, He is able to enter into man. This is the Triune God.</p>
<p>The Father is the source, and the Son is the manifestation, the declaration. As the source, God dwells in unapproachable light in eternity in heaven as the Father. As the declaration, God is manifested to man as the Son. It is not necessary to ask whether or not a person has a father, because everyone has a father. Whenever we see a person, we see a son. Every son has a father. However, we cannot say that every man is a father because in order to be a father, a person must have at least one child. Although a son certainly represents his father, he may not be a father. Thus, the function of declaration belongs to a son, because not all men are fathers. A son always declares his father, because the declaration of a father depends on a son. Everyone who sees us knows that we have a father because we are a son.</p>
<p>It is also possible to have some understanding of a father by looking at his son. A son always expresses his father. A son resembles his father, not only in facial features but often in disposition and temperament. From the father&rsquo;s perspective, the father is the source of the son. From the son&rsquo;s perspective, the son is the declaration of the father, the expression of the father. The father is the source, and the son is the expression.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Son; hence, He expresses the Father. However, if the Lord Jesus were merely the Son, He could not enter into us. Prior to His death, the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, &ldquo;Where I am going, you cannot come&rdquo; (13:33). <em>Going</em> is not a pleasant word. When someone we love tells us that he is going, we are not happy. Hence, when the Lord said that He was going, the disciples were sorrowful. Consequently, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not let your heart be troubled&rdquo; (14:1). Later, He said, &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you&rdquo; (16:7). He said that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality, to be with them always (14:16-17). The Spirit of reality is the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus. If He did not go, that is, if He did not pass through death and resurrection, He would not have been able to enter into the disciples as the Spirit. Because He went, the Spirit of reality was able to enter into the disciples to be with them always (vv. 16-20).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit comes in order to enter into man. The Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation, and the Spirit is the entering in. God is one in three persons. In His being hidden, unfathomable, and unapproachable, He is the source, the Father. In His being manifested for men to see, contact, touch, and know, He is revealed as the Son. In His entering into man to live in man, touch and operate in man, He is experienced as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Our relationship with God and our knowledge and experience of God must reflect these three stages. We need to acknowledge that God is both hidden and unfathomable (Rom. 11:33). We need to further acknowledge that God has been manifested among us and to us in the person of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus (1 Tim. 3:16; 2 Tim. 1:9-10; 1 Pet. 1:20; 1 John 4:2). We must acknowledge the Father and acknowledge the Son. As those who are saved, we must also acknowledge the glorious fact that the Spirit has entered into us to speak in us and operate in us (Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Tim. 1:14). When we have the Spirit, we have the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father.</p>
<p>A person who only acknowledges God as the source may not have the Son, the God who has been revealed and manifested. If he only acknowledges the existence of God, he cannot receive the Son, and in order to receive the Son, he must receive the Spirit. When the Holy Spirit touches a person and knocks on the door of his heart, he must open his heart and receive the Lord Jesus as his Savior. Then the Holy Spirit will enter into him. When a person has the Spirit, he has the Son, and when he has the Son, he has the Father.</p>
<p>In our salvation we experience the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. However, our experience does not begin with the Father but with the Spirit. Once we receive the Spirit, we give ground in our being to the Son, and when we have the Son, we have the Father. When we were first saved, we did not know how to explain this, but we experienced it. We all can recall the Holy Spirit knocking on the door of our heart and moving us to open our heart and confess that we were sinners in order to receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior. At that moment the Holy Spirit entered into us. As soon as we experienced this, we had a sense that the Lord was in us, and we also had a deep sense that God was our Father.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DECLARATION OF THE ONLY BEGOTTEN<br />
IN THE BOSOM OF THE FATHER</h2>
<p>As the only Begotten of the Father, the Son is the unique One who has declared God: &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (John 1:18). There is only one declaration, because the Son is the only Begotten. The Son&rsquo;s status as the only Begotten makes His declaration unique. There is only one Son; there is not another Son. Hence, God&rsquo;s declaration is also one. No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son has declared God. When the Son was incarnated, God was manifested among men.</p>
<p>The word <em>bosom</em> in verse 18 implies nearness. When a mother embraces her own child in her bosom, it speaks of her nearness, dearness, and love for the child. What a person places in his bosom is something that is dearly loved. Hence, <em>the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father</em> means that the Lord is the One who is most dear, most loved, and most delightful to the Father. In the universe there is not one who is more dear and lovable to the Father than the Son. The only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father is the One who is most dear, lovely, delightful, and near to the Father.</p>
<p>Because the Son is so dear, lovely, delightful, and near to the Father, when He comes forth to declare the Father, His declaration is complete. The only begotten Son in the bosom of the Father is the One most dear, most loved, and most delightful to the Father; He cannot be any closer to the Father. The Son understands and comprehends all that the Father is and has, including the Father&rsquo;s intention. Therefore, the Son is the expression, the declaration, of God. He declares God in the fullest way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>The first verse in the introduction to the Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1), and the last verse in the introduction says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&rdquo; (v. 18). Following verse 18 John begins to present case after case to show the Son&rsquo;s declaration of the Father. The entire Gospel of John is a further explanation of this matter.</p>
<p>When a person first reads the Gospel of John, he may think that it is merely the record of a Jewish man. This response is like the reaction of the Samaritan woman in chapter 4. When the Lord Jesus asked her for water, her first thought was related to her realization that a Jewish man was asking a Samaritan woman for water (v. 9). When we first read the Gospel of John, our first thought concerning the Lord Jesus may have been that He was a man. However, when we read it again, we had a deeper sense that the Lord Jesus was different from other men. When we read it a third time, we had a sense that this difference was rather pronounced, and when we read it a fourth time, we had a sense that He was different because God was being expressed through Him.</p>
<p>We often praise the Lord at the table meeting, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, there is love in Your heart, there is grace on Your lips, and Your words are full of grace.&rdquo; Although this utterance is not bad, it is based on our natural concepts. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus did not always speak sweet words. Sometimes He spoke harsh words. For example, He said, &ldquo;You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father&rdquo; (8:44). Such a word would not cause people to feel that there was love in His heart and grace on His lips. However, even when the Lord spoke harsh words, God was coming forth from Him. His rejoicing was of God, and His weeping was of God. His meekness was of God, and His wrath was of God.</p>
<p>The more we read the Gospel of John, the more we have a sense that all His words and actions were an expression of God. Today many Christians view the Lord Jesus in a limited way. They see only His goodness, sacrifice, and love as a man. These descriptions are not wrong, but they are not complete, because the Lord Jesus was not living according to His human goodness or human love; rather, He was living out God.</p>
<p>In chapter 4 the Lord was tired, hungry, and thirsty, so He went to the well at Sychar. When a woman came to draw water, He conversed with her in words that expressed more than just goodness or mercy. He expressed the omniscient God, the One who knows the secrets of man&rsquo;s heart, but who is also willing to contact sinners! Some may say, &ldquo;His contact with people surely shows His goodness and mercy.&rdquo; I agree that it does. However, if we think that only goodness and love were revealed, we are lacking a full appreciation of Him. We must recognize that His goodness and mercy were declarations of God Himself.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, God was certainly expressed. However, those who were around the Lord still spoke foolishly, saying, &ldquo;This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world&rdquo; (6:14). Some may view this case as simply showing the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and compassion for the hungry crowd. Surely the crowd must have thought of Him as being good and merciful. They even came the next day because they had this thought. When they came, however, the Lord did not give them any bread; instead, He said to them, &ldquo;You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled. Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 26-27). This word was more than a display of mercy; it was an expression of the God who wanted to be received by man. He wanted people to receive Him.</p>
<p>In chapter 8 the Pharisees brought a sinful woman before the Lord and asked if she should be stoned. The Lord did not reply, because He could say neither yes nor no. In fact, He was not there to declare what was right and what was wrong; He was declaring God. When He finally answered, He said, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her&rdquo; (v. 7). His speaking manifested God. Who is without sin? Only God is without sin. The Pharisees were interested in right and wrong, but the Lord&rsquo;s reply expressed God. After His reply, they all went out one by one, beginning with the older ones. When only the Lord and the woman were left, He asked, &ldquo;Has no one condemned you?&rdquo; (v. 10). She said, &ldquo;No one, Lord.&rdquo; Then the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more&rdquo; (v. 11). Is this merely goodness and mercy? No, this is God being expressed. Even though He was a genuine man, He lived out, expressed, and declared God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DECLARING THE FATHER<br />
BY LIVING ACCORDING TO THE FATHER</h2>
<p>The Lord lived out God because He spoke and worked by the Father. Although He was a Jewish man from Nazareth, He lived a life of denial and rejection. The Lord was rejected and denied not only by others, but even more, He rejected Himself. He said, &ldquo;The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner&rdquo; (5:19). He also said, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works&rdquo; (14:10). The Lord knew that the Father was in Him; hence, He lived out the Father.</p>
<p>This is the key point of the Gospel of John: in the living and person of a genuine man from Nazareth, only God was declared. No one has ever seen God, but the Son declared Him. The Son could declare God because God lived in Him and was His life, but even more, He could declare God because He did not live by His genuine and perfect human life. The Lord Jesus could have lived by His human life or by the divine life, and of these two possibilities, He chose to live by God. If He had lived by His human life, He would have been independent from God, and He would have failed to express God just as Adam failed. However, the Lord Jesus chose to live by the Father. He was a man who lived by God with the divine life, not by Himself with His human life. Hence, He expressed and declared God.</p>
<p>As we live on the earth, we also face these two possibilities: we can live by ourselves, or we can live by the indwelling God. With the first possibility we can only live out ourselves, but with the second possibility we can live out God. Before the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the only begotten Son was the unique One who declared God. Today there is the need for many sons to declare God. God dwells in us as our life; this is a fact. The only issue that we face is whether or not we will allow the cross to work deeply in us. Through the work of the cross, will we allow our words and actions to be terminated so that He can speak and act in us? May we deny and forsake ourselves, learn to put ourselves under the cross, and not live by ourselves but rather by Him. May we speak by Him and act by Him. If this is our case, God will be declared in us. God&rsquo;s declaration was once possible only through His only begotten Son. Today God can be declared through His many sons. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may learn the lesson of declaring God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

<p>We will now look at John 1:19-51, beginning with the matter of the Lamb and the dove.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GENERAL IDEA OF THE INTRODUCTION<br />
OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>From the introduction of the Gospel of John we know that the Lord Jesus is the Word of God. Before the beginning of time in eternity past, the Word of God, the explanation of God, existed. At the beginning of time He created all things, and then at a certain point in time, He came among men to be life to man. His life is the light of man, and this light shines in the darkness. Although some reject the light, others receive it, obtaining God Himself and being given the authority to become children of God. Those who receive Him are not only created by God but also born of God. As such, they can receive God as grace, touch God as reality, and enjoy God&rsquo;s fullness. The unfathomable and unapproachable God has been declared to man through the Word in order to be received, mingled, enjoyed, and experienced practically.</p>
<p>God created man and came to be man&rsquo;s life so that man may be born of God to enjoy Him as grace and reality and also to enjoy His fullness. The end result of this enjoyment is His tabernacling in man and among man. Thus, the unfathomable and unapproachable God can dwell among man and in man. This dwelling also speaks of God and man being mingled together; that is, of the Word becoming flesh and tabernacling among men.</p>
<p>This revelation is not according to man&rsquo;s natural concept, and it is apart from revelation. This is something that has not come up in man&rsquo;s heart (1 Cor. 2:9). This is also not a matter that man can easily receive because the thought of God being the Word not only to create all things but also to enter into created man is not something that has ever come up in our natural thought. The matters of being mingled with God by receiving Him, of enjoying His fullness, and of becoming the tabernacle of God on earth also have not come up in our heart. Nevertheless, these matters are presented in the introduction to the Gospel of John. The introduction is an outline, a brief explanation, of the entire book. We need to speak of these matters repeatedly because they are not according to our human concepts.</p>
<p>After the introduction, John presents many details that support these points. The first detail relates to the testimony of John the Baptist concerning the Lord Jesus; his description of the Lord is unique, and it matches the unique writing style of John.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE WRITING STYLE OF<br />
THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>Careful readers of the Bible all acknowledge that the Gospel of John is written in a unique way. Whenever John speaks of a particular incident, he presents the background and context of the case before he introduces the central figure. For example, in chapter 4 the Lord Jesus and His disciples were wearied from their journey, and they were hungry and thirsty. With this as the background, the Lord stopped at a well, met a woman who had come to draw water, and asked the woman for a drink. The background is one of hunger and thirst, and the context is entirely about water. With this background and context, John portrays the Lord Jesus as the One who is able to supply living water to quench people&rsquo;s thirst forever.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 the Lord Jesus caused a weak and dying person to be enlivened and strengthened. In order to describe this incident, John presents a background that references many elements in Judaism, including feasts, the city of Jerusalem, angels, and the Sabbath (vv. 1-4, 9). In such a religious atmosphere, the immediate context included a multitude of sick people. This multitude was not a group of happy people who were walking, standing, and singing; rather, they were dying. Consequently, they were lying and waiting for an angel to come and stir up the water in the pool in the hope that they could be the first to step into the pool and be healed (v. 4). Even though they adhered to the letter of religion, their weaknesses could not be healed. This is a sign of death. When the Lord Jesus saw a man who had been sick for thirty-eight years lying by the pool, He asked, &ldquo;Do you want to get well?&rdquo; (v. 6). The man said, &ldquo;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me&rdquo; (v. 7). Religion seemingly has a means to heal, but he did not have the strength to receive any healing. In such a situation of despair, the Lord Jesus manifested Himself as the Lord who can turn weakness to strength and death to life.</p>
<p>In every case in the Gospel of John, there is always a description of the background and then a specific context related to the background in order to show what the Lord is and how His life can overcome the background and subdue the environment. His ability to overcome the background and subdue the environment shows how His life, which cannot be limited or restrained, meets every need and solves every problem. This is the unique writing style of the Gospel of John.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BACKGROUND OF THE JEWISH RELIGION</h2>
<p>The first incident that John describes using this style of writing occurs in the second half of chapter 1. In verses 19 through 51 he presents a background involving the Jewish religion and the context of John the Baptist&rsquo;s testimony. The background and the context show that the expectations, focus, and speaking of those in religion do not correspond to God&rsquo;s intention in the universe.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s presentation of the background of religion involves Judaism, which is not an ordinary heathen religion. Judaism is a true religion, and it is based on God&rsquo;s revelation in the age of the Old Testament. Verse 19 says that the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to John the Baptist. Priests and Levites are the main figures in Judaism. The priests are in the central position, and the Levites are in a supporting position. These religious people came to ask John the Baptist, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; (vv. 19, 22). They had studied the Old Testament thoroughly and understood it well, and they knew of God&rsquo;s promise in the Old Testament of a coming Messiah. <em>Messiah</em> is a Hebrew word, and when it is translated into Greek, it is &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; (v. 41). In their reading of the Old Testament, these priests and Levites knew that Elijah was coming and that God would raise up a Prophet, just as He had raised up Moses (Mal. 4:5; Deut. 18:15, 18). When John the Baptist came, his clothes and food were quite different; nevertheless, he spoke with much power and authority (Matt. 3:1-12). Consequently, these religious people wanted to know if he was the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet (John 1:20-21).</p>
<p>When they came to ask John the Baptist, he told them clearly, &ldquo;I am not the Christ&rdquo; (v. 20). They then asked, &ldquo;What then? Are you Elijah?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo; They asked again, &ldquo;Are you the Prophet?&rdquo; John answered, &ldquo;No&rdquo; (v. 21). Then they became confused and asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; (v. 22). He said, &ldquo;I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness, &lsquo;Make straight the way of the Lord!&rsquo; as Isaiah the prophet said&rdquo; (v. 23). John the Baptist acknowledged that he was only the voice that Isaiah had prophesied would come and cry out in the wilderness (Isa. 40:3). He said that he was only a voice crying in the wilderness, &ldquo;Make straight the way of the Lord.&rdquo; Then they asked, &ldquo;Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?&rdquo; (John 1:25). John answered them, &ldquo;I baptize in water; but among you stands One whom you do not know&rdquo; (v. 26). John&rsquo;s word was a recommendation of Christ, but they did not recognize Christ or even understand John&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>After describing this religious background in verses 19 through 28, the apostle John continued to describe the immediate context of John the Baptist&rsquo;s speaking. Verse 29 says, &ldquo;The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; John the Baptist did not refer to the Lord as Christ, the Prophet, or Elijah. Although the Lord Jesus was the Christ and also the Prophet, John the Baptist did not refer to Him in this way. He spoke of the Lord in a way that was contrary to the religious background presented in this chapter. John said that the Lord Jesus was the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. John the Baptist even acknowledged that this was contrary to his understanding, saying, &ldquo;I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 33). When John baptized the Lord Jesus in water, he saw the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him as a dove (v. 32; Matt. 3:13-17). This is the reason that John did not refer to the Lord Jesus as the Christ or the Prophet. Rather, he referred to the Lord as &ldquo;He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (John 1:33). John the Baptist&rsquo;s special reference to introduce Christ was in contrast to the Jewish religion.</p>
<p>John the Baptist spoke of two things in contrast to the background of Judaism: &ldquo;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Christ is the Lamb, and the Spirit descended upon Him as a dove. Consequently, John did not speak of Him as the Christ or the Prophet but as the Lamb with the Spirit as a dove. According to the background of Judaism, people discussed the coming of the Messiah, the appearance of the Prophet, and the coming of Elijah (Mal. 4:5). However, when John the Baptist began to testify of the coming Lord, he did not speak of Him as the Christ, the Prophet, or Elijah. In contrast to these concepts, he spoke of the Lamb of God upon whom the Spirit descended and abided as a dove. The testimony of John the Baptist was completely contrary to the background of Judaism.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>The testimony of John the Baptist was very powerful. When two of his disciples heard these words, they immediately followed the Lord Jesus (John 1:37). Verse 38 says, &ldquo;Jesus, turning and beholding them following, said to them, What are you seeking? And they said to Him, Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?&rdquo; The way they addressed the Lord Jesus shows that their religious concepts were quite strong. Nevertheless, they did not dare to call Him the Christ, the Prophet, or Elijah, because they were not sure who He was. However, they also realized that He was worthy of respect; hence, they addressed Him as &ldquo;Rabbi.&rdquo; Although John the Baptist testified of Him, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God,&rdquo; the two disciples addressed Him as &ldquo;Rabbi.&rdquo; These two titles&mdash;<em>the Lamb of God</em> and <em>Rabbi</em>&mdash;are altogether different.</p>
<p>From these verses we can see the influence of the background of Judaism on the disciples&rsquo; religious concepts. Under the influence of Judaism, people were looking for the Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah, and in an environment filled with such religious concepts, the disciples could address the Lord Jesus only as Rabbi. No one recognized Him as the Lamb of God, as the One upon whom the Spirit descended and abided as a dove, or as the One who would baptize people in the Holy Spirit. Without revelation, the disciples were limited by their religious background and could focus only on the Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah, and based on these religious concepts, they could address the Lord only as Rabbi.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when the two disciples heard the testimony of John the Baptist, they followed the Lord Jesus and asked where He was staying. Our Lord&rsquo;s response shows that He truly is the Lord. He replied, &ldquo;Come, and you will see&rdquo; (v. 39). He did not correct their understanding of Him as being only a Rabbi, nor did He answer their question. He simply asked them to come and see. The Lord was not asking them to come and see His dwelling place, but to come with Him in order to see the Lord Himself. Only the Lord Himself matters, not the place where He stays. If a robber dwells in a palace, the palace is still a robber&rsquo;s den. If a king dwells in a thatched shed, the shed is a palace. No dwelling place is more important than the dweller. Therefore, the Lord Jesus simply said, &ldquo;Come, and you will see.&rdquo; The Lord did not want them to see a dwelling place but to see the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>In order to know a person, we must see that he is more than what he says. What a person is counts more than what he speaks. Everyone in the world is afraid of being seen for who they are, but the Lord Jesus is not. He is not afraid of detailed scrutiny. He even desires that we see Him, because He can bear any amount of scrutiny. He is the same in every situation.</p>
<p>When the two disciples heard the Lord&rsquo;s words, they followed Him and stayed with Him that day (v. 39). The place where the Lord stayed must have been quite simple and primitive; however, when the two disciples stayed with Him, they discovered that He was quite extraordinary and altogether different. They were captured by Him. One of the two disciples was Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother. He went to look for his brother Peter and said to him, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah&rdquo; (v. 41). He did not say, &ldquo;We have found the Lamb,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We have found the One who will baptize people in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; On the contrary, he said, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah.&rdquo; Again, this word was based on his religious concepts, but Andrew still led Peter to the Lord Jesus. As soon as the Lord Jesus saw Peter, He said, &ldquo;You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas,&rdquo; (which John says is interpreted, Peter) (v. 42). With this simple contact, Peter was gained by the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>The next day the Lord Jesus went forth into Galilee. When the Lord found Philip, He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; (v. 43). Philip was probably influenced by Andrew and Peter, so when the Lord called Philip, he followed the Lord. When Philip found Nathanael, he said, &ldquo;We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth&rdquo; (v. 45). Philip&rsquo;s words again show the strong religious background at that time. Nathanael rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&rdquo; (v. 46). Nathanael said this because he understood from the Old Testament that the Messiah would come from Bethlehem, not from Nazareth. Philip, however, was very quick, and he immediately said, &ldquo;Come and see&rdquo; (v. 46). He could not speak clearly about the Lord, so he asked Nathanael to come and see for himself. When the Lord Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, He said, &ldquo;Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile!&rdquo; (v. 47). Greatly surprised, Nathanael said to the Lord, &ldquo;How do You know me?&rdquo; Then the Lord Jesus said more clearly, &ldquo;Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you&rdquo; (v. 48). As soon as the Lord said this, Nathanael was subdued, and he said to the Lord, &ldquo;Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel&rdquo; (v. 49). Although Nathanael confessed that the Lord was the Son of God, he was still influenced by his strong religious background because he also addressed the Lord as Rabbi and as the King of Israel.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TESTIMONY OF JOHN THE BAPTIST</h2>
<p>John the Baptist said, &ldquo;He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God&rdquo; (vv. 33-34). John did not say that the Lord Jesus was the Christ or even that He was a Rabbi; he only spoke of Him as the Son of God. John spoke according to revelation, not religious concepts. The use of titles such as <em>Rabbi, King of Israel,</em> and <em>Messiah</em> all indicate the influence of religious concepts.</p>
<p>John the Baptist was a forerunner, and he spoke according to revelation in the midst of the background of Judaism. The Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah are not more significant than the Lamb and the dove. Today both Christians and Gentiles pay more attention to religious concepts involving the Messiah, the Prophet, and Elijah than they do to the revelation of the Lord as the Lamb and as the One upon whom the Spirit descends and abides as a dove. On one hand, He is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world; on the other hand, the Spirit abides on Him as a dove so that people may receive the Holy Spirit. This is not a religious concept; it is a revelation of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WORK DEPENDING UPON<br />
THE LAMB AND THE DOVE</h2>
<p>The Lord as the Word became flesh in order to enter into us as life so that we may receive God, experience God, and enjoy God fully. Moreover, He wants us to enjoy God to the extent that we are mingled with God as one and built up by God as His dwelling place. The fulfillment of this desire depends upon the Lamb and the dove. The religious background and environment of the Messiah, the Prophet, and Elijah do not matter; only the Lamb and the dove matter. The Word, who was in the beginning, became a lowly man, grew up in a despised place, and as the Lamb of God, took away the sin of the world. Furthermore, the dove, signifying the Spirit, is upon Him for the purpose of imparting the Spirit of God to man. As the Lamb of God, He solves man&rsquo;s problem of sin before God. The Lamb has taken away the sin of man before God. As the One who has the dove, the Holy Spirit, He can supply all of the fullness of God to man.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose in this universe is not merely that man would draw near and contact Him but that man would receive Him as grace and reality. God desires to enter into man to be life, to live in man, to mingle Himself with man, and to become one with man. This is God&rsquo;s desire. God created man as a vessel to contain God Himself. However, before God could enter into man, sin entered into man, and man was filled with sins. God&rsquo;s intention that we be filled with grace and reality was hindered by our being filled with vanity and refuse related to our fleshly lusts, covetousness, preferences, and perverseness. These problems had to be solved before God could enter into us.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to solve these problems, but He did not come as the Messiah or the Prophet, much less as Elijah; He came as the Lamb of God. According to the righteousness of God, He took away our defilement related to sin and sins. On the cross He solved the problem of sin. When John the Baptist testified, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God&rdquo; (v. 29), he was implying that our relationship with the Lord is not based on His being the Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah but rather on His being the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world. He came to be the Lamb of God because of our need for redemption. The Lamb of God, not the Messiah, is needed for redemption. Man&rsquo;s problem before God is sin, but the Messiah cannot solve the problem of sin; only the Lamb of God can solve this problem. The Lord came to be the Lamb of God to solve man&rsquo;s problem and to remove the barrier of sin between man and God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Spirit was upon the Lord Jesus as a dove. The Lord has the Holy Spirit, and He even is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). He is in the Holy Spirit, and He gives the Holy Spirit to man. When the hidden Triune God is manifested among men, He is expressed through the Son. When the Triune God enters into man and mingles Himself with man, He is experienced as the Spirit. The Spirit is the transfiguration of God, and as the Spirit, God enters into man and mingles Himself with man. As the Lamb, He removed man&rsquo;s sin on the negative side, and through Him as the One who has the dove, man can receive God on the positive side. When a person receives Him as the Lamb of God, his sins are taken away before God, and when a person receives Him as the One who has the dove, he can receive God, experience God, and be filled with God as his enjoyment.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>

<h2 class="head1">JOHN&rsquo;S TESTIMONY BEING<br />
A REVELATION OF THE LAMB AND THE DOVE</h2>
<p>When John the Baptist came out to testify of the Lord Jesus, it was in the midst of a background full of religious concepts. Of all the people around the Lord Jesus, only John the Baptist, who was sent by God, had revelation; everyone else was full of religious concepts based on their religious background in Judaism. All those who came to the Lord Jesus, whether to contact Him, inquire of Him, or even to follow Him, were under the influence of deep religious concepts. These people surrounded the Lord Jesus, and with this religious background, there was a strong religious element in their response to the Lord.</p>
<p>According to their religious concepts, the Jews were expecting a Messiah to come to receive the kingdom and to be a King to restore the nation of Israel. They also were looking for a Prophet to perform miracles, as Moses did to rescue God&rsquo;s people, or to be as powerful as Elijah. At a minimum, they were looking for a great Rabbi, a great Teacher, to come and teach them. However, their most earnest hope was for the Messiah to come and be the King of Israel so that the Israelites might break away from the iron rod of the Roman Empire, escaping from the domination of Rome and obtaining their freedom. When people went to see the Lord Jesus, whether they were leaders in the Jewish religion or lowly people, they were full of these religious expectations.</p>
<p>However, in the midst of this religious atmosphere, John the Baptist&rsquo;s twofold testimony was full of revelation. While everyone was looking for the Messiah, the King of Israel, the Prophet, Elijah, or a Rabbi, John the Baptist cried out, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; (John 1:29). John&rsquo;s testimony differed greatly from the concept of others, who were hoping that the Lord was the Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah. He testified that the Lord Jesus came to the earth to be the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world. Not only so, he also testified, &ldquo;I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him. And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (vv. 32-33). John saw the Holy Spirit descending upon the Lord Jesus as a dove. Therefore, he testified that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God (v. 34), who came to give people the Holy Spirit in order for them to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In John&rsquo;s two simple testimonies, we see two signs&mdash;the Lamb and the dove. The Lamb indicates that Christ takes away our sin, and the dove indicates that He gives us the Holy Spirit. The Lamb of God takes away something negative, whereas the dove imparts something positive. The Lamb takes away our sin, and the dove supplies the Holy Spirit, who is God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAMB AND THE DOVE COVERING<br />
THE ENTIRE REVELATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>John the Baptist&rsquo;s twofold testimony covers matters not only in the Gospel of John but also in John&rsquo;s Epistles, in the other Gospels, and even in the entire New Testament. The entire New Testament speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Lamb with the Spirit as a dove. He is the Lamb, who takes away the sin of the world and thus removes the barrier of sin between man and God. Whenever we speak of the Lamb, we must consider the cross. The story of the Lamb is the story of the cross. Our sins were taken away by the Lamb at the cross. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He solved not only the problem of sin but also the problems related to the world, Satan, the flesh, and the self. All the problems between us and God were solved by the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God on the cross. The New Testament repeatedly, thoroughly, and from many directions speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God, who died on the cross and shed His blood for our redemption, solving all the problems between us and God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the Holy Spirit is not separate from the Lord (Matt. 1:20, Luke 4:1), the Lord gives the Holy Spirit to the believers and baptizes the believers in the Holy Spirit (1 John 3:24; 4:13; John 1:33). Thus, He causes the Holy Spirit to enter into man and causes man to enter into the Holy Spirit. As a result, man is inwardly and outwardly filled with the Holy Spirit, mingled with the Holy Spirit, and fully immersed in the Holy Spirit. When a person is immersed in and mingled with the Holy Spirit in this way, he is mingled with God as one. In the New Testament there are many places that speak of the dove&mdash;the Holy Spirit. If we removed the Lamb, the cross, the blood, the death of Christ, and the Holy Spirit from the New Testament, there would not be much content left. John the Baptist&rsquo;s twofold testimony covers nearly all the testimony of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The original intention of God and the focus of His work in the New Testament age concern His Son being the Lamb with the dove. As the Lamb, He takes away the sin of the world, removes the barrier of sin between God and man, and solves man&rsquo;s problems before God. The Lamb on the cross is a great termination. As the Lamb with the Holy Spirit as a dove, the Lord gives man the Holy Spirit and mingles man with the Holy Spirit. These two aspects of God&rsquo;s work accomplish His eternal desire. This is God&rsquo;s revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING TO BE THE LAMB WITH THE DOVE<br />
BEING BEYOND MAN&rsquo;S RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is beyond man&rsquo;s religious concepts. It is beyond the concepts of those in the Jewish religion of the Old Testament and even among many Christians in the New Testament age. A Christian may appreciate the Lord Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion, including His death on the cross and His shedding of blood for our sins. According to this understanding, however, the Lord Jesus is merely a kind and merciful Savior who delivers sinners from afflictions and rescues them from the lake of fire. The thought that the Lord died on the cross only out of a compassion to rescue condemned sinners from the lake of fire originates from deformed religious concepts. Many genuinely saved Christians have only a religious understanding of the Lord&rsquo;s work of redemption because they do not see clearly that God desires to mingle Himself with man and man with Himself. This desire was in God before man ever sinned.</p>
<p>In order to carry out His intention, God was incarnated and entered into man; the Word became flesh (v. 14). This is a marvelous, extraordinary matter. The Word became flesh and entered into man to fulfill God&rsquo;s original desire, which is to work Himself into man. Hence, there was a genuine man on the earth, and God was tabernacling in Him; the name of this man was Jesus. As the incarnated and tabernacling Word, God came to bring God into man and to bring man into God. This is the purpose of the Word becoming flesh in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In creation man was outside of God, and God was outside of man. This separation increased and, apart from a sacrifice for sin (Heb. 10:12; 9:12), was made irreconcilable because of sin. After the fall, man and God were even enemies (Rom. 5:10), and there was also a barrier between them related to sin, the world, Satan, the flesh, and the self. All these items created an insurmountable distance between man and God. Given this distance, there was no possibility for God and man to be mingled together; God was truly unapproachable. In order to carry out His intention, God Himself came through incarnation in the person of Jesus. He came to bring God into man and man into God. In order to fulfill His purpose, the distance between man and God, created by sin, the world, Satan, the flesh, and the self, had to be eliminated. The first step in eliminating this separation involved the incarnation. The second step involved the Lord Jesus, as the Lamb of God, shedding His blood on the cross and accomplishing an all-inclusive death that terminated sin, the world, Satan, the flesh, and the self. His death eliminated the distance between man and God caused by sin. Then, in His resurrection from the dead, the Lord became the life-giving Spirit to enter into man and to bring man into God. As the Spirit, He brings man into God so that God can be in man and man can be in God. The Lord Jesus spoke of this in John 14, saying, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (v. 20). John also says, &ldquo;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit&rdquo; (1 John 4:13). These words, which are altogether according to God&rsquo;s revelation, cannot be understood by a religious mind.</p>
<p>Our minds are full of religious concepts, especially the thought that the Lord Jesus is merely a kind and merciful Savior who delivers people from afflictions. According to God&rsquo;s revelation, however, we need to see that the Lord dwells in us and we dwell in Him. Hence, we need a change in our concept.</p>
<p>At the time of John the Baptist, Judaism was filled with religious concepts concerning the Messiah, the Prophet, Elijah, a Rabbi, and the King of Israel. The Lord Jesus was indeed the Messiah and the Prophet, and He was also a Rabbi who taught people, and John the Baptist even resembled Elijah. However, those who heard John the Baptist were full of religious concepts, and few saw that the Lord&rsquo;s coming was related to being the Lamb of God with the dove. The Gospel of John shows how the Lord turned His followers from their religious concepts so that they could see Him as the Lamb with the dove.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD TURNING HIS DISCIPLES&rsquo; CONCEPTS<br />
SO THAT THEY WOULD KNOW HIM<br />
AS THE LAMB WITH THE DOVE</h2>
<p>When two of John the Baptist&rsquo;s disciples heard his testimony, they followed the Lord Jesus. One of them was Andrew, Peter&rsquo;s brother, and the other was John (John 1:35-37, 40). Later, Peter and James, John&rsquo;s brother, also followed the Lord (vv. 41-42). Peter, Andrew, James, and John are mentioned first among the names of the twelve disciples in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke (Matt. 10:2; Luke 6:13-14). Peter and Andrew were a pair; James and John were another pair. Philip, who found Nathanael (John 1:43, 45), and Nathanael, who was also called Bartholomew (cf. Matt. 10:3), can be considered as another pair. These were the disciples who first followed the Lord.</p>
<p>When these disciples first met the Lord, they all had religious concepts. Their minds were filled with thoughts concerning the King of Israel and the Messiah. Andrew told Peter, his brother, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah&rdquo; (John 1:41), and Philip said, &ldquo;We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth&rdquo; (v. 45). Nathanael also said to the Lord, &ldquo;You are the King of Israel&rdquo; (v. 49). They spoke these words according to their religious concepts. However, the Lord is not presented in the Gospel of John as the Messiah or the King; rather, He is revealed as the Lamb of God with the Holy Spirit as a dove. The Lord Jesus came to be the Lamb of God in order to shed His blood for man&rsquo;s redemption and reconciliation to God; the Lord Jesus came also to be the dove so that redeemed and reconciled man could receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Beginning in chapter 2, every case that is recorded shows how the Lord Jesus did things contrary to religion so that the disciples would be turned from their religious concepts. In chapter 2 He is not spoken of as the Messiah or the King of Israel but as the One who can change water into wine, death into life (vv. 1-11). In chapter 3, when Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, came to see the Lord Jesus, he addressed the Lord as Rabbi, thinking that the Lord came to be a teacher. However, the Lord Jesus responded, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God...You must be born anew&rdquo; (vv. 5, 7). The Lord also said, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). The Israelites thought that the Lord Jesus came to be the Messiah or a teacher, but the Lord said that He came to be a bronze serpent. He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh (Num. 21:4-9; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>In John 4 the Lord asked a woman for water so that she could receive the living water of life (vv. 6-30). In chapter 5 He enlivened a man who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years, causing him to immediately rise up and walk (vv. 5-9). After doing this, He said, &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life...The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live&rdquo; (vv. 24-25).</p>
<p>In chapter 6 He performed a miracle by feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fish. The Jews who saw it said, &ldquo;This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world&rdquo; (v. 14). Then they tried to take the Lord Jesus by force to make Him King, but the Lord withdrew to a mountain by Himself (v. 15). When they found the Lord Jesus the next day, He said, &ldquo;You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled&rdquo; (v. 26). Then He said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever...He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life...The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (vv. 51, 54, 63). The Lord turned them to see Him as living bread that man can eat in order to live by Him.</p>
<p>In chapter 7 the Jews were celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles. On the last day of the feast, the Lord Jesus stood and cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). In chapter 8 the Lord Jesus was face to face with a sinful woman who was caught in the act of adultery, but He did not condemn her; instead, He empowered her to be freed from her sin (vv. 3-11). In chapter 9 the Lord Jesus anointed a blind man&rsquo;s eyes with clay made of spittle. When the man washed in the pool of Siloam, he came away seeing (vv. 6-7). In chapter 11 Lazarus died and was buried for four days and even smelled (v. 39). The Lord Jesus said only a brief word, &ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&rdquo; (v. 43), and Lazarus was resurrected and came out of the tomb (v. 44). In all these cases, the Lord did not reveal Himself as the King, the Messiah, or the Prophet. Rather, His actions showed His desire to eliminate the distance between man and God by taking away the sin of the world as the Lamb and by giving man the Holy Spirit as the dove. Because the Lord Jesus is the Lamb with the dove, man can receive the Holy Spirit, and God can enter into man and man into God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to be the Lamb of God to die on the cross. Like many of us today, however, none of the disciples understood the Lord&rsquo;s intention. When He was on the road to Jerusalem to be killed, James and John asked Him, &ldquo;Grant to us to sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory&rdquo; (Mark 10:37). Although they had followed the Lord from the beginning of His ministry, they still had a concept that the Lord Jesus came to bring in the kingdom and to be the King of Israel.</p>
<p>On the night that the Lord Jesus was betrayed, He told His disciples that it was time for Him to depart from the world and return to the Father. This filled His disciples with sorrow. Then the Lord Jesus told them not to be disturbed or sorrowful; furthermore, He said, &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you&rdquo; (John 16:7). The Comforter is the Holy Spirit. When the Comforter came, He entered into the disciples, and when the Holy Spirit entered into the disciples, the Lord Jesus entered into them. The Lord told the disciples, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (14:18-20). He also said that in that day their heart would rejoice (16:22). However, at that time the disciples could not receive His word because of their religious concepts concerning the coming Messiah and King. This is the reason that they asked about sitting on His right and on His left. Since they did not understand the preciousness of being in Christ and of Christ being in them, their hearts were filled with sorrow (v. 6).</p>
<p>Even though the disciples did not understand or treasure what the Lord revealed, He still came among the disciples after His resurrection, showing them His pierced side and breathing into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (20:19-22). The Lord&rsquo;s pierced side spoke of Him being the Lamb, and the Lord&rsquo;s breathing into them spoke of Him being the dove. The end of the Gospel of John altogether reveals that the accomplished work of the Lord involves the Lamb with the dove, which the disciples did not understand.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came to the disciples in resurrection in Acts 1, they still asked a question according to their old concept, saying, &ldquo;Lord, are You at this time restoring the kingdom to Israel?&rdquo; (v. 6). Immediately the Lord Jesus interrupted and said, &ldquo;It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set by His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (vv. 7-8). The Lord told them not to ask concerning the restoration of the kingdom of Israel. Rather, He wanted them to know that they would be empowered to be His witnesses, because He had died for them as the Lamb and would come upon them as the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, the disciples received a revelation in the Holy Spirit (2:1-4). On the day of Pentecost, Peter, James, and John no longer spoke of sitting on the Lord&rsquo;s right and left. When they stood and preached, they spoke of the Lord as the Lamb with the dove. When the crowd heard these words and were pricked in their heart, they asked Peter, &ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; (v. 37). Peter&rsquo;s reply did not mention the Messiah or the kingdom of Israel; rather, he said, &ldquo;Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 38). The forgiveness of sins was accomplished by the Lord as the Lamb, and the giving of the gift of the Holy Spirit was accomplished by the Lord as the Lamb with the dove. From the day of Pentecost, the disciples turned from their religious concepts, and they preached, testified, and cried out according to the revelation of the Lamb with the dove. They did not strive for the throne; instead, they were willing to suffer death for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. The first martyr among them was James, the brother of John. This shows that the disciples turned from their religious concepts.</p>
<p>When Peter wrote his Epistles, he did not speak of the Messiah or the kingdom of Israel. Rather, he says that the believers were &ldquo;chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:2). The sprinkling of the Lord&rsquo;s blood refers to the work of the Lamb, and the sanctification of the Spirit refers to the work of the dove. In chapter 2 Peter says, &ldquo;Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness&rdquo; (v. 24). Then in chapter 3 he says, &ldquo;Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit&rdquo; (v. 18). In chapter 4 Peter says, &ldquo;If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you&rdquo; (v. 14). This is Peter&rsquo;s testimony in his last days. All of his speaking is related to the Lord being the Lamb with the dove.</p>
<p>The testimony in the Epistles of the apostle John also clearly speaks of the Lamb and the dove. First John 1:7 says, &ldquo;The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.&rdquo; In chapter 2 he says, &ldquo;If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sin&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). These verses refer to the Lamb. However, in verse 27 John speaks also of the anointing, saying, &ldquo;The anointing which you have received from Him abides in you.&rdquo; This refers to the Holy Spirit, the dove. In 3:24 he says, &ldquo;He who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&rdquo; This also speaks of the dove. In 1 John there is no reference to the Messiah or the kingdom of Israel.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the disciples dropped their religious concepts and received revelation. They saw that the Son of God is the Lamb with the dove, bringing God to man by solving the problem of sin and removing the distance between man and God so that man and God can draw near to each other and God can be wrought into man and man can be wrought into God.</p>
<p>The disciples not only had revelation but they also had experience. The Lord Jesus solved their problem of sin, the Spirit entered into them, and they dwelt in the Holy Spirit, in God. There was no barrier between them and God; they were mingled with God as one. Their problem of sin was solved because of the Lamb, and they received God because of the dove. Their experience was altogether related to the Lamb with the dove, not the Messiah, the King of Israel, or the Prophet. The Lamb delivers man from sin, and the dove enables man to receive God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE LAMB WITH THE DOVE</h2>
<p>Among Christians today, there is still a need for this revelation and light. Few have the realization that the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus on the cross does not emphasize delivering people from the lake of fire but taking away the barrier of sin between man and God. These two views are as far apart as the highest heaven and earth. The first view is not wrong, but it falls short of God&rsquo;s intention. First Peter 2:24 says, &ldquo;Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness.&rdquo; The work of the Lord on the cross does not emphasize delivering people from the lake of fire, but it emphasizes that believers, having died to sins, live to righteousness, which is to draw near to God. As the Lamb, the Lord came to take away the sin of the world, thus eliminating the barrier of sin and the distance between us and God so that we can be mingled with God. Peter does not say that God caused the Righteous to suffer on behalf of the unrighteous so that we could be rescued from the lake of fire. Rather, he says, &ldquo;That He might bring you to God&rdquo; (3:18). We absolutely believe that there is a lake of fire for God&rsquo;s judgment, but the Lord Jesus did not shed His blood on the cross merely to rescue people from the lake of fire. In Christianity today many equate redemption only with deliverance from the lake of fire. This thought is especially strong due to the influence of religious concepts.</p>
<p>The Lord died and resurrected and is now the Spirit in order to enter into man as life so that God and man and man and God can be mingled as one. Man has not merely passed out of death into life but even more is mingled with God. The Lord became a Lamb to eliminate the distance and barrier of sin between man and God; furthermore, He came with a dove so that man can enter into God and also God can enter into man and that man and God and God and man can be mingled as one.</p>
<p>I hope all God&rsquo;s children will truly see that we were saved when we believed in Jesus; however, our understanding of salvation should be based on God&rsquo;s revelation, not on our natural concepts. Salvation means nothing less than God entering into man and man entering into God because the barrier of sin has been taken away. This is God&rsquo;s salvation in the Bible.</p>
<p>If we believe that Jesus is a Savior who gives prosperity and peace, we will be disappointed. Many believers of the Lord do not have much outward peace. The apostle James was killed by the sword (Acts 12:2), John was exiled to the island of Patmos (Rev. 1:9), and Peter was nailed upside down on a cross. Saul persecuted Christians, but after he was saved, he too was put in chains, imprisoned, and eventually martyred for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. James, John, Peter, and Paul were all witnesses of the Lord. The word <em>witness</em> in the original Greek means &ldquo;martyr.&rdquo; To testify for the Lord Jesus is to be a martyr. Hence, receiving outward peace is not the purpose of believing in the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus came to be a Lamb to eliminate the barrier of sin between God and man; furthermore, He came as a dove to work God into man so that man would receive God and live in God. Since the world does not want God, it will oppose those who believe in the Lamb and receive the dove. If the world opposes such ones, where is there hope for outward peace? The only way that we can have peace and prosperity in the world is to compromise with the world and live in darkness. If we stand against the corrupted age, evil, and darkness and if we live for God and the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, it will not be easy for us to have outward peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>The Word became incarnated as a Lamb, and on the cross He eliminated the barrier of sin and the distance between us and God. In resurrection He became the Spirit as a dove to come upon and enter into us who believe in Him. He also brings us into Himself so that we and He, He and we, are mingled as one. Eventually, we will be mingled to such an extent that we do not know anything except God. We will have no expectations of peace and prosperity, nor will our expectations be limited to avoiding the lake of fire and going to heaven. We will know only one thing: God is mingled with us, and we are mingled with God. This will be our joy, peace, and prosperity. Our joy, peace, and prosperity will be God Himself. Some may have regarded John&rsquo;s exile to the island of Patmos as a great misfortune, but it was an honor to John. Some may have regarded Peter&rsquo;s upside-down death on a cross as a great suffering, but it was an unparalleled blessing to Peter. Some may have regarded Paul&rsquo;s imprisonment as a sad ending, but it was a supreme glory to Paul. Religious concepts differ greatly from God&rsquo;s revelation. What people regard as a treasure, Paul regarded as dung. What people regard as suffering, Paul regarded as joy.</p>
<p>Today we need to be like those who followed the Lord after Pentecost and who were delivered by God from their religious concepts. We must be more than nominal Christians, who attend meetings and pray occasionally but who are not much different inwardly from those in the world and those who are religious adherents filled with religious thoughts. Some people preach the gospel, saying, &ldquo;A noble person should not be without a religion. The most noble religion is Christianity. If you believe in Christianity, you will receive peace and prosperity.&rdquo; If a person becomes a &ldquo;believer&rdquo; because he is convinced by this kind of speaking, he will merely be a &ldquo;peace and prosperity believer,&rdquo; not a believer in Christ. Believers in Christ want only Christ. He is the Lamb with the dove. He takes away man&rsquo;s sin so that man can receive God. He causes God to enter into man and man to enter into God so that man and God can be mingled together as one. This is too glorious! In the universe nothing is more glorious than this. This is the Savior in whom Peter, John, James, and Paul believed, and this is the salvation that they received and enjoyed. Our Savior is the Lamb of God with the dove.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>

<p>Although John 1:51 was spoken by the Lord Jesus, His speaking was in reference to Genesis 28:10-12. These verses in Genesis speak of the dream that Jacob had while fleeing from his brother Esau. Jacob &ldquo;dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it&rdquo; (v. 12). Genesis says that the angels of God were ascending and descending on a ladder, but the Gospel of John speaks of the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man. The utterance in these two portions of the Bible is exactly the same except that <em>a ladder</em> is changed to <em>the Son of Man</em> in the Gospel of John. These two portions speak of the same thing. Hence, the ladder in Genesis 28 is the Son of Man in the Gospel of John. The Son of Man is the ladder. It is not easy to understand that the Son of Man is a ladder, nor is it easy to understand that the ladder is the Son of Man. However, by combining these two portions, we can see that the ladder is the Son of Man and that the Son of Man is a ladder in the universe. In this universe there is a man who has become a ladder that reaches to heaven and connects heaven to the earth. In order to understand this matter, we need to read from the beginning of chapter 1.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE<br />
OF JOHN 1</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John is a special book, and it occupies a special position among the four Gospels. The Gospel of John has not only a special topic and a special content; even the utterance is special. In particular, chapter 1 has a strong independent character in comparison to the following chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 begins with eternity past, before time began, and continues until heaven is opened to the earth and the Son of Man is a ladder upon whom the angels of God ascend and descend. Although we have a miniature of this today, its complete fulfillment will be in eternity future. Hence, chapter 1 covers from eternity past to eternity future.</p>
<p>Verse 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; This Word is the Lord Jesus. At the end of chapter 1 the Word is the Son of Man; that is, the Word is a man. He existed in eternity past as the explanation and expression of God, the Word of God, but in eternity future He will also be the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Everything in eternity past was mysterious. Although the Lord was the Word of God, the Word had not yet come forth. He was God&rsquo;s explanation, but He had not yet been manifested. Everything in eternity past was hidden and mysterious; there was only the Triune God. Heaven, earth, man, and time did not exist in eternity past; only God existed. But in eternity future there will also be the Son of Man upon whom the angels of God will ascend and descend. Hence, in eternity future there will be heaven and earth. The angels of God will be in heaven, and man will be on earth. Man is the center of the creatures on earth. In eternity future heaven will be opened and will communicate with man on the earth.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between the beginning and end of chapter 1. At the beginning there is the Word, but at the end there is the Son of Man. At the beginning everything is hidden, abstract, and mysterious, but at the end everything is concrete and manifested. At the beginning only the Triune God exists, but at the end there are heaven, earth, angels, and man. Not only so, heaven is opened to the earth, and the angels are ascending and descending on the Son of Man. This is a very mysterious yet clear picture. At the beginning everything is mysterious, but at the end everything is clear.</p>
<p>The section between the beginning and the end of chapter 1 follows the course of time. The course of time is the time between eternity past, which is the beginning, and eternity future. The first thing that happened in the course of time was that God created all things through the Word. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;All things came into being through Him.&rdquo; The second thing that happened was that the Word came to be life. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; The first thing that took place in the course of time was creation; the second thing that took place was the Word coming to be life and light to man in order to be received. The story in the Old Testament is related to the old creation, but the story in the New Testament is related to the new creation, to the Word coming as life.</p>
<p>When the Lord came to be life, some people rejected Him (v. 11), but others received Him, and &ldquo;as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God&rdquo; (v. 12). Those who receive Him are regenerated and possess God&rsquo;s life. The Word came to be man&rsquo;s life in order for man to receive and gain Him by being born of God to be children of God so that He could raise up a tabernacle among men for God (v. 14). He was raised up as a tabernacle, making it possible for God to be received and touched by man. By receiving God, man receives grace, and by touching God, man touches reality.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John also says that receiving and touching the Lord are for man to enjoy His fullness (v. 16). This fullness is the fullness of God (Col. 1:19). The more we are in Him, the more we will touch the fullness of God and enjoy everything of God. The Lord declares the unapproachable, invisible, and unfathomable God by entering into man so that man can receive, experience, and enjoy all the fullness of God (John 1:18; 1 Tim. 6:16). This declaration is not a matter of teaching doctrine or objective speaking. This is the first half of John 1; it is also the introduction of the entire Gospel of John.</p>
<p>After the introduction we see the religious background and environment of the time. The people were in their religious concepts. Their mind was filled with the Jewish religion concerning the Messiah, Elijah, and the Prophet. John the Baptist, however, testified that the Lord Jesus was not the Leader whom the people were expecting according to their religious concept. He was the Lamb of God and the dove. The Lamb of God takes away our sin, and the dove is for us to receive the Spirit of God and be joined to God.</p>
<p>As soon as John the Baptist testified, some disciples began to follow the Lord. Although they were rather confused, at least five followed the Lord. When they came before Him, they encountered an extraordinary situation that could not be understood or expressed according to their religious background, thought, and concepts. They felt that He was different from an ordinary man because through the Lord they could touch and receive God. According to their religious thought, however, they said, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah&rdquo; (v. 41). They also spoke of the Lord as &ldquo;Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote&rdquo; and as the King of Israel (vv. 45, 49). They said these things according to their Old Testament religious concept. Of those who followed Him, only Nathanael said, &ldquo;You are the Son of God&rdquo; (v. 49). In the Old Testament there are prophecies concerning the Messiah, the Prophet, and Elijah, but there is no word concerning the coming of the Son of God. Incredibly, Nathanael said, &ldquo;You are the Son of God.&rdquo; I believe that he probably heard this word from John the Baptist, who said, &ldquo;He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit. And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God&rdquo; (vv. 33-34). If Nathanael heard this word, it would have left a deep impression on him. Thus, when he saw the Lord, he said, &ldquo;You are the Son of God.&rdquo; Even though this word was full of revelation, Nathanael still added a religious &ldquo;tail&rdquo; to it, because he went on to say that the Lord was the King of Israel. This shows the depth of the disciples&rsquo; religious concepts.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus did not want to be called the King of Israel. In chapter 6 the Jews wanted to make Him a king by force, but the Lord Jesus withdrew (v. 15). It was when He was nailed on the cross that the Roman governor Pilate wrote the charge against Him: &ldquo;THE KING OF THE JEWS&rdquo; (19:19; Mark 15:26). The Gospel of John does not say that the Lord Jesus came to the earth to be the King of Israel. On the contrary, it shows repeatedly that He is the Son of God and also the Son of Man. The Lord said, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner&rdquo; (3:36; 5:19). Thus, the Gospel of John concerns the Son. The Lord Jesus said repeatedly that He is the Son. On one hand, He is the Son of God, and on the other hand, He is the Son of Man. Nathanael was clear, and yet he was confused. He said that the Lord Jesus was the Son of God, but he also said that the Lord Jesus was the King of Israel. This drew out a special response from the Lord, who said, &ldquo;Is it because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree that you believe? You shall see greater things than these...Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man&rdquo; (1:50-51). Nathanael said that the Lord was the Son of God and the King of Israel, but the Lord said that He came to the earth to be the Son of Man and that Nathanael would see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on Him as the Son of Man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SON OF GOD<br />
AND THE SON OF MAN</h2>
<p>Nathanael referred to the Lord as <em>the Son of God,</em> but the Lord Jesus referred to Himself as <em>the Son of Man.</em> These two titles reveal two aspects of the Lord Jesus for satisfying the need of man and the need of God. We need the Son of God, and God needs the Son of Man. From our perspective, we need God; from God&rsquo;s perspective, He needs man. God needs to enter into man in order to be the Son of Man, but man needs to enter into God in order to be a son of God. The Gospel of John says that, on one hand, the Lord Jesus came, and on the other hand, He went (3:17; 14:3). The Lord Jesus came to bring God into man, and He went to bring man into God. He brought God into man because God needs man, and He brought man into God because man needs God. Man is God&rsquo;s need, and God is man&rsquo;s need. Therefore, God wants to be joined to man and to bring man into Himself so that He and man can become one.</p>
<p>In the four Gospels, even though the Lord Jesus told people to believe that He is the Son of God (John 3:16; 9:35), He always stood in the position of the Son of Man (1:51; 5:27). This is marvelous. When He was tempted in the wilderness, the devil said, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread&rdquo; (Matt. 4:3), but He answered, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&rdquo; (v. 4). When He went to Zaccheus&rsquo;s house, He said, &ldquo;The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost&rdquo; (Luke 19:10). When He was judged, the high priest charged, &ldquo;Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (Matt. 26:63). He answered, &ldquo;You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven&rdquo; (v. 64). Although He wants man to believe in Him as the Son of God, He stands firmly in, holds fast to, and does not leave His position as the Son of Man, because as God, He needs man, and as men, we need God. As God, He needs to enter into man, and as man, we need to enter into God. We need the Son of God, but God needs man.</p>
<p>According to the Gospel of John, God entered into man to be the Son of Man and man enters into God to be sons of God. While the Lord Jesus was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, He did not live as the Son of God but as the Son of Man. If He had lived as the Son of God, He would have never become tired, slept, eaten, drunk, or wept. He would have been above all, and He would not have been able to relate to the things in the human life. However, according to the four Gospels, He was not merely the Son of God; He was also the Son of Man. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke speak concerning many aspects of the Lord as a man. Even the Gospel of John, which is concerning the Lord as the God-Savior, says emphatically that the Lord Jesus hungered, thirsted, wept, and washed others&rsquo; feet (4:6-8; 11:35; 13:5). Hence, in the four Gospels He was manifested as the Son of Man.</p>
<p>On one occasion the Lord&rsquo;s divinity could not be concealed, and He was manifested as the Son of God (Matt. 17:2). This can be likened to a cup that is filled with water, which can easily spill over the brim of the cup. When we read the Gospels, we sense that this was the case. Even though the Lord Jesus was outwardly found in fashion as the Son of Man (Phil. 2:8), His inward reality as the Son of God was manifested in Him as a man. The four Gospels show that He was God in man; He was the Son of Man.</p>
<p>God does not want us to be angels in heaven. Consequently, we need to ask whether He wants us to be sons of man or sons of God. If we understand God&rsquo;s salvation and know His way of life, we will see that He wants us, as sons of man, to live as sons of God by the life of God. This can be seen in Galatians 2:20, which says, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.&rdquo; We are sons of man, but God wants us to express the life of the Son of God, just as the Son of Man expressed the life of God on the earth. He was the Son of God, but He lived as the Son of Man.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was the Son of God, but He lived as the Son of Man. This brought God into man. We, the sons of man, should express God as sons of God. This is to bring man into God. The life that the Lord lived on the earth was a testimony of God living in man. We are indeed sons of man, but God wants us to live as sons of God. Such a life testifies that man is in God and that man lives in God. The Lord Jesus is God living in man, and we should be human beings living in God. This is what it means to be a Christian. This is the mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus did not come to be the Messiah, Elijah, the Prophet, or a Rabbi. He came to be a Lamb with a dove in order to bring God into man and to bring man into God, that is, He came as God to live the life of man so that man could live the life of God. In this way, God and man are mingled as one. The result of this mingling is that heaven is opened, and heaven and earth can communicate with each other. This result is signified by the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD AS THE SON OF MAN<br />
BUILDING UP THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<p>If we only had the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 1:51, we would be able to understand that the Son of Man has made communication between heaven and earth possible and even that what is in heaven can be joined to what is on earth. However, if we compare John 1:51 with Genesis 28, we will see that something even greater and deeper is implied by this communication. According to Genesis, the communication between heaven and earth occurs at Bethel, the house of God.</p>
<p>God became a man in order to live the human life. This was God building Himself into man. Man enters into God in order to live the divine life. This is God building man into Himself. Thus, two parties, God and man, are mingled as one and built up as the house of God. This is the significance of Jacob pouring oil on the stone at Bethel. The ladder in Genesis is the Son of Man in the Gospel of John. This ladder is set up on earth and reaches into heaven so that there can be communication between heaven and earth. God can enter into man and man can enter into God because the Lord was incarnated to be the Son of Man.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is indeed a ladder. The purpose of a ladder is to go from a low place to a higher place. Formerly, heaven was heaven and earth was earth. In other words, God could not communicate with man by being joined to man. In his dream Jacob saw a ladder reaching from earth to heaven. This ladder was the means of communication between earth and heaven. He also saw angels ascending and descending on the ladder. According to this picture, what is in heaven is coming down, and what is on earth is going up. In other words, something from God is coming down to man, and something from man is going up to God. According to John 1, the Son of Man is the ladder. He is God becoming a man; the Son of God becoming the Son of Man; and as the Son of Man, He is the ladder that joins heaven and earth. Thus, God can reach man, and man can reach God. On the Son of Man there is not only coming but also going.</p>
<p>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.&rdquo; The Lord is not only life but also the way. No one can come to the Father except through Him. Apart from the Lord, man cannot enter into God, nor is it possible for God to enter into man. The Lord Jesus is the way. God can reach man through Him, and man can reach God through Him. God can communicate with man through Him, and man can communicate with God through Him.</p>
<p>When God is in communication with man and man with God, God and man are built up. When God enters into man, man is built together with God. When man enters into God, God is built together with man. When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he did not mention the ladder; rather, he said, &ldquo;This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven&rdquo; (Gen. 28:17). Then he took the stone that he had used as a pillow and set it up as a pillar, poured oil on top of it, and called the name of that place Bethel, which means &ldquo;house of God&rdquo; (vv. 18-19). He called the name of that place Bethel, the house of God, and he also said that the stone upon which he had poured oil was the house of God (v. 22). The word for <em>house</em> can also be translated as &ldquo;temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stone signifies man, and oil signifies God the Spirit. The oil being poured upon the stone signifies God reaching man. This is incarnation, the Word becoming flesh (John 1:14). The Word is God, and God is Spirit (1:1; 4:24). The stone upon which the oil was poured signifies a man in whom God dwells. This means that there is communication between God and man and that God is being built into man and man is being built into God. The result of this communication is the producing of a building, the temple. God and man are built up together to become Bethel, the house of God.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John speaks of the Lamb with the dove (1:29, 32), not of religious concepts related to the Messiah, the Prophet, or a Rabbi. The Lord Jesus came as the Lamb of God with a dove in order to take away the sins of the world so that man may receive God. His purpose is to bring God into man and to build God into man so that man can enter into God and be built into God. Thus, God and man can be built together to become a temple. In this temple heaven can communicate with earth, and God is joined with man. Through this communication God and man become a mysterious building called Bethel. This is manifested in the Son of God coming to be the Son of Man.</p>
<p>The apostles also expressed this thought when they wrote the Epistles. First Peter 2:5 says that the believers are living stones that are being built up together as a spiritual house. We are stones upon which oil has been poured; we are a group of people upon whom the Spirit of God has been poured. When we are built up, we will become God&rsquo;s dwelling place. First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the house of God. The church is His dwelling place, Bethel, which is built with living stones. In Bethel heaven is open to the earth, and the earth reaches heaven. It is here that God becomes man to live the human life, and man enters into God to live the divine life. This is where the Son of God became the Son of Man, and the sons of man become the sons of God. This is also where God is being built into man, and man is being built into God. This joining, mingling, and building will continue until God and man are fully blent into one, and heaven and earth are indistinguishable. This is Jacob&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to the earth as the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world, and He also gives us the Holy Spirit (John 1:29, 32-33; 3:34). The Lord came not merely to save us from the lake of fire but to bring us into communication with God. Thus, God can live the divine life in us, and we can live the human life in Him; He can build Himself into us and build us into Himself. Hence, heaven can come down to earth, and the earth can reach heaven. Those who experience this can testify and say, &ldquo;We can live a heavenly life on earth and be a heavenly person on earth. Although we live on earth, God can be expressed through us.&rdquo; Such an experience exceeds any religious thought and concept. To merely forsake evil and practice good deeds is far inferior to this revelation.</p>
<p>The Son of Man is our way in the universe. Through Him heaven can reach the earth, and earth can reach heaven. Through Him God can be built into us, and we can be built into God. Then we become persons who not only communicate with God and are joined to Him but are also built together with Him. We become not only stones upon which oil has been poured but also Bethel, the house of God. This is what the Lord Jesus desires to accomplish in His coming as a Lamb with a dove.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>Orthodox Christianity lacks the light concerning the Son of Man coming as a Lamb with a dove. The revelation in the Gospel of John is not related to a shallow religious concept. In eternity past the unlimited God, who dwells in unapproachable light and whom man cannot touch or comprehend, was the Word. In time He came forth as the Word, first in His creation of all things and then by coming as a man. He came forth because He desires to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that man would receive Him and be born of God with the divine life. Those who receive Him can touch and enjoy God, and they can enter into the fullness of God. Furthermore, God can be fully expressed through them.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill this desire, God came as the Lamb to take away man&rsquo;s sin and remove the barrier of sin between God and man. He also came as the dove, the Spirit, so that man can enter into God. He is the mysterious Son of Man in heaven and on earth (3:13). When He was on earth, outwardly the Son of Man was a man but inwardly He was God. This God-man is a ladder in the universe. Through Him God can enter into man and man can enter into God. He brings God into man and builds God into man, and He also brings man into God and builds man into God. Thus, God and man can be joined and built together in Him.</p>
<p>The Son of Man is not only the way in the universe; He is also a building, God&rsquo;s dwelling place (2:19, 21). This is Bethel, God&rsquo;s house. In Him God has rest, and man has a home. He is the gate to heaven on earth. He is awesome! In Him God is expressed, and man can touch God. This should be the situation of the church and of every Christian.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Christianity has deviated and lost these genuine things. Christianity can be likened to a person who has precious gems in his hand but who falls while walking, drops the gems, and is covered with dust and dirt. For two thousand years Christianity has taken one fall after another, and as a result, it has become filthy and has lost all the treasures in the Bible. Everything genuine has been lost, and only dust remains. We do not need to fall anymore. We need to shake off the filth that contaminates us. We need to be delivered from every religious concept. We do not have concepts concerning the Messiah, Elijah, the Prophet, or a Rabbi. Our unique revelation is of the Lamb of God with the dove as the way. He is the mysterious Son of Man who brings God into man and man into God so that heaven can communicate with the earth, and God and man can be joined and built up to become Bethel, the house of God.</p>
<p>This will be the situation in eternity future in the New Jerusalem. Before that day comes, however, the church has a foretaste of the powers of the age to come and can taste the situation of eternity (Heb. 6:5). If our eyes are opened and we receive the vision of what God desires to do in the universe, we will have Bethel among us; that is, we will have communication between heaven and earth, and we will be joined to God. We will have the Son of Man as the ladder through whom God and man can be joined, mingled, and built together to be the house of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FIRST SIGN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 2:1-11; 4:46-54; 11:1-45</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the first sign, the &ldquo;beginning of signs,&rdquo; that the Lord performed (John 2:11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL OF JOHN<br />
BEING NOT ACCORDING TO HISTORY<br />
BUT ACCORDING TO DOCTRINE</h2>
<p>The record of events in the Gospel of John is not according to the sequence of the history of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; life on the earth but according to the sequence of doctrine. The Lord Jesus did many things while He was on earth, but the apostle John chose to write only of cases that portrayed the Lord as life raising people out of death, and he presented these cases according to the sequence of doctrine. The last verse of the Gospel of John says, &ldquo;There are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written&rdquo; (21:25). John selected only some of the Lord&rsquo;s deeds to prove that the Lord Jesus is life to man to enable man to pass out of death into life, thereby accomplishing God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>Hence, the Gospel of John is not a record of history but a record of doctrine. This book shows how the Lord Jesus as the embodiment of God enters into man to be man&rsquo;s life for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to build Himself into man and to build man into Himself so that God and man can become a universal building, which is both God&rsquo;s dwelling place and man&rsquo;s habitation. The Gospel of John presents this truth and revelation, not merely with words of teaching but by presenting a specific sequence of events. Out of the many things that Jesus did, John selected a few and arranged them to prove that the Lord came to be man&rsquo;s life by changing death into life so that God and man can be joined together and built up as one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JOHN 1 BEING AN INTRODUCTION<br />
TO LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>John 1 is an outline and introduction to the Gospel of John. This introduction begins in eternity past and continues into eternity future. In eternity past the Lord was the Word of God; in time He created all things and generated life. Then He took a further step to become man&rsquo;s life; He came as the Lamb with the dove to produce Bethel, the house of God, for the eternal union of God and man and for the communication between heaven and earth. This is the general outline and introduction of the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING LIFE AND RESURRECTION<br />
IN JOHN 2 THROUGH 11</h2>
<p>After the introduction in chapter 1, John presents various cases in chapters 2 through 11. These cases were selected from the many signs that the Lord Jesus performed. The purpose of each case is to show how the Lord is life to man.</p>
<p>The first sign in chapter 2 is of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; changing water into wine. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;This beginning of signs Jesus performed.&rdquo; In principle, this case is the same as the second sign performed by the Lord. In the second sign, a royal official asked the Lord Jesus to heal his sick son who was dying (4:46-54). The Holy Spirit included this simple story in this mysterious book as a further explanation of the first sign. The first record of any matter in the Bible sets forth the principle of that matter. A number of signs are recorded in John 2 through 11, and the first sign sets forth the principle of the following signs. Thus, the significance of the first sign is also the significance of the following signs.</p>
<p>Many Bible expositions say that the sign in John 2:1-11 of the Lord&rsquo;s changing water into wine proves that only He can call the things not being as being; that is, only He can produce something out of nothing. The Lord&rsquo;s meeting Nathanael in chapter 1 proves that He is omniscient and omnipresent. When Nathanael was under the fig tree, the Lord was not only with him but also knew Nathanael&rsquo;s heart and mind (vv. 46-48). Hence, some Bible expositors say that John 1 proves that the Lord Jesus is the omnipresent and omniscient God, and chapter 2 proves that the Lord Jesus is the Creator. Therefore, the Gospel of John proves that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God.</p>
<p>In the past I felt that such speaking was right. Later, I asked the Lord whether the Gospel of John merely proves that He is the Son of God. One day I saw 20:31, which says, &ldquo;These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name.&rdquo; According to this verse, the Gospel of John does not prove merely that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God; it proves that as the Son of God the Lord Jesus wants man to have His life. The Son of God, the embodiment of God, wants to enter into man so that man may have Him as life.</p>
<p>According to the principle of John 20:31, the sign of changing water into wine does not prove that the Lord Jesus is the Creator who calls the things not being as being. Rather, it proves that the Lord Jesus is the Lord of life who changes death into life. Changing water into wine is not a matter of calling the things not being as being but of changing death into life. In this sign water signifies death, and wine signifies life. To change water into wine is to change death into life. This is the first sign in John.</p>
<p>The second sign is the healing of the son of a royal official (4:46-54), and it shows that the Lord can raise people from the dead. The last sign also concerns raising a person from the dead (ch. 11). John&rsquo;s record of the signs performed by the Lord ends in chapter 11. In chapter 12 the Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem in preparation for His death. In chapter 13 He washed the disciples&rsquo; feet. Chapters 14 through 16 contain His departing word, and chapter 17 is His departing prayer. In chapter 18 the Lord was betrayed, in chapter 19 He was crucified, in chapter 20 He resurrected, and in chapter 21 He is in resurrection. There is no record of signs being performed by the Lord in these chapters.</p>
<p>The first sign that the Lord performed is in chapter 2, the second sign is in chapter 4, and the last sign is in chapter 11. It may not be easy to understand the significance of the first sign, but after reading the signs that follow, we can see that the second sign concerns raising a person from death, and the last sign also concerns raising a person from the dead.</p>
<p>The first mention of a matter in the Bible sets forth the principle for that matter. The first sign in the Gospel of John is a sign related to the changing of death into life. This is resurrection. Hence, the following signs also concern resurrection. Although chapter 3 does not speak of a sign, the case here still concerns resurrection. Here the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 14-15). This speaks of passing out of death into life. When the people of Israel offended God in the wilderness, they fell under the judgment of death (Num. 21:4-9). Then God told Moses to lift up a bronze serpent on their behalf for God&rsquo;s judgment so that those who looked at the bronze serpent would live. This type relates to passing out of death into life, and in John 3 the Lord Jesus applied this type to Himself. Hence, when a person under the bondage of sin and death looks at the crucified Christ, he will live. This is to pass out of death into life. Hence, the case recorded in chapter 3 involves the principle of resurrection.</p>
<p>In chapter 4 the Lord Jesus spoke with a thirsty woman concerning living water. The Lord said, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). In the Bible thirst is a precursor of death, and to not thirst forever means to not die forever. Hence, chapter 4 also speaks of the principle of resurrection. The second half of chapter 4 concerns the son of a royal official being healed by resurrection. This is also in the principle of resurrection.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 there is a person who had been sick for thirty-eight years. The Lord Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk&rdquo; (v. 8). Immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Later the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live&rdquo; (v. 25). According to this word, the man who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years was dead in the eyes of God. As a person in death, he heard the voice of the Son of God and was immediately enlivened.</p>
<p>In chapter 6 the Lord is the bread of life to solve the problem of man&rsquo;s inner hunger. Just as thirst is a precursor of death, hunger is also a precursor of death. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst&rdquo; (v. 35). The Lord can satisfy man&rsquo;s hunger, which is an indication of death, and cause man to live forever, because He is the bread of life. This is also in the principle of resurrection.</p>
<p>In chapter 7 the Lord Jesus cried out, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). This word, which was spoken on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles, is in the principle of resurrection.</p>
<p>In chapter 8 the Lord told the people, &ldquo;Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins&rdquo; (v. 24). He also said, &ldquo;If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever&rdquo; (v. 51). These words are in the principle of passing out of death into life.</p>
<p>In chapter 9 the Lord caused the blind man to receive his sight. Seemingly, this is not related to death and resurrection. However, in chapter 10 the Lord said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly. I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep&rdquo; (vv. 10-11). <em>Sheep</em> here refers to the blind man who received his sight in the previous chapter. Hence, the case of the blind man receiving his sight is still in the principle of passing out of death into life.</p>
<p>In chapter 11 the Lord raised Lazarus from the dead (vv. 41-44). This surely is in the principle of resurrection.</p>
<p>All the cases recorded in the Gospel of John in chapters 2 through 11 speak of the principle of resurrection, that is, of passing out of death into life. In every sign a person received the Lord as life and thereby came out of death and entered into resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">CHANGING WATER INTO WINE<br />
BEING THE FIRST SIGN</h2>
<p>We will now look at the important points concerning the sign of changing water into wine in chapter 2. May the Lord open our eyes so that we may understand what He desires to do in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">On the Third Day</h2>
<p>Chapter 2 begins with the words <em>and the third day</em> (v. 1). If we begin reading from chapter 1, we will see that this day was not the third day. In chapter 1 the expression <em>the next day</em> is used at least three times&mdash;in verses 29, 35, and 43. Hence, the day at the beginning of chapter 2 should be at least the fifth day, but instead of saying &ldquo;the fifth day,&rdquo; John says, &ldquo;And the third day.&rdquo; The third day is the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (v. 19). This means that the Lord comes to man in resurrection. Chapter 2 covers two matters, both of which are related to the third day, indicating that the Lord was in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Cana of Galilee</h2>
<p>The first sign took place in Cana of Galilee (v. 1). Galilee was a place in a low condition; it was a place despised by people. <em>Cana</em> in the original language means &ldquo;a land of reeds.&rdquo; Reeds signify weak and fragile people. The Lord came to a place in a low condition, filled with weak and fragile people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Wine in the Wedding Feast</h2>
<p>The Lord came to Cana to attend a wedding feast. In the eyes of the world, marriage is the center of human life. Marriage signifies human life because human life depends on marriage. A wedding feast signifies the pleasure and enjoyment of human life. The primary item in a wedding feast is wine. Whether in ancient times or in the present, wine is always at the center of a wedding feast. If there is no wine, there is no wedding feast. Wine refers to excitement, enthusiasm, and rejoicing on earth. Wine is made from the life juice of grapes; hence, it signifies life. Water in this case signifies death.</p>
<p>Marriage depends on a wedding feast, and a wedding feast depends on wine. This means that the pleasure of human life depends on the life of man. When the life of man runs out, the pleasure and enjoyment of life also end. When the wine in a wedding feast runs out, the pleasure of the feast also ceases. Hence, this sign provides a background showing that the enjoyment of human life depends on man&rsquo;s life and that there is an end to man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Listening to the Lord&rsquo;s Command</h2>
<p>When the wine ran out, Mary the mother of Jesus said to Him, &ldquo;They have no wine&rdquo; (v. 3). Like Martha in chapter 11, the mother of Jesus rushed to take the lead, trying to command the Lord. The Lord refused to respond, saying, &ldquo;Woman, what do I have in this that concerns you?&rdquo; (v. 4). When Mary heard this, she knew that she was wrong. Hence, she stopped and said to the servants, &ldquo;Whatever He says to you, do&rdquo; (v. 5). She realized that this was the Lord&rsquo;s business, not hers. Whatever needed to be done should be initiated by the Lord, not by her.</p>
<p>In chapter 11 the Lord dealt with Martha in the same way. The sisters of Lazarus sent a message to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick&rdquo; (v. 3). But the Lord purposely remained where He was for two more days. His remaining where He was for an extended time was similar to His word to His mother in chapter 2. The Lord rejected and did not answer Mary or Martha&rsquo;s request, because in the matter of the divine life, man is not the lord and cannot give orders. Rather, man must let the Lord of life be the Lord. If we want the Lord Jesus to be our life, we must acknowledge His lordship and give Him that position.</p>
<p>Many people are in death. Within they are full of water, not wine, because they do not know how to stop themselves and are not willing to let the Lord have ground in them. Their prayers seem to be petitions but actually they are commands; that is, they usurp the Lord&rsquo;s position and annul His lordship. If we want the Lord to be our life, we must step down and give place to His authority. We must see that He is the Lord. Instead of answering our prayer, the Lord often allows us to fail because He wants us to learn to stop ourselves. He wants us to learn to say, &ldquo;Lord, I want You to be my life and my Lord. It is a small matter for me to fail, but it is a great matter for You to be my Lord. If You want to let me fail in this matter, I am also willing to fail. I give You full authority over me.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, the Lord will be our life. Once He gains the ground in us by our giving Him the place of authority in us, He will be our life.</p>
<p>When the wine at the wedding feast ran out, Jesus&rsquo; mother should have been full of faith, because the Lord knows everything; time is in His hand, and He cannot be wrong. She did not need to petition or give a command. She needed only to stay in her position and yield to the Lord so that He could bear the responsibility. In order for the Lord to be our life, we must give Him the ground in our being by yielding to Him. If we do not give Him the ground, our prayers will be of no avail. The only thing that avails is to say, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Lord. I give You all the ground in me, and I give You all authority over me so that You can be my life.&rdquo; This is what Mary indicated when she told the servants to do whatever the Lord said. When we pray in such a way, the Lord will do something in us related to life.</p><h2 class="head2">Filling Six Stone Waterpots with Water</h2>
<p>John 2:6-7 says, &ldquo;There were six stone waterpots lying there, according to the Jews&rsquo; rite of purification, holding two or three measures each. Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.&rdquo; The six stone waterpots signify the natural, created man. Man was created on the sixth day, and stone signifies the natural man. The rite of purification refers to moral regulations and ritualistic practices, such as teachings concerning self-cultivation, self-reform, and doing good deeds. The Lord told the servants to fill the waterpots with water. This means that the natural, created man contains only water, that is, death, because water here signifies death. Whatever we practice according to a &ldquo;rite of purification&rdquo; cannot solve our problem of death. Self-cultivation and moral perfection can only improve and educate dead men.</p>
<p>Self-cultivation and self-improvement can be likened to working on a corpse in a mortuary. In a mortuary a dead person is washed and make-up is applied so that he looks clean and nice; nevertheless, he is still dead. I would rather contact a living person who is filthy than a dead person who is clean and beautiful. A dead person has been defiled by death. This problem cannot be solved by any &ldquo;rite of purification.&rdquo; Man cannot change the water in stone waterpots into wine. Everything that is within man is death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Drawing Some Water Out<br />
and the Water Becoming Wine</h2>
<p>In solving the problem of death, the Lord Jesus told the servants to draw some of the water out and take it to the master of the feast (v. 8). This water was changed into wine. This was not a matter of calling the things not being as being but of changing death into life. People may teach morality, talk about love and justice, and seek moral perfection in human life in order to keep some &ldquo;rite of purification,&rdquo; but we must not forget that man is merely a stone waterpot containing the water of death. No matter how purified or well-behaved a person may be, the death in him cannot be changed into life. Only the Lord Jesus who comes to man in resurrection can change our death water into life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK BEING TO RESURRECT, NOT TO HEAL</h2>
<p>Few Christians know that the Lord Jesus has entered into us in order to change our death into life. Most Christians do not see this revelation, this vision. When a person feels that he is proud, he might pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me and make me humble.&rdquo; Such a prayer is according to a &ldquo;rite of purification&rdquo;; it will not change water into wine. A quick brother with an irritable temperament might ask the Lord to have mercy on him and to change his temperament to be one of meekness. However, this is not according to the Lord&rsquo;s salvation; it is according to a religious &ldquo;rite of purification.&rdquo; Another brother may feel that his casual attitude and speech are not proper, so he prays, &ldquo;Lord, please restrict and regulate me by sealing my mouth.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus does not come to answer such prayers. He does not ask us to keep a &ldquo;rite of purification.&rdquo; He wants to change our water into wine, that is, to change our death into life.</p>
<p>The cases of the dying son of the royal official in chapter 4, the man who had been sick for thirty-eight years in chapter 5, and Lazarus in chapter 11 are matters of changing death into life. The Lord does not merely heal man&rsquo;s sickness, which is to alter something; He changes death into life. Being quick and irritable is a sickness, just as being unrestrained, being presumptuous, and talking too much are also sicknesses. In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus did not heal sicknesses. The son of the royal official was sick and about to die (4:47). The Lord said a word, and his sickness was healed. However, the Lord did not say that the son was healed; rather, He said to the royal official, &ldquo;Your son lives&rdquo; (v. 50). The Lord does not make a bad person good; He only turns death into life. Making a bad person good is related to keeping a &ldquo;rite of purification,&rdquo; but changing water into wine is to change death into life.</p>
<p>A saint once said to me, &ldquo;Brother, I am very bad; what should I do?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;If we are merely bad, the Lord Jesus will not heal our badness. We must be dead and then the Lord Jesus will come to resurrect us. When Lazarus was sick, the Lord ignored him. The Lord did not come until Lazarus was dead, buried, and smelling. The Lord did not heal Lazarus&rsquo;s sickness. Rather, He changed death into life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we hate our irritable temperament and ask the Lord to make us gentle, He will not answer. Those who have experience will say that the Lord answers many prayers, but He does not answer prayers related to changing our temperament. Rather, the more we pray, the more we seem to lose our temper, because the Lord does not heal our sickness. He wants us to die so that we can be resurrected. When our eyes are opened, we will see that such prayers are religious prayers according to our own &ldquo;rite of purification.&rdquo; Such prayers do not ask the Lord to be our life or to change our death into life.</p>
<p>Some may say, &ldquo;If this is the case, how should we pray if we are irritable, presumptuous, arrogant, and unrestrained?&rdquo; It is best not to have a religious prayer. Instead of asking Him to do something, we can let Him shine in us. We contain water; we are full of death. Hence, we do not need Him to change our irritability to gentleness or our lack of restraint to good behavior, because the issue would still be water. Rather, we need to hand ourselves over to the Lord. Then He will bear the responsibility to change our death into life. This is a matter of seeing a vision and receiving revelation. We need not ask, beg, or request. We only need to say, &ldquo;Lord, within me is only water, only death.&rdquo; It is sufficient for us to see this. Then whatever people touch in us will be related to life.</p>
<p>The stone waterpots contained water, but wine was drawn out from them. When we give the Lord the ground in our being, we will see death in ourselves, but others will touch life in us. We should not pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am irritable; please make me meek. I am not well behaved; please make me willing to be restricted.&rdquo; Such a prayer is similar to Martha&rsquo;s prayer in chapter 11 and the prayer of Jesus&rsquo; mother in chapter 2. If we pray in this way, the Lord Jesus will say, &ldquo;What do I have in this that concerns you?&rdquo; He will reject such prayers. The more we pray in this way, the less He will move. We may say, &ldquo;Lord, come quickly! I am very sick,&rdquo; but He will say, &ldquo;I will come when you are dead.&rdquo; Just like the stone pots that were filled with water, the Lord always takes us to a place of death.</p>
<p>Some of the saints have reached this place. They have received revelation and seen the vision. They often have the sensation that they are stone waterpots filled with water. It is sufficient to see this. The Lord does not want to improve our situation or change us from being bad to being good. He desires to change the water within us into wine; He wants to change our death into life.</p>
<p>I hope that we will see this revelation, prostrate ourselves before the Lord, and say, &ldquo;Lord, I am a stone waterpot. All that is in me is death.&rdquo; Then the Lord can come to us in resurrection, and He will be responsible for changing our water into wine. He will change our death into life. The more we yield to Him, give Him the ground, acknowledge His authority, stop our activity, and see His salvation, the more thoroughly He will work in us. Then others will touch life in us. This is what the Lord desires to do in us. This is to change death into life. Our Lord has come in resurrection to fragile people in a lowly condition so that He can change death into life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP IN THREE DAYS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 2:13-22</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the Lord&rsquo;s words in John 2:19, which says, &ldquo;In three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; These words refer to the building up of the church in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN<br />
BEING LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>Every book in the Bible has a central thought, and it is very important to touch the central thought of a book when reading the Bible. If we can touch the central thought of a book, we can touch the spirit of the book. The Gospel of John occupies a special place in the Bible because it focuses on life. The Gospel of John reveals that God is manifested as the Word and becomes the Spirit to enter into man. In the first half of the Gospel, God is manifested as the Word, and in the second half, God, as the Spirit, enters into man. The manifestation of God and His entering into man are for Him to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>However, God being manifested as the Word and becoming the Spirit to enter into man as life is not the goal of the Gospel of John. God being life in us is but a procedure to achieve an ultimate goal. This goal is explained in the first two chapters of John. John 1 says that the Word, who is God, became flesh and tabernacled among men (vv. 1, 14). Life is the procedure, and the tabernacle is the goal. God came to be our life so that He might tabernacle in man and among men. The end of chapter 1 speaks of Bethel with a universal ladder that joins earth and heaven (v. 51). This is the house of God that was revealed in Jacob&rsquo;s dream (Gen. 28:16-17). The Lord came as the Lamb with the dove for man to receive Him as life so that He can join earth to heaven for the building up of Bethel, the house of God.</p>
<p>There are two cases in John 2. The first case involves the changing of water into wine, showing that the Lord came to change death into life. The second case involves the cleansing of the temple. After changing water into wine, the Lord cleansed the temple, showing that He changes death into life in order to build up the temple of God.</p>
<p>The link between these two cases are the words <em>the third day</em> and <em>three days.</em> The Lord went to Cana, a place of weak and fragile people, on the third day in order to change death into life, and He also said that He would raise up the temple in three days (vv. 1-11, 19). The words <em>the third day</em> and <em>three days</em> have a special meaning. If we count the days in chapter 1, we see that the Lord went to Cana on the fifth day. However, John records His coming as being on the third day. This shows that in each of these cases the Lord was in resurrection. Resurrection links the two cases in chapter 2. The Lord went in resurrection to weak and fragile people to change death into life, and in resurrection the Lord will build up the temple, the house of God.</p>
<p>John 1 is an introduction, and chapter 2 shows that the Lord Jesus changes death into life for the building up of God&rsquo;s house in resurrection. Chapter 2 concerns the changing of water into wine and the building up of the temple. To change water into wine is a matter of life, but to build up the temple is a matter of building. Hence, this chapter concerns life and building.</p>
<p>The central thought of the Gospel of John is life and building, and the spirit of the Gospel of John is the spirit of life and building. This Gospel speaks of God coming forth as the Word and becoming the Spirit to enter into us as life so that He can gain His building in the universe. This building is the vision that Jacob saw at Bethel. Jacob&rsquo;s vision, however, was not fulfilled until the Gospel of John. The fulfillment of Jacob&rsquo;s dream was realized by God coming forth as the Word and becoming the Spirit so that He could enter into man as life. This is the central thought and the spirit of the Gospel of John. If we do not touch this thought, we cannot enter into the depths of this Gospel.</p>
<p>In chapter 6 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (v. 63). Of the sixty-six books of the Bible, only the Gospel of John speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s words as being spirit and life. This verse shows that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit for life. The Lord&rsquo;s coming forth in the Word and His becoming the Spirit are for Him to be life to us. Moreover, His being life is for the purpose of building Bethel, the tabernacle, as God&rsquo;s house. In 14:2 the Lord speaks of abodes, saying, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes.&rdquo; The Father&rsquo;s house in both chapters 2 and 14 refers to His spiritual building. According to the interpretation in 2:16 and 21, <em>My Father&rsquo;s house</em> refers to the temple, the body of Christ, as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. However, many people mistakenly interpret the Father&rsquo;s house in chapter 14 as a heavenly mansion. Just as the Father&rsquo;s house in chapter 2 does not refer to a heavenly mansion but to His spiritual building, the Father&rsquo;s house in chapter 14 does not refer to a heavenly mansion but to God&rsquo;s mysterious spiritual building. This building is the issue of God building Himself into man and of God building man into Himself so that He becomes man&rsquo;s dwelling place and man becomes His dwelling place.</p>
<p>In 14:2 the Lord said, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes.&rdquo; In verse 23 He said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; These verses speak of abodes.</p>
<p>In chapter 15 the Lord said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you&rdquo; (v. 4). The Gospel of John speaks of the mutual abiding of God and man. Of all the writers of the Bible, only John speaks so clearly concerning God abiding in man and man abiding in God, that is, concerning the mutual abiding of God and man. John speaks of this mutual abiding of God and man not only in his Gospel, but also in his Epistles (1 John 3:24; 4:12-13). In the book of Revelation John writes also of the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God with men (21:2-3). The New Jerusalem has the names of the twelve apostles on its foundations and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on its gates (vv. 14, 12). Those who read the Bible understand this to mean that the city is a spiritual building built up with all the redeemed ones of the Old Testament and the New Testament.</p>
<p>If we see this revelation, we will understand that the central thought of the Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and Revelation is that God has come to be man&rsquo;s life so that He can build those who receive Him and enjoy Him into His eternal habitation. This building is in life, that is, in resurrection. If we do not see this thought, we will not understand John&rsquo;s writings.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF CHANGING DEATH INTO LIFE<br />
BEING TO BUILD UP THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John begins with the Word becoming flesh to be joined and mingled with man for His tabernacling among men (1:14). The Lord is the Lamb of God with the dove in order to take away man&rsquo;s sin so that man may have life, partake of God, and be mingled with God, thus producing the house of God, Bethel (vv. 29, 32, 51). In chapter 2 the Lord did two things related to life and building: He changed water into wine and cleansed the temple. In resurrection the Lord comes to weak and fragile people and changes death into life, and in His resurrection life He builds those who have received His life into the house of God.</p>
<p>In chapters 3 through 11 John presents many cases&mdash;the first case concerns regeneration, and the last case concerns resurrection (3:3-8; 11:43-44)&mdash;to illustrate how the Lord changes death into life. In other words, each case is a matter of &ldquo;changing water into wine.&rdquo; Telling a man to be born again and resurrecting a man out of the tomb, that is, delivering him from the bondage of death, are both related to changing death into life.</p>
<p>Chapters 3 through 11 develop the principle of the changing of water into wine. After chapters 12 and 13, which are a turning point, chapters 14 through 21 focus on the matter of building in resurrection. Chapter 14 begins with the building of the Father&rsquo;s house. In verses 2 and 3 the Lord said, &ldquo;I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; The Lord was in the Father, but the disciples were still apart from the Father. The Lord&rsquo;s going involved His crucifixion, after which He was resurrected, becoming the life-giving Spirit. Since the Lord is now the Spirit, it is possible for us to know that He is in the Father, we are in Him, and He is in us (vv. 16-20). This means that the Lord builds us into the Father. As a result, the Lord and the Father can make an abode with us, and we can abide in the Lord.</p>
<p>We should have this view of the Gospel of John. In this Gospel the Word of God became flesh to be our life, and He is changing death into life in order to build us into God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S BODY BEING THE TEMPLE OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God&rsquo;s house was the tabernacle and the temple, both of which are shadows; they are not the reality. The physical temple went through three stages. In the first stage the temple was built by Solomon and later destroyed by a Babylonian king (1 Kings 6:37-38; 2 Kings 25:8-9). In the second stage the temple was rebuilt by a remnant of Israelites who returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Ezra after seventy years of captivity (Ezra 3:6-13; 6:13-15). In the third stage the temple was enlarged by Herod, a Gentile king, shortly before the birth of the Lord Jesus. In order to please the Jews, Herod spent forty-six years to enlarge the scale of the temple that had been rebuilt during Ezra&rsquo;s time (John 2:20). The tabernacle and the temple, however, are merely types of the universal building of God, which has not been completed. After relating how the Lord changed water into wine, John speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing of the temple. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;His disciples remembered that it was written, &lsquo;The zeal of Your house shall devour Me.&rsquo;&rdquo; This word, which is quoted from Psalm 69:9, shows how desperate the Lord was for the completion of the building of God&rsquo;s house. In John 2:18 the Jews said to Him, &ldquo;What sign do You show us, seeing that You do these things?&rdquo; The Lord Jesus answered, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (v. 19). The Jews were baffled by the Lord&rsquo;s word, and said, &ldquo;This temple was built in forty-six years, and You will raise it up in three days?&rdquo; (v. 20). They did not understand that the Lord was speaking of the temple of His body (v. 21). The Lord&rsquo;s body was the temple of God. Although the Jews crucified the Lord and destroyed His physical body, He raised it up in three days; that is, He was resurrected on the third day. This particular word is beyond human consideration. The temple of God was destroyed on the cross, but the Lord built up the temple in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S PHYSICAL BODY BEING DESTROYED<br />
BUT AN ENLARGED MYSTICAL BODY BEING BUILT UP</h2>
<p>The temple that the Jews destroyed on the cross was the physical body of Jesus. The temple that the Lord built in three days in resurrection was not merely His physical body but an enlarged Body. According to John, Peter, and Paul, when the Lord resurrected from the dead, His believers were included in Him, joined to Him, and mingled with Him (John 14:20; 1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6). One person was killed, but millions were resurrected. One grain of wheat fell into the ground, but many grains were brought forth (John 12:24). The Jews destroyed one person on the cross, but on the third day the Lord Jesus resurrected with countless others who belong to Him and are joined to Him. This resurrected Body is an enlarged mysterious Body. Hence, the temple built by the Lord in resurrection is an enlarged mysterious temple. We are in it; every saved person is a part of it.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Lord resurrected, ascended into heaven, and is seated in heaven; that is, His resurrection is complete. On the other hand, the Lord Jesus is still in the process of resurrection. On the one hand, He raised up the temple in three days in His resurrection. On the other hand, the Lord is still leading the church into resurrection. Hence, the &ldquo;three days&rdquo; that began following the Lord&rsquo;s death and culminated with His resurrection will continue until the day of His return. In this time the Lord Jesus will build up the house of God in resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH PASSING THROUGH<br />
THE PROCESS OF BEING TORN DOWN AND BUILT UP</h2>
<p>Based on the past two thousand years of church history and the biographies of many lovers of the Lord, the church is passing through death and resurrection; that is, the church is being torn down by men but is also being built up by the Lord. People are continually trying to tear down the church, and the Lord is continually building up the church. To tear down the church is to bring the flesh into the church. Thankfully, however, His building-up work is manifested through man&rsquo;s tearing down. Wherever there is a tearing down, there is also the building up.</p>
<p>We are learning to serve the Lord, to follow Him, and to work for Him, and our desire is for the church to be built up. Nevertheless, we have passed through numerous painful experiences. The turmoils in the church have caused much suffering, and sometimes it seems as if not one stone is left upon another. When we inquired of the Lord concerning these things, we received light from God&rsquo;s Word. Now we see that the church is built up in resurrection by passing through the process of tearing down. We must worship the Lord because the tearing down only enables Him to build up the church in resurrection. The Lord said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (2:19). While man&rsquo;s flesh is tearing down the church, resurrection is operating to build it up. While man&rsquo;s opinion is tearing down the church, resurrection is building it up. When we see that the church is being torn down, we become anxious, but God is not anxious. We may say, &ldquo;Lord, the church has been on the earth for two thousand years, why is it still not built up?&rdquo; The Lord may say, &ldquo;In My eyes, two thousand years are not that long; to Me a thousand years are like one day&rdquo; (2 Pet. 3:8). The Lord is continually building up the church.</p>
<p>As the church is going through this process of tearing down and building up, we also are experiencing this same process individually. Sometimes the tearing down begins just when we feel that our condition is good. God&rsquo;s building work is completed in resurrection, but it begins with tearing down. We may feel bad when the tearing down comes, but God does not feel bad; we may be sorrowful, but God is never sorrowful. He will say, &ldquo;I am building through tearing down. I am building in resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without exception, we all want the church to advance, and we want the saints to be in one accord to propagate the gospel and to serve in mutual harmony and coordination. However, our situation is not according to our desire. At times, problems arise among the co-workers, among the elders, or among the saints. There are even problems in our environment and in the world situation. These problems cause the church to be torn down. When we see the tearing down, we may feel sorrowful and wonder why such things happen. But if we see the light in John 2, we will worship the Lord, because the tearing down prepares the ground for building up in resurrection. People will tear down the church, but the Lord will build it up in three days. He builds in resurrection. The work of tearing down is not yet complete, but neither is the work of building. As far as the Lord Jesus is concerned, His physical body has been torn down, and He is now building the church as His Body. For the past two thousand years man has been tearing down the church, but at the same time God has been building the church in resurrection.</p>
<p>Church history shows that the tearing down is often so miserable that everything seems to enter into a tomb. However, after a period of time resurrection brings us out of the tomb. Man cannot destroy God&rsquo;s temple. Man can only tear down outward things; man cannot destroy the inner content of the church. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; The Lord is still building God&rsquo;s house in resurrection. Although man may tear down, the Lord is building. What man tears down is small and physical, but the Lord builds up something that is enlarged and spiritual in resurrection. We do not need to be sorrowful when the church suffers. Rather, we should worship the Lord, and say, &ldquo;Lord, this is the journey of the church. The pathway of the church is one of tearing down and building up. The pathway of the church involves man trying his best to tear down, but You are building up in resurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We cannot build up the church simply by giving messages or by holding conferences and trainings. The building of the church lies in its being torn down again and again so that the Lord can build up in resurrection. Church history shows that this is the Lord&rsquo;s way. After He does a building work and His children are full of expectation, hope, and anticipation, He allows people to do a tearing-down work. When the condition of the church is good and the work is effective, the church often suffers from tearing down. There can be building up only when there is tearing down.</p>
<p>Whatever is natural can be torn down, and only that which is genuine and spiritual can be built up in resurrection. We cannot determine the measure of spirituality in our work. The measure of spirituality will be determined by what is left after our work passes through death. Only something genuine and spiritual will be resurrected after being torn down.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WORD OF COMFORT AND WARNING</h2>
<p>For the past ten years, we have been greatly blessed by the Lord; the brothers are serving and coordinating together in one accord. However, I do not have the assurance that this situation can be maintained. I am concerned that a storm will soon come upon us. I hope that this word will be a warning to us now and a comfort in the future. When a storm comes, we should not use our maneuvering to subdue it, nor should we try to be a peacemaker. Rather, we should let people tear down, even if not one stone is left upon another, because then we will see how much we have been constituted with resurrection. May we receive mercy in this matter so that we would not be those who tear down but those who are torn down. The tearing down will manifest how much of our work and person will pass through in resurrection.</p>
<p>A minister of the word once said that the church does not have a smooth pathway on the earth. This was true in the age of the apostle Paul, and it is true in our age. When Paul was old, Demas abandoned him, having loved the present age, and all who were in Asia turned away from him (2 Tim. 4:10; 1:15). He was left alone. This was a severe tearing down. We would not think that a person such as Paul, who was experienced, who was matured in life, and who had bountiful gifts and great spiritual authority, could fall into such a situation. The church and the believers must pass through this process while on earth. This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s word: &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; The history of the church on the earth speaks of a process of being torn down and being built up. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would not be those who tear down but those who are willing to be torn down. Then, after being torn down, we will be built up in resurrection.</p>
<p>The Lord came to change water into wine and then to build up God&rsquo;s house in resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s work cannot escape the principle of changing water into wine, nor can it avoid passing through the process of being torn down and being built up in resurrection. God will allow turmoils to rise up in the church so that whatever needs to be torn down will be torn down. Those who receive mercy will not take part in the tearing down but, instead, will be willing to be torn down to experience the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. We thank the Lord that He changes death into life. Any tearing down by man will only manifest resurrection.</p></body></html>
