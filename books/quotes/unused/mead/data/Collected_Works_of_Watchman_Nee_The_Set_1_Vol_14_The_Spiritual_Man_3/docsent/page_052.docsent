   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have already seen how our bodies are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the shell is not dead, it is heading toward the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Spiritually speaking, the body is also reckoned dead.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although humanly speaking, the body has life, God regards that life as death because it is full of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"The body is dead because of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, even though the body has strength, we cannot allow it to express its own life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It should not have any action because the actions of its life are nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin is the life of the body, and sin is spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The body is living in a kind of spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the other hand, we know that we should be witnessing for God, serving God, and doing God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All of these need the strength of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the body is dead spiritually and since its life is also dead, what should we do so that our bodies can be used to supply the needs of the spiritual life without utilizing its life of death?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our body is unwilling as well as unable to walk according to the will of the indwelling Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, it opposes and fights with that will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What must the Holy Spirit do in order to enable the body to walk according to His will?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The answer is that the Holy Spirit wants to give life to our mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The One "who raised Jesus from the dead" is God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But God is not mentioned directly; He is referred to as the One "who raised Jesus from the dead" because the emphasis is specifically on God's work of raising up the Lord Jesus from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This draws the attention of the believers to this point: if God raised up the dead body of Jesus, He is able to raise up the mortal bodies of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostle states that if the Spirit of God, namely the Holy Spirit, who is also the Spirit of resurrection, "dwells in you," God will "also give life to your mortal bodies" through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the second time that the apostle used the word "if."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But he was not in doubt about whether the Holy Spirit is within the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 9 he said that those who have partaken of Christ already have the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He meant that since one has the Holy Spirit dwelling in him, his mortal body must receive His life also.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a privilege shared by everyone who has the Holy Spirit dwelling within him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was unwilling for even one believer not to know and draw upon this in faith, thereby losing this portion of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse tells us that if the Spirit of God dwells in us, then God should give life to our mortal bodies through the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This does not refer to the time of resurrection in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This has absolutely nothing to do with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is only making a comparison between the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and our bodies that have now received life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This verse does not speak of the body which has died; if it did, this would be dealing with resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is only speaking of the "mortal" body that has not died, but which will die.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The body of the believers is spiritually dead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is different from saying that it is already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In reality, it is heading toward the tomb and it will die.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as the Holy Spirit dwelling within us is a matter of the present world, the Holy Spirit giving life to our mortal bodies is also an experience of the present world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Neither does this verse speak about our regeneration, because the Holy Spirit is mentioned as giving life to our body, not to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this verse, God tells us that the believers' bodies are privileged to receive life through the Holy Spirit that is dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does not mean that "the body of sin" becomes a holy body, that "the body of our humiliation" becomes a glorious body, or that the "mortal body" becomes an immortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These are impossible in our present life; these things will happen only when the Lord takes us up and our bodies are redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The nature of our body can never be changed during the present life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the Holy Spirit to give life to our body means: 1 if our body has illness, He can cause it to be recovered, and 2 if our body does not have illness, He will preserve us from encountering any illness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In short, the Holy Spirit wants to make our body strong, so that it can meet all the requirements of God's work and living, and so that neither our life nor the kingdom of God will suffer any damage because of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is what God has prepared for all of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But how many believers really have the experience of the Spirit of the Lord giving life to their mortal body every day?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Are not many still influenced by their physical constitution, thus endangering their spiritual life?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not many often fail because of the weakness of their body?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Are they still unable to participate in vigorous work for God because of the bondage of illness?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The experiences of the believers today cannot yet match the provisions of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are many reasons for this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some are ignorant of the provisions which God has put in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some consider that this is impossible because of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some think that this has little to do with them because they do not want it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some know it, believe in it, and want it, but do not present their bodies as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They simply hope that God, through the Holy Spirit, will give them strength so that they can live for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, they also cannot experience it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If believers are really willing to live for God, and if they will claim these promises and provisions by faith, they will see that it is truly a fact that God will fill up the body with life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will have more to say about this later.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 12 says, "So then, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This verse thoroughly speaks about the proper relationship between the believer and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Countless numbers of believers today have fully become the slaves of the body, and countless numbers of them have their spiritual life completely confined in their body!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are like two different people; when they turn within to themselves, they feel that they are very spiritual, very close to God, and very high in their spiritual life, but when they live in the outward flesh, they feel that they are fallen, fleshly, and separated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They obey their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Their bodies seem to be a heavy burden.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once there is a little ailment, they change the way they live.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once there is a little weakness, disease, or pain, they are at a loss; they begin to love and pity themselves and lose all the peace in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this circumstance, it is impossible for them to have a spiritual life.</S>
