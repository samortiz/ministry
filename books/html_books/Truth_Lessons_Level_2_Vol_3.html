This stage begins with God's calling. Then it goes on through the Spirit's sanctification and man's repentance, believing, baptism, union with the processed Triune God, being redeemed, being made a new creation, and being saved. Eventually, it concludes with the clearance of the past. Beginning with this lesson we will go on to see the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of transformation. This stage is composed of freedom from sin, sanctification (mainly dispositional&#151;Rom. 6:19, 22), growth in life, transformation, building up, and maturing.</P><P>In this stage God is freeing us from the dominion of indwelling sin&#151;the law of sin and of death&#151;by the law of the Spirit of life, through the subjective working of the effectiveness of the death of Christ in us (Rom. 6:6-7; 7:16-20; 8:2). God is also sanctifying us by His Holy Spirit (Rom. 15:16) with His holy nature, through His discipline (Heb. 12:10) and His judgment in His own house (1 Pet. 4:17). Moreover, God is causing us to grow in His life (1 Cor. 3:6-7) and is transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6, 17-18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) through the working together of all things (Rom. 8:28). Furthermore, God is building us together into a spiritual house for His dwelling (1 Pet. 2:5; Eph. 2:22), and He is also maturing us in His life (Rev. 14:15) for the completion of His full salvation. In this way we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, the self, the soul (the natural life), and individualism, into maturity in the divine life for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</P><P>In the initial stage of God's salvation we receive the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;and are joined to Him as one. In the progressing stage we need to further experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. From the time we are saved, the Triune God continuously dispenses all that He is with all His divine elements into us for our experience and enjoyment. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." This verse clearly refers to the experience and enjoyment of the Triune God, indicating that we are enjoying God the Father in the love of the Father, that we are enjoying Christ the Son in the grace of the Son, and that we are enjoying the Spirit in the fellowship of the Spirit. The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment (John 1:17; 1 Cor. 15:10), the love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16) as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our experience and enjoyment. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are not three separate matters, but three aspects of one thing, just as the Lord, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods, but three hypostases of the one undivided and indivisible God. The love of God, that is, the love of the Father, is the source; the grace of Christ, that is, the grace of the Son, is the course of the love of God; and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Son with the love of God. As a result, we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</P><P>In the divine dispensing we simultaneously experience and enjoy grace, love, and fellowship. While we are enjoying the fellowship of the Spirit, we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God. The more we live in the fellowship of the Spirit, the more we receive the grace of Christ; the more we receive the grace of Christ, the more we enjoy the love of God. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit issues in the grace of Christ, and in the grace of Christ we receive the love of God. Hence, the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are simultaneously experienced and enjoyed by the believers in the divine dispensing.</P><P>First, we want to see the experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the love of God. What the Father does in His dispensing and in His operating in us is in love and based on love. Love is the source of the Father's dispensing. Hence, when we experience and enjoy the Triune God, we experience and enjoy Him as the Father in the love of God.</P><P>The New Testament clearly tells us that "God is love" (1 John 4:8, 16). Such an expression and similar expressions such as "God is light" (1 John 1:5) and "God is Spirit" (John 4:24) are used not in a metaphoric sense but in a predicative sense. They denote and describe the nature of God. Spirit denotes the nature of God's person; love, the nature of God's essence; and light, the nature of God's expression. Both love and light are related to God as life, which is of the Spirit (Rom. 8:2). God, the Spirit, and life are actually one. God is Spirit and the Spirit is life. Within this life are love and light. When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines on us, it becomes truth.</P><P>In the enjoyment of the Father we enjoy Him mainly in love, which is the nature of His essence. This love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us (Rom. 5:5). The love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16). God has poured out this love in our hearts with the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. This means that deep in our hearts we have the divine essence, that is, God the Father, who is love. Hence, the pouring out of God's love in our hearts is a matter of God's essence. Because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts, we have love as the essence of God in us, and it is in this love that we experience and enjoy God as the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. AS OUR FATHER</H2><P>God regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead (1 Pet. 1:3). This means that God has enlivened us with His life, bringing us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with Him. Hence, in the resurrection of the Lord we have the Father's life and God's nature, just as He has. His Father becomes our Father, and His God becomes our God (John 20:17). Thus we are brought into His position&#151;the position of the Son&#151;before God the Father.</P><P>Galatians 4:6 says, "And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!" God's Son is the embodiment of the divine life (1 John 5:12). Hence, the Spirit of God's Son is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). God gives us His Spirit of life because we are His sons. We have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life. Such a Spirit, the Spirit of the Son of God, is the focus of the blessing of God's promise to Abraham (Gal. 3:14).</P><P>Romans 8:15 says that we who have received a spirit of sonship cry in this spirit, "Abba, Father!" whereas Galatians 4:6 says that the Spirit of God's Son is crying in our hearts, "Abba, Father!" This indicates that our regenerated spirit and the Spirit of God are mingled as one, and that the sonship of God is realized by us through our subjective experience in the depth of our being. Abba is an Aramaic word, and Father is the translation of the Greek word Pater. The putting together of these two terms, Abba and Father, gives a deep, sweet, and very intimate sense. Such a term was first used by the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane while He was praying to the Father (Mark 14:36). The combining of the Aramaic title with the Greek title expresses a strong affection in crying to the Father. Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father.</P><P>The sense we have when we call "Abba, Father" is sweet and intimate. Such a calling involves our emotion as well as our spirit. The Spirit of sonship in our spirit cries "Abba, Father" from our heart. This proves that we have a genuine, bona fide relationship in life with our loving Father. He is our Father and we are His real sons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BEING OVER US, THROUGH US, AND IN US</H2><P>Ephesians 4:6 says, "One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all." All refers to all believers. The Divine Trinity is implied here. Over all refers mainly to the Father, through all to the Son, and in all to the Spirit. God the Father can be in three positions&#151;over all, through all, and in all&#151;because God is triune and even God the Father also is triune. Hence, God the Father has all the positions of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As the Father, He is over all; in the Son He is through all; and as the Spirit, He is in all. This shows us that God the Father is involved with the believers in a triune way. The way He is with us is triune.</P><P>Whenever the Father reaches us, He does not reach us alone, but He comes with the Son. Furthermore, when the Son comes with the Father, the Son is the Spirit. The Father comes in the Son, and the Son as the Spirit comes with the Father. Hence, when the Father comes, the Son and the Spirit also come. When God the Father comes to us, He always comes to us in the Son, who comes to us as the Spirit. The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;comes to us in a threefold, triune way for the divine dispensing.</P><P>When we fellowship with God the Father, we can sense that He is over us, overshadowing us; at the same time, we sense that this loving One is also going through us; and as we continue to fellowship with Him, we sense, even the more, that He dwells in us. His overshadowing us, His going through us, and His dwelling in us are all for the divine dispensing. Therefore, through His overshadowing us, going through us, and indwelling us, God dispenses Himself into us in a triune way. When we experience and enjoy this dispensing, we sense God the Father in three aspects&#151;He is over us, through us, and in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. SEEN BY THE PURE IN HEART</H2><P>The One who is over us, through us, and in us can be seen by us. In Matthew 5:8 the Lord says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." Seeing God is a reward to the pure in heart. This blessing is both for today and for the coming age. To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory (1 Cor. 10:31). If we are pure in heart in seeking God, we will see God.</P><P>Of course, this does not mean that we can see God with our physical eyes. Rather, we see Him with our spirit in a pure and single heart. If we have an open spirit and a pure heart, we will see God. Seeing God is an experience and enjoyment of the Father. When we see Him, He will reveal Himself in us, dispense Himself into us, and infuse Himself into our entire being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. DRAWING NEAR TO THOSE WHO DRAW NEAR TO HIM</H2><P>God the Father not only is seen by the pure in heart but also draws near to those who draw near to Him. James 4:8 says, "Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you." God can be seen, but we need to be pure in heart. Likewise, God desires to draw near to us, but we need to draw near to Him. If we do not draw near to Him, He will not draw near to us in our experience. His drawing near to us hinges on our taking the initiative first to draw near to Him.</P><P>Whenever we draw near to God under the redeeming blood of Christ, we sense that God is near to us. He draws near to us that we may experience and enjoy Him. God shows His love and sympathy toward us by drawing near to us. When He draws near to us, He also comforts us, encourages us, and strengthens us. God the Father is near to those who draw near to Him that He may give them His love, sympathize with them, and comfort, encourage, and strengthen them. Thus, the believers experience and enjoy God as the Father in the love of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. RECEIVING THE WORSHIP<br>WHICH WE RENDER BY HIS SPIRIT</H2><P>God the Father receives the worship which the believers render by His Spirit (Phil. 3:3&#151;here the word serve means "serve in worship"). If we worship God the Father by rituals in a religious way, we will not be able to touch Him. However, whenever we worship Him by the Spirit, we are able to touch Him and are brought out of ourselves into the realm of the heavens. When we worship God the Father by the Spirit of God, He is wrought into our whole being that we may experience and enjoy God the Father, whom we worship by the Spirit of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>The progressing stage of God's full salvation is composed of freedom from sin, sanctification, growth in life, transformation, building up, and maturing. In the initial stage we receive the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151; and are joined to Him as one. In the progressing stage we need to further experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, that is, to enjoy God the Father in the love of the Father, Christ the Son in the grace of the Son, and the Spirit in the fellowship of the Spirit. When we experience and enjoy God the Father in the love of God, we first experience and enjoy God as our Father. God regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ and brought us into a relationship of life with Him. Thus, we have both the Father's life and nature, just as Christ has, and become God's children. Whenever we fellowship with the Father, we can sense that He is over us, overshadowing us; that He is through us, going through us; and that He is dwelling in us. Moreover, God the Father can be seen by us. If we are pure in heart in seeking God, we will see Him, and He will reveal Himself in us, dispense Himself into us, and infuse Himself into our entire being. Furthermore, when we draw near to Him, He will draw near to us in order that He may give us His love, sympathize with us, and comfort, encourage, and strengthen us. At the same time, He also receives the worship which we render by His Spirit that He may be wrought into our whole being for us to experience and enjoy Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly enumerate the items that compose the progressing stage of God's full salvation.</li><li>How do we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the progressing stage of God's full salvation?</li><li>How can we experience and enjoy God as the Father?</li><li>Briefly explain how God the Father is involved with the believers in a triune way.</li><li>How can we believers see God and enjoy His drawing near to us?</li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON TWENTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT<br>OF GOD AS THE FATHER<br>IN THE LOVE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="6"><li>Giving grace to the humble.</li><li>Coming with the Son to us and making an abode with us.</li><li>Abiding in us.</li><li>Transmitting to us the power which He caused to operate in Christ.</li><li>Operating in us.</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>TEXT</H2><P>In the progressing stage of God's full salvation, we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Triune God. First, we touch the experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the love of God. In this lesson we will go on to see other aspects concerning the experience and enjoyment of God as the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. GIVING GRACE TO THE HUMBLE</H2><P>God the Father gives grace, even greater grace, in His love to the humble believers. James 4:6 says, "But He gives greater grace;...`God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.'" Here proud refers to our being proud toward God, and humble refers to our being humble toward God. By being proud toward God, man sides with God's enemy, the devil, causing God to resist man. However, by being humble toward God, being subject to God, the believers withstand, stand against, the devil, causing God to give them grace, as He desires. Hence, we need to draw near to God (4:8) and receive in meekness the implanted word (1:21) that we may receive His greater grace.</P><P>Furthermore, 1 Peter 5:5 says, "God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble." The Greek word rendered resists is a strong word used for an army preparing to resist the enemy. Peter uses this term to show how strong God is in resisting those who are proud. Proud literally means having a show above (others). God resists the one who lifts himself above others and regards himself as better than others. Instead of being proud and having a show of ourselves above others, we should be humble toward God that we may receive the grace given by God. This grace refers to the Triune God Himself as the life supply, which is multiplied in the humble believer. In 1 Peter this grace is called the multiplied grace, the varied grace, and all grace (1:2; 4:10; 5:10). We have received the initial grace, yet this grace needs to be multiplied in us that we may participate in all grace.</P><P>The Greek word for humble also means "lowly." In Matthew 11:29 the Lord said, "I am meek and lowly in heart." To be proud is to have a show above others, whereas to be humble is to not have self-esteem. Instead of uplifting ourselves in the church life, we should always humble ourselves and become lowly. Then we will be in a position to receive the Triune God as our life supply, to receive grace, even the greater grace, the grace that God desires to give to the humble. In the previous lesson we pointed out that in order to see God we need to be pure in heart (Matt. 5:8). That is, being pure in heart is a condition for seeing God. Similarly, in order for God to give us grace, we need to be humble. That is, humility is a condition for us to receive God's giving of grace. If we are truly humble toward God the Father, not having self-esteem but becoming lowly, we will receive His grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. COMING WITH THE SON TO US AND<br>MAKING AN ABODE WITH US</H2><P>God the Father not only gives grace to us but also comes with the Son to us and makes an abode with us. In John 14:23 the Lord said, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him." The Lord shows us here that if we love Him and keep His word, the Father will love us and then the Father with the Son will come to us and make an abode with us. This means that the coming of the Father with the Son makes us His abode and also makes Them our abode. Eventually, this will be a mutual abode for the Triune God to abide in the believers and for the believers to abide in Him.</P><P>The Father alone cannot come to us and make an abode with us. He comes with the Son and by the Spirit to us. We may say that the Father and the Son are distinguished guests and that the Spirit is the guide, the usher. The Spirit ushers the Father and the Son into Their abode in us. Thus, the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;makes His home in us. This is our precious experience and enjoyment of God the Father in the love of the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. ABIDING IN US</H2><P>After coming with the Son to us, the Father abides in us. The Father's intention in coming to us is to abide in us and to be with us forever. First John 3:24 says, "And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him." This is not the keeping of the commandments of the Mosaic law by one's own endeavor and strength; rather, it is the habitual keeping of the Lord's New Testament commandments through the inner operation of the power of the divine life. Thus, we abide in God, and God also abides in us. Our abiding in Him is a condition for His abiding in us (John 15:4). We enjoy His abiding in us by our abiding in Him.</P><P>The second half of 1 John 3:24 says, "We know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us." Also, 4:13 says, "In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit." These two verses show us that because God has given to us of His Spirit, we know that we abide in Him and He in us. The Spirit, whom God has given to dwell in us, is the witness in our spirit (Rom. 8:16), witnessing that we dwell in God and God in us. The indwelling Spirit is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God. By Him we are assured that we and God are one, that we abide in each other, indwelling each other mutually, and are not to be separated.</P><P>First John 4:16 goes on to say, "God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him." This further tells us that our abiding in the love of God is the prerequisite of God's abiding in us. To abide in love is to live a life that loves others habitually with the love that is God Himself, that He may be expressed in us. Furthermore, to abide in God is to live a life that is God Himself as our inward content and outward expression, that we may be absolutely one with Him. In this way God abides in us to be our life inwardly and our living outwardly. Thus He can be one with us practically.</P><P>When God the Father abides in us, we experience and enjoy Him as the God who is love, as the source of love. God the Father comes to us in His love and abides in us that He may dispense Himself into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. TRANSMITTING TO US THE POWER<br>WHICH HE CAUSED TO OPERATE IN CHRIST</H2><P>When God the Father transmits Himself to us, He transmits to us the power which He caused to operate in Christ. Ephesians 1:19-20 say, "And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies." The power of God toward the believers is the surpassingly great power according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ. Therefore, God's power toward us is the same as the power that He caused to operate in Christ. Christ is the Head and we believers are His Body. The Body participates in all the power that the Head experienced.</P><P>First, the power that God caused to operate in Christ raised Christ from the dead. This power has overcome death, the grave, and Hades, where the dead are held. Second, the power that God caused to operate in Christ seated Christ in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come (Eph. 1:21). Third, the power that God caused to operate in Christ has subjected all things under His feet (v. 22a). Christ's being far above all is one thing; His having all things subjected under His feet is another. The former is Christ's transcendency; the latter, the subjection of all things to Him. Fourth, the power that God caused to operate in Christ gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church (v. 22b). Christ's headship over all things is a gift from God to Him. It was through God's surpassingly great power that Christ received the headship in the whole universe. It was as a man, in His humanity with His divinity, that Christ was raised from the dead, was seated in the heavenlies, had all things subjected to Him, and was given to be Head over all things. All these are the issues of God's great power which operated in Christ.</P><P>Therefore, there are four aspects of the great power that operated in Christ: resurrection power, ascending and all-transcending power, subjecting power, and heading-up power. Now God the Father has dispensed this fourfold power to the church, the Body of the Head, in His love. In this dispensing the church shares with Christ all His attainments: the resurrection from the dead, His being seated in His transcendency, the subjection of all things under His feet, and the headship over all things.</P><P>In our experience, the more we fellowship with God the Father and allow Him to abide in us, the more this power will be infused and transmitted into us. We will be strengthened, and we will rise and be lifted up from all kinds of botherings, burdens, depressions, and oppressions. This is our experience and enjoyment of God the Father's dispensing to us the great power that He caused to operate in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. OPERATING IN US</H2><P>Philippians 2:13 says, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." According to the context of this verse, God is operating in us both the willing and the working that our salvation may be carried out, brought to its ultimate conclusion. It is not that we by ourselves carry it out, but it is the issue of God's operating in us. The only thing we need to do is to obey the inner operating God.</P><P>Here the willing is within; the working is without. The willing takes place in our will, indicating that God's operation begins from our spirit and spreads into our mind, emotion, and will. Hence, God's operation must begin from our spirit and spread into our will. The working is the action that takes place in our body, indicating that God's operation not only begins from our spirit and spreads to our will, but it will even more reach our body. Therefore, our entire being&#151;spirit, soul, and body&#151;is under His operation, His direction. This corresponds also with Romans 8, which says that God works and operates from our spirit (v. 4), through our mind (v. 6), and eventually into our physical body (v. 11).</P><P>God operates in us for His good pleasure. God's good pleasure is the good pleasure of His will (Eph. 1:5) that we may have sonship through Jesus Christ and reach the climax of God's supreme salvation. Ephesians 3:20 says that God is "able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us." The power here is God's resurrection power, not His creating power. God's creating power produces the material things in our environment (Rom. 8:28), whereas God's resurrection power accomplishes within our inward being the spiritual things for the church. Strictly, ask or think here does not refer to material things. Rather, it refers to the spiritual things related to the church, such as Christ making His home in our hearts (Eph. 3:17) and the church being filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19). Concerning these spiritual things, we need to think as well as to ask. We might think more than we ask. However, God fulfills not only what we ask for the church but also what we think concerning the church, and God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think.</P><P>When we experience and enjoy God the Father in the love of God, He operates in us to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think. Sometimes His operating is limited by our little faith. But other times, instead of caring for the smallness of our faith, God operates in us above our faith and superabundantly above all that we ask and think.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>God the Father gives grace, even greater grace, in His love to the humble believers. By being proud toward God, man causes God to resist him. However, by being humble toward God, we believers cause God to give us grace as He desires. God the Father also comes with the Son to us and make an abode with us. If we love the Lord and keep His word, the Father with the Son will come to us and make an abode with us. The Father's coming to us to abide in us is the issue of our abiding in Him and in His love. God abides in us to be our life inwardly and our living outwardly. God the Father also transmits to us the power which He operated in Christ. God's power toward us, the believers, is the same as the power that He caused to operate in Christ. God the Father is transmitting this power to the church, the Body of His Son, Christ, the Head. Furthermore, God the Father operates in us that our salvation may be carried out, brought to its ultimate conclusion. He is also able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us, concerning all spiritual things related to the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain the significance of God's giving grace to the humble.</li><li>Briefly state how the Father and the Son come to us and make an abode with us.</li><li>Briefly state the prerequisite of our experience and enjoyment of God's abiding in us.</li><li>What are the different aspects of the great power that God caused to operate in Christ?</li><li>Briefly explain how God operates in us and the issue of His operation.</li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON TWENTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT<br>OF GOD AS THE FATHER<br>IN THE LOVE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="11"><li>Enabling us to live together with Christ by the power of God.</li><li>Reconciling us to God.</li><li>Making us God's righteousness in Christ.</li><li>Sanctifying us.</li><li>Giving life to our mortal body.</li><li>Revealing to us the depths of God.</li><li>Causing us to grow in life.</li><li>Strengthening us into our inner man.</li><li>Making us His poem.</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>TEXT</H2><P>In this lesson we will continue to see some finer points concerning the believers' experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the love of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. ENABLING US TO LIVE TOGETHER WITH CHRIST<br>BY THE POWER OF GOD</H2><P>Second Corinthians 13:4b says that "we will live together with Him [Christ] by the power of God." To accomplish God's redemption, Christ our Savior was willing to be weak in His body that He might be crucified. However, after being resurrected, He lives now by the power of God (v. 4a). We follow the pattern of Christ and are willing also to be weak in the organic union with Him that we may live with Him a crucified life. Thus we can live together with Christ by the power of God.</P><P>It is not by ourselves but by the power of God that we can live together with Christ. The Father's desire from the beginning to the end is to glorify the Son and to magnify the Son. Hence, He comes with the Son to us, the believers, makes an abode with us, and abides in us. Furthermore, He dispenses to us the great power that He operated in Christ, and He also operates in us that we may live together with Christ by His power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. RECONCILING US TO GOD</H2><P>While we were living in our sins, God forgave us of our sins and reconciled us to Himself through Christ's death. This is the reconciliation spoken of in 2 Corinthians 5:19: "God..was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them." This is the first step of our being reconciled to God. Now God desires that we, the believers who have already been reconciled to Him from sin, be reconciled further to Him; that is, that we, the believers who are still living in the natural life, be reconciled to God from the flesh. This is the reconciliation spoken of in verse 20: "We beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God." For this purpose Christ died for us&#151;the persons&#151;that we might live to Him in the resurrection life (vv. 14-15).</P><P>These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle. The first veil is called the screen (Exo. 26:37, lit.). A sinner who was brought to God through the reconciliation of the propitiating blood entered into the Holy Place by passing this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. However, the second veil still separated him from God, who was in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that the sinner might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. We believers were reconciled to God, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place. Yet we still live in the flesh, walking and having our being by the natural way. We need to pass the second veil, which has been rent already and is a type of our flesh (Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:20), to enter into the Holy of Holies to live with God in our spirit. This is a part of the fine work that God the Father is doing in us. He exposes our natural life and unveils our true condition, so that we condemn what we naturally are and apply the cross subjectively to terminate our natural being and become persons in the spirit living before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIII. MAKING US GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS IN CHRIST</H2><P>Second Corinthians 5:21 says, "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him." This word clearly indicates that those who have been brought back to God in the Holy of Holies will experience and enjoy God in the dispensing of the Trinity to the extent that they even become the righteousness of God in Christ. Sin, which came out of the evil one, entered into man through man's fall (Rom. 5:12) and made man not only a sinner but sin itself as an enemy of God under God's judgment. By becoming one with us through being incarnated in the flesh, Christ was made sin on our behalf to be judged by God. Through His death Christ was condemned in the flesh as sin for us by God that we might be one with Him in His resurrection and have an organic union with Him. Thus, we not only have Christ as our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30) and are made righteous before God, but we are also made the righteousness of God in Him, being reconciled to the righteous God, and are made a new creation living to God for His eternal purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIV. SANCTIFYING US</H2><P>In the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the believers also experience and enjoy God the Father as the One who sanctifies them. To be sanctified is to be made holy. In the universe, only God is holy; only He is distinct and different from all other things. He is not common and therefore is undefiled. Such holiness is God's nature; it is an intrinsic characteristic of God's attributes. God the Father sanctifies us not only in our outward position but also in our inward disposition.</P><P>In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father for the believers, saying, "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth." By this we see that the Father sanctifies us by His word. The Father's word carries the reality of the Father with it. When God's word says, "God is light," it carries God as light in it. Hence, God's word is reality, the truth. God's living word works in us, the believers, to separate us from the world and its usurpation unto God and His purpose. This is to be sanctified in God's word, and it changes us not only positionally but also dispositionally in what we are within.</P><P>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, "And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." God not only sanctifies us wholly but also preserves our spirit, soul, and body complete. Wholly is quantitative; complete is qualitative. Quantitatively, God sanctifies us wholly; qualitatively, God preserves us complete, that is, He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect. Through the fall our body was ruined, our soul was contaminated, and our spirit was deadened. In God's full salvation our entire being is saved and made complete and perfect. For this, God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element (Heb. 9:14), our soul from remaining natural and old (Matt. 16:24-26), and our body from the ruin of sin (1 Thes. 4:4; Rom. 6:6). God desires to sanctify us, and He Himself will do it; as long as we are willing to pursue Him as holiness (Heb. 12:14a) and cooperate with Him in this matter, we can be holy as He is holy (1 Pet. 1:15-16).</P><P>By thus sanctifying us, God transforms us in the essence of our spirit, soul, and body, making us wholly like Him in nature. In this way He preserves our spirit, soul, and body wholly complete. God's preserving and His thorough sanctifying will sustain us to have a holy living until we reach maturity. Such a sanctified living is necessary for us to have a church life that is pleasing to God and that expresses Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. GIVING LIFE TO OUR MORTAL BODY</H2><P>Romans 8:11 says, "If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you." Here we see that God the Father gives life to our mortal body through the indwelling Spirit. First, through regeneration this life of God is dispensed into our spirit to make our spirit life (v. 10). Then, through our setting the mind on the spirit, this life saturates our mind for the transformation of our soul, to which our mind belongs, and becomes the life in our soul (v. 6). Eventually, through His Spirit who indwells us, God the Father will give life to our mortal, dying body, causing this life to be the life in our body. This indicates that the life dispensing of God the Father not only takes place in the center of our being but also reaches the circumference, that is, our entire being. The ultimate issue is the transfiguration of our body (Phil. 3:21), the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23).</P><P>If we grow in the life of the Lord and give heed to the inner working of the Father of love, spontaneously our weak, mortal body will be enlivened by the divine life dispensed into us by the Father through His indwelling Spirit. This is not outward, miraculous healing; it is the issue of our allowing the Spirit of God to make His home in us, thus enabling Him to saturate our whole being with God's life and swallow the element of death in our body. Such a dispensing by God the Father will not merely heal our mortal, dying body but also cause it to be enlivened to carry out God's will.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVI. REVEALING TO US THE DEPTHS OF GOD</H2><P>While the Father is operating in the believers, sanctifying them and dispensing life to them, He reveals His deep things to them through the Spirit. Concerning God's wisdom in a mystery, the apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2:9-10, "But as it is written, `Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.' But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God." This shows us that to realize and participate in the deep and hidden things God has ordained and prepared for us requires us not only to believe in Him but also to love Him. To love God means to set our entire being&#151;spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30)&#151;absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life. In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God, and we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets (Psa. 73:25; 25:14). Thus, we not only realize but also experience, enjoy, and fully participate in the deep and hidden things of God.</P><P>The deep and hidden things of God are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God. Christ, the all-inclusive and all- extensive One, is the center of God's economy, the portion given by God to us for our enjoyment. This matter is altogether a mystery to us and surpasses our understanding. But the Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation. When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVII. CAUSING US TO GROW IN LIFE</H2><P>When we experience and enjoy God the Father in the love of the Triune God, He causes us to grow in life. In 1 Corinthians 3:6-7 the apostle Paul said, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth. So then neither is he who plants anything nor he who waters, but God who causes the growth." Here, Paul regarded all the believers in Christ as living plants which need growth. Through regeneration the believers have received the eternal life of God, and this life needs to be cultivated and grow in them. This is accomplished through the planting and watering by the ministers of Christ.</P><P>Planting, watering, and making to grow are all related to the matter of life. The ministers of Christ can only plant and water. Only God can cause the growth. God is dispensed into us through planting, and God's element is added into us through watering. Although planting and watering are necessary, the One who causes the growth is God. Growth does not come from man; it comes altogether from God. As far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ, whether planters or waterers, are nothing; but God is everything. After the planting and the watering, we continuously receive the supply of God's life, and spontaneously God causes us to grow in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XVIII. STRENGTHENING US INTO OUR INNER MAN</H2><P>In Ephesians 3:16-17 the apostle Paul prayed to God the Father for the church, saying, "That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith." First, God the Father's strengthening us into our inner man is according to the riches of His glory. The riches of God's glory are the expressions of God's divine attributes and virtues in many aspects and in different degrees. God the Father strengthens us according to these expressions. Next, He strengthens us through His Spirit. From the time of our regeneration, the Father's Spirit has been in us and with us. The Father strengthens us from within through His indwelling Spirit. Then, He strengthens us with power, the power that raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him at God's right hand in the heavenlies, subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, as spoken of in Ephesians 1:19-22. Now this power is operating in us (3:20), and by this power God is strengthening us for the church. Therefore, it is according to the riches of His glory, through His Spirit, and with power that the Father strengthens us into our inner man.</P><P>The inner man is our spirit, which has been regenerated by God's Spirit (John 3:6), is indwelt by God's Spirit (Rom. 8:11), and is mingled with God's Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). The Father strengthens our whole being into our regenerated spirit that Christ may make His home and settle down in our hearts. As a result, we are filled with Christ unto all the fullness of God. This is a finer work carried out by the Father in us, and it is our deeper experience in the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIX. MAKING US HIS POEM</H2><P>The fine and deep work that God the Father is carrying out within us is also to make us, the believers, His poem. Ephesians 2:10 says, "For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus." The Greek word for masterpiece means something that has been made, a handiwork, or something that has been written or composed as a poem. Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that expresses the maker's wisdom and design is a poem. We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are the loftiest poem expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design.</P><P>The heavens, the earth, and even man, created by God, are not God's masterpiece; but the church, which is the Body of Christ, His fullness (Eph. 1:23), and the universal, corporate new man (2:15), is a masterpiece, a poem. This poem of God is an absolutely new item in the universe, something newly invented by God, because it is the mingling of God and man, and it is produced by the working of God Himself into man and the constituting of man into oneness with Himself.</P><P>According to Ephesians 3:10, the multifarious wisdom of God is made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies through the church. In the coming ages, that is, in the millennium and in eternity, there will be a unique poem, the church, which will express God's wisdom and design. When we are in the New Jerusalem of the new heaven and new earth, we will praise God for the beauty, wisdom, and design displayed in this most wonderful piece of work. The New Jerusalem will become the unique and transcendent poem of God in eternity. If we, the believers, daily experience and enjoy God the Father in the love of God through the dispensing of the Trinity, He will make us such a poem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>When we experience and enjoy God as the Father in the love of the Triune God, He enables us to live together with the crucified and resurrected Christ by the power of God. He also reconciles us to Himself. We are not only reconciled to Him from sin, but we are further reconciled to Him to live before Him in spirit. Moreover, He makes us the righteousness of God in Christ; hence, we are not only righteous, but we have become the righteousness of God. Also, He sanctifies us by His word, which is the truth, and He sanctifies us not only in our outward position but also in our inward disposition, so that our entire being&#151;spirit, soul, and body&#151;may be preserved and made wholly like Him. Furthermore, He gives life to our mortal body that our weak and mortal body may be healed and enlivened by the divine life dispensed into us by the Father's indwelling Spirit. He also reveals to us the depths of God; the Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and reveals them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation. He also causes us to grow in life; His life is continuously dispensed into us through the planting and watering by the ministers of Christ, thereby enabling us to grow in God's life. He also strengthens us into our inner man; this is the issue of God the Father's work in us according to the riches of His glory with power through His Spirit. He will also make us His poem. We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are the loftiest poem expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design. This will be completed and consummated in the New Jerusalem in eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the two steps of God the Father's reconciling us to Himself.</li><li>How does God the Father sanctify our whole being dispositionally?</li><li>Briefly state the process and issue of God's dispensing of life into every part of our whole being.</li><li>What are the depths of God?

ENABLING US TO ENJOY THE GRACE GIVEN BY HIM<br>TO ANNOUNCE THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br>AND THE ECONOMY OF GOD'S MYSTERY</H2><P>Ephesians 3:7-10 shows us that God the Father has given grace to us according to the operation of His power that we may announce to people the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel and enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which was hidden in Him. When God gives grace to us, He dispenses Himself into us, and His dispensing is according to the operation of His power. Because Paul had received God's inner dispensing as grace, he was able to announce the unsearchable riches of Christ and to enlighten all concerning the economy of the mystery hidden in God.</P><P>In verse 7 Paul said, "Of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God which was given to me according to the operation of His power." The grace of God is God Himself, especially as life, partaken of and enjoyed by us. The gift of grace is the ability and function produced out of the enjoyment of the grace of God. Hence, the gift is the ability that comes out of life.</P><P>This gift is given to us according to the operation of God's power. This power is the power of resurrection (Phil. 3:10), which operated within the apostle and operates within all the believers (Eph. 1:19; 3:20). By such an inward, operating power of life, the gift of grace was given to the apostle, that is, produced in him. As members of Christ, we also have God's power operating in us to produce the ability and function that is out of life, so that we are able to announce the riches of Christ and the economy of God's mystery.</P><P>In verse 8 Paul went on to say, "To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel." This indicates that all the saints can receive the same grace as was given to the apostle Paul. As to the ministry of Paul, he was not behind the very chiefest apostles (2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11). Yet, as to the grace he received, he was less than the least of all saints. This implies that all the saints can receive the grace that he received. This is similar to the receiving of the same lifeblood by all the members of our physical body, however small they may be. But the ability (gift) that comes out of the lifeblood differs among the members. All the members of the Body of Christ can have the same grace of life that Paul had, but their gifts differ from one another. These different gifts, however, are for the same thing. The announcing to people of the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel is not for the presentation of doctrines or merely for the teaching of the word in letters. The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness, what He has for us, and what He has accomplished, attained, and obtained for us.</P><P>These riches of Christ are unsearchable and untraceable. We announce to people the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel for the producing of the church as the Body of Christ. In Ephesians 3:9 and 10 Paul went on to say, "And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church." God's mystery is His hidden purpose, which is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Hence, there is the economy (dispensation, plan) of the mystery of God. This mystery was hidden in God throughout the ages, but now the New Testament believers, having been enlightened, are able to see it. When God's chosen people partake of and enjoy the riches of Christ, they are constituted with those riches to be the church, through which God's multifarious wisdom is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies. Hence, the church is God's wise exhibition of all that Christ is. Therefore, God the Father has given grace to us according to the operation of His power, that we may be able to announce to people the unsearchable riches of Christ and to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery hidden in God is, that is, to have the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXI. MAKING US COMPETENT TO BEAR<br>THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW COVENANT</H2><P>When the Father dispenses Himself as grace into us the believers and enables us to announce the all-inclusive Christ and make known to people what is the economy of the mystery hidden in God, He makes us competent to bear the ministry of the new covenant.</P><P>In 2 Corinthians 3:5 Paul says, "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God." The Greek word for sufficient means "competent, qualified, fit, worthy." This shows us that the sufficiency, competency, and qualification for the ministry comes from the living God Himself. This ministry is for God's New Testament economy, which is to dispense Christ into God's chosen people for the building up of Christ's Body. This is not something that man is competent of in himself. We ourselves are of no account, and what we can do is likewise of no account. The Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit has to become our inner constituent. Only then can we be competent to carry out the ministry of the new covenant.</P><P>In 3:6 Paul went on to say, "Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life." Unlike the Mosaic ministry for the Old Testament, the apostolic ministry for the New Testament is not of dead letters but of the living Spirit, who gives life. This Spirit, the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, who became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), imparts the divine life, even God Himself, into the believers and the apostles, making them ministers of a new covenant, the covenant of life. Hence, the ministers of the new covenant are those who are constituted with the Triune God of life by His life-giving Spirit. Therefore, they are competent to bear the ministry of the new covenant.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXII. LEADING US<br>IN THE TRIUMPHAL PROCESSION<br>OF CHRIST AND MANIFESTING THROUGH US<br>THE FRAGRANCE OF CHRIST</H2><P>While we are carrying out the New Testament ministry, God the Father leads us in the triumphal procession of Christ and manifests through us the fragrance of Christ. In 2 Corinthians 2:14-15 Paul said, "But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us in every place. For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing." Here Paul uses the metaphor of a triumphal procession to illustrate how Christ is the victorious General, how Paul and all the believers are His captives, and how God leads the captives of Christ in a triumphal procession to celebrate Christ's victory. In those days, after a victory the general of the Roman army would always lead the captives in a procession through the capital to celebrate his victory. Among them, some incense-bearers were scattering incense as the procession moved on. Some of the conquered enemies were put to death when the procession reached the Capitol. To them the smell of the incense was an odor of death unto death; to the rest who were spared, an odor of life unto life.</P><P>When Christ ascended to the heavens, there was a train of conquered and captured foes celebrating His triumphant ministry. At the same time, however, they were incense-bearers, scattering the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry. They, being permeated with Christ, became a fragrance of Christ. They were not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself was the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God. In those who were being saved, it was a savor out of life unto life, and in those who were perishing, a savor out of death unto death. This is a matter of life and death. Only the captives of God in Christ, who are saturated with Christ by the Spirit, are sufficient and qualified for this.</P><P>Paul and his co-workers' move in their ministry for Christ in the Gentile world was like a triumphal procession going from one place to another under God's leading, scattering the fragrance of Christ. This is the issue of God the Father's dispensing in love. When we continually enjoy the Father's dispensing in the love of God, eventually we will be saturated with Christ and become the fragrance of Christ, and we will scatter such fragrance in our life and work in Christ's triumphal procession for God's satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXIII. HAVING MERCY ON US</H2><P>Paul's experience in Philippians 2 shows us that the Father's having mercy on us is also His dispensing. In verse 25 Paul told the Philippians, "But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your apostle and minister to my need." This indicates that Epaphroditus had an intimate relationship both with the Philippians and with Paul. He was an apostle, a sent one with a commission, to the Philippians; he was also a minister who ministered to Paul's need, because in ministering to Paul's material need, he ministered like a priest. In verses 26 and 27, concerning Epaphroditus Paul said, "Since he longed after you all and was greatly distressed because you heard that he had become sick; for indeed he had become sick, near to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow." Paul did not exercise his gift of healing; rather, he experienced and enjoyed the Father's love in the Father's dispensing. When Epaphroditus was near to death, God had mercy on him and also on Paul. Epaphroditus was healed not by a miracle but by God's mercy. This shows us that Paul and his co-workers were continuously under the dispensing of the loving God. They enjoyed healing as mercy that came from God. If it were not for God's mercy, Epaphroditus would have died. However, through God's mercy he lived, and Paul was able to send him to the Philippians. This mercy is the divine element dispensed into the believers. We all need to experience this kind of mercy that comes from God in His dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXIV. ENCOURAGING AND COMFORTING US<br>THROUGH CHRIST THAT WE MAY BE<br>ABLE TO ENCOURAGE AND COMFORT OTHERS</H2><P>God the Father also encourages and comforts us through Christ that we may be able to encourage and comfort others (2 Cor. 1:4-5; 2 Thes. 2:16-17a). In 2 Corinthians 1:4 Paul said, "Who comforts us in all our affliction that we may be able to comfort those who are in every affliction through the comforting with which we ourselves are comforted by God." This indicates that we must first experience the comfort of God and then we can comfort others with the comfort we have experienced of God. Hence, we must experience God the Father. After we have the experience, we have the necessary spiritual capital with which to comfort others.</P><P>In verse 5 Paul went on to say, "For even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our comfort also abounds." Here, sufferings are not sufferings for Christ, but Christ's own sufferings as shared by His disciples (Matt. 20:22; Phil. 3:10; Col. 1:24; 1 Pet. 4:13). The suffering Christ suffered afflictions for His Body according to God's will. The apostles participated in the sufferings of such a Christ, and through such a Christ they received comfort. Because they experienced the divine riches through Christ, they were able to dispense the Triune God into those who suffered for the Lord's sake that they might be comforted and encouraged. Today we also can enjoy the divine dispensing in the sufferings of Christ as our encouragement and comfort and then dispense the divine riches into those who are in every affliction as their encouragement and comfort.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXV. GUARDING OUR HEARTS<br>AND OUR THOUGHTS IN CHRIST</H2><P>Philippians 4:7 says, "And the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus." This means that the peace of God in Christ is like a guard patrolling before our hearts and thoughts and keeping them that we may be calm and tranquil. This guarding of our hearts and thoughts is the issue of God the Father's dispensing. The peace of God guards our hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus through the divine dispensing. The peace of God is actually God as peace (v. 9), infused into us through our fellowship with Him by prayer, as the counterpoise of troubles and the antidote to anxiety (John 16:33).</P><P>Bad news or difficult situations may cause us to worry or to be anxious. However, we can find the antidote to this anxiety when we pray, practice communion with God, and enjoy the Father's dispensing in the Father's love. Then spontaneously, even unconsciously, the peace of God is transfused into our inner being. This transfused peace becomes the counterpoise of trouble and the antidote to anxiety. Hence, when we enjoy God as our peace, we are made calm within. This surely is the issue of our experience and enjoyment of God the Father in the love of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXVI. CARING FOR OUR NEED</H2><P>God the Father cares for the needs of His children in their living. Matthew 6:31-32 says, "Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things." Since God the Father has created us with a life and a body, surely He will care for the needs of our body. Because we have Him as the One who cares for our needs, we do not need to be anxious about them. He is the source of our supply; hence, we need not be wanting.</P><P>In verse 33 the Lord goes on to tell us that if we desire to have the Father's care, we need to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness. Today the Father's kingdom is the reality of the church life, and the Father's righteousness is Christ who is lived out by God's people. If we seek first the Father's kingdom and the Father's righteousness, not only will His kingdom and His righteousness be given to us, but also all the necessities of our life will be added to us. Hence, whenever He cares for our needs, we experience His dispensing. Actually, what we gain primarily is not His outward supply, but His inward dispensing, that is, His element wrought into us. Thus, we experience His divine dispensing by His caring for our material needs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXVII. NOT ALLOWING US TO BE TEMPTED<br>BEYOND WHAT WE ARE ABLE</H2><P>First Corinthians 10:13 says, "No temptation has taken you except that which is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow that you be tempted beyond what you are able, but will, with the temptation, also make the way out, that you may be able to endure it." Some believers may think that Satan's temptation to them is too strong to be resisted. But Paul points out here that no temptation has taken us except that which is common to man, and that the faithful God will not allow any temptation to befall us beyond what we are able to bear. This is a promise and an encouragement to the believers. When we are tempted, we should never blame God for the temptation. According to the context in this verse, the responsibility for being tempted rests on us. But we may be encouraged by God's word, knowing that when we are being tempted, the faithful God will provide the way out for us so that we may be able to endure it.</P><P>Whenever we are tempted, we may stand on the word of 1 Corinthians 10:13 and say to God the Father, "O Father, You will not allow that I be tempted beyond what I am able, but will, with the temptation, also make the way out, that I may be able to endure it." When we pray to the Father and speak to Him in this way, He knows how much temptation we are able to endure. He will provide a way out for us that we may be able to endure it. This also is our experience and enjoyment of Him in the love of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXVIII. DISCIPLINING US</H2><P>God the Father disciplines us that we may partake of His holiness. Hebrews 12:5-11 tells us that the persecution suffered by the Hebrew believers was a discipline by God the Father on the believers as His true sons. Verse 6 says, "For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives." Since we are sons of God, we all partake of the Father's discipline. Furthermore, we should respect the Father, who disciplines us, and be in subjection in every respect to the Father of spirits and live. The Father disciplines us for our profit that we may partake of His holiness, His holy nature. This is the work of God the Father's dealing with us, His sons, to make us holy. This work of His, which is related to the sanctifying work of the Spirit, is carried out through His divine dispensing in us and through the dealing in the outward environment. Hence, the Father's discipline on us is related to His dispensing. When He disciplines us, He dispenses His holy nature into our entire being. Therefore, we partake of His holiness through this dispensing.</P><P>Verse 11 goes on to tell us that "now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it." The Father's discipline is for holiness, which brings forth righteousness and peace. God's discipline is not only for us to partake of His holiness but also for us to yield the peaceable fruit of righteousness. Holiness is the inward nature, righteousness is the outward behavior, and peace is the fruit of righteousness (Isa. 32:17). God's discipline helps the believers not only to partake of His holiness but also to make them right with both God and man, that in such a situation of righteousness they may enjoy peace as a sweet fruit, a peaceable fruit of righteousness.</P><P>If we have never been permeated inwardly with God's holy nature, we can never have proper righteousness in our outward behavior. First, God works His holy nature into us; then in our outward behavior we shall have the peaceable fruit of righteousness as the issue of the inward holiness. Hence, we have holiness, righteousness, and peace in the Father's discipline in love by His divine dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>When we experience and enjoy God as the Father in the love of God, God the Father gives grace to us according to the operation of His power, that we may announce to people the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel and enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which was hidden in Him. Thus, He makes us competent to bear the ministry of the new covenant, in which we dispense Christ into people for the building up of Christ's Body. While we are thus carrying out the New Testament ministry, God the Father leads us in the triumphal procession of Christ and manifests through us the fragrance of Christ. God the Father also has mercy on us in that He heals our body by working His divine element into us. Furthermore, He encourages and comforts us through Christ that we may encourage and comfort others; we participate in Christ's sufferings and experience the divine riches through Christ, so that we are able to dispense the Triune God into those who suffer for the Lord that they may be comforted and encouraged. God the Father also guards our hearts and thoughts in Christ by the peace of God, which surpasses our understanding, as the counterpoise of troubles and the antidote to anxiety. He also cares for the needs in our living so that we do not need to be anxious about them. We need first to seek His kingdom and His righteousness; then His kingdom and His righteousness with all the necessities of our life will be added to us. He also will not allow that we be tempted beyond what we are able, but will make a way out, that we may be able to endure. He also disciplines us as sons to dispense His holy nature into our entire being that we may partake of His holiness and yield the peaceable fruit of righteousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Explain briefly how we can announce the riches of Christ and the economy of God's mystery.</li><li>How does God make us competent to bear the ministry of the new covenant?</li><li>State briefly how God the Father makes us those who are able to encourage and comfort others.</li><li>Explain briefly how God guards our hearts and thoughts in Christ.</li><li>How do we experience God's making a way out for us when we are being tempted?</li><li>State briefly the purpose of God the Father's discipline over us.</li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON TWENTY-NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT<br>OF GOD AS THE FATHER<br>IN THE LOVE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman" start="29"><li>Guarding us from stumbling and causing us to be without blemish.</li><li>Judging us.</li><li>Crushing Satan under our feet.</li><li>Answering our cry and avenging us.</li><li>Fulfilling in power our every good intention for goodness and our work of faith.</li><li>Perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding us.</li><li>Raising us and making us stand before Him.</li><li>Having wrought us that our mortal body may be swallowed up by life.</li><li>Making us His inheritance of glory.</li><li>Leading us as His many sons into glory.</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TEXT</H2><P>In this lesson we will go on to see the remaining aspects of the believers' experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the love of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXIX. GUARDING US FROM STUMBLING<br>AND CAUSING US TO BE WITHOUT BLEMISH</H2><P>Jude 24 tells us that God is able to guard us from stumbling and to set us before His glory without blemish in exultation. This verse clearly indicates that although the believers are charged in the preceding verses to build up themselves upon the faith, to keep themselves in the love of God, and to have mercy on and save those who are wavering, only God our Savior is able to guard them from stumbling and cause them to be without blemish, that is, to have no other element as a mixture besides the holy nature of God. The more we are saturated with the Father by experiencing and enjoying His divine dispensing, the more we are guarded from stumbling and are delivered from our natural, human elements, from our flesh, from our self, and from the things of the world, so that we may be set before His glory without blemish in exultation at the Lord's coming.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXX. JUDGING US</H2><P>In order to make us holy that we may be without blemish, God not only disciplines us but also judges us. First Peter 4:17 says, "For it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?" First Peter is concerned with the Christian life under the government of God. God's government is universal, and in His governing He judges all His created things so that He may have a clean and purified universe (2 Pet. 3:13) for His expression. In the New Testament age, this judgment begins from His chosen people, His own household. According to the context of this verse, the sufferings the believers undergo in fiery persecution are used by God as a means to judge them that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from the unbelievers and not have the same destiny as they. Hence, such disciplinary judgment begins from God's own household, and it is not exercised just once or twice but is being carried out continuously until the Lord's coming.</P><P>The judgment in 1 Peter 4:17 is not for condemnation to eternal perdition; it is judgment for discipline, a discipline in this age to purify our life. This judgment is a fiery ordeal, a burning furnace (v. 12), to purify us and remove any dross. We can be compared to gold, but we still have a certain amount of dross from which we need to be purified. No teaching or fellowship can accomplish this purification. The disciplinary judgment of the burning furnace is necessary to carry it out. Hence, God puts us into a burning furnace, into fiery ordeals, to burn away our dross that our life may be purified. Thus, we may be saved through the difficulty of persecution from God's destruction of the world. This is the way God exercises judgment on the believers in His governmental administration. On the one hand, God is gracing us that we may live a life that suits His righteousness under His government. On the other hand, through discipline He judges anything that does not match His government. Therefore, today we believers are under the daily judgment of God. When we are under God's judgment, we also enjoy His dispensing in His love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXI. CRUSHING SATAN UNDER OUR FEET</H2><P>Romans 16:20 says, "Now the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly." This word of God's promise is spoken to those who are in the church life, because the preceding verses show the concern between the saints and the fellowship among the churches. Dealing with Satan is a Body matter, not an individual matter. It is only when we experience and enjoy the divine dispensing in the church life that we can overcome Satan and crush him under our feet. The church life is the strongest means by which God overcomes Satan, and it is also the secret of our victory. Whenever we are separated from the church, we become a prey for Satan, for it is impossible for us to fight Satan individually. But as long as we remain in the church and are one with the Body, Satan is under our feet, and we also enjoy God as the God of peace.</P><P>God's crushing of Satan under our feet is not merely by the church, the Body of Christ, but also by the life that is in the Body. In this matter, the Body and life are equally important. Life is nothing less than the Triune God dispensed into us to constitute us the Body of Christ. Hence, life and the Body are one; they are inseparable. If there is no life, then there can be no Body. Life is the content, and the Body is the expression. God will crush Satan under our feet through life and the Body.</P><P>Here Paul calls God "the God of peace." This is very significant. The God of peace and the peace of God are one. Whenever God is dispensed into us, peace is dispensed into us. Hence, the true peace that we enjoy is God Himself. When God crushes Satan under our feet in the church life, we have the peace of God as a token of our victory. Thus, through the divine dispensing we experience the crushing of Satan and the peace of God in the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXII. ANSWERING OUR CRY AND AVENGING US</H2><P>We can also experience and enjoy God as the Father in God's love by God's answering our cry and avenging us. This matter is shown in Luke 18:1-8 in the parable in which the Lord taught the disciples concerning persistent prayer. The widow signifies the believers. The believers are a widow in the present age because their Husband, Christ, is absent from them. The believers also have an opponent, that is, Satan the devil, concerning whom they need God's avenging.</P><P>This parable indicates that during the Lord's apparent absence, we, the believers (a widow) in Christ, suffer because our opponent Satan is troubling us all the time. Furthermore, while we are suffering persecution, it seems that our God is not righteous, for He allows His children to be unrighteously persecuted. Throughout the centuries, thousands upon thousands of faithful followers of the Lord have suffered unrighteous persecution. Even today we are still undergoing unrighteous mistreatment, yet God does not come in immediately to judge and vindicate. Even so, we still must appeal to Him, pray persistently, bother Him again and again, and not lose heart. Eventually, He will answer our cry and avenge us. "And will not God by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night, though He is long-suffering over them? I tell you that He will carry out their avenging quickly" (vv. 7-8a).</P><P>On the one hand, this parable indicates that the Judge, the righteous God, is the sovereign Lord, who has the right to decide when He will avenge us and when He will execute His judgment. On the other hand, this parable indicates that we need to bother the Lord by praying persistently until He answers our cry and avenges us. In the process of His answering our cry and avenging us of our enemy, God dispenses Himself into us that we may experience and enjoy Him in His love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXIII. FULFILLING IN POWER<br>OUR EVERY GOOD INTENTION FOR GOODNESS<br>AND OUR WORK OF FAITH</H2><P>In 2 Thessalonians 1:11 the apostle Paul prayed for the believers, saying "that our God may count you worthy of your calling and may fulfill in power your every good intention for goodness and your work of faith." We, the believers in Christ, have been made a new creation by God for good works, that is, for doing the will of God. These good works not only were preplanned and foreordained by God for us to walk in (Eph. 2:10; Titus 2:14; 1 Pet. 2:15), but they are our good intention, our delight&#151;we are happy to do them. Furthermore, by the infusion of what God is, our faith in God grows and issues in a proper Christian walk and work. However, although we have the good intention, the delight, for goodness and the walk and work of faith, without the power of God, we do not have the ability to accomplish what we are glad to do. When we live in the love of God and enjoy the divine dispensing, God will fulfill in His power our every good intention and our work. The operating power of God not only works in us and strengthens us but also creates the outward environment needed for the fulfillment of our every good intention for goodness and our work of faith.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXIV. PERFECTING, ESTABLISHING,<br>STRENGTHENING, AND GROUNDING US</H2><P>First Peter 5:10 says, "But the God of all grace, He who has called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you." All grace in this verse refers to the riches of the bountiful supply of the divine life in many aspects ministered to us in many steps of the divine operation on and in us in God's economy. The initial step is to call us, and the consummate step is to glorify us. Between these two steps are God's loving care while He is disciplining us, and His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work in us. In all these divine acts, the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences. Through such dispensing God enables us to attain His glorious goal.</P><P>Here we see that there is a progression in the four divine acts of God's grace. Perfecting leads to establishing, establishing to strengthening, and strengthening to grounding in the God of all grace. First, God perfects us, perhaps through the suffering of persecution or through different kinds of environments, that we may be restored, put in order again, equipped, and edified. Then God establishes us that we may be set fast, confirmed, and that we may no longer wander and may no longer be changeable. After this, God strengthens us, empowers us, and eventually He grounds us solidly in Himself. Thus, He as the God of all grace and as the solid foundation enables us to gradually attain the consummate goal of His eternal glory, into which we have been called. What a miracle that fallen sinners could be brought into God's eternal glory! And how excellent is His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work in us!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXV. RAISING US AND<br>MAKING US STAND BEFORE HIM</H2><P>Through the divine dispensing God also raises the believers and makes them stand before Him. In 2 Corinthians 4:14 Paul says, "Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will make us stand before Him with you." This indicates that the apostles considered themselves dead persons (1:9), for they were always being delivered unto death for the Lord's purpose (4:11). Their only hope was in God, who raised the Lord Jesus and who would raise them also. It was by such faith that they lived.</P><P>In 2 Corinthians 1:9 Paul confirmed the apostles' experience of resurrection by God: "Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead." When the apostles were under the pressure of affliction, despairing even of life, they might have asked themselves what the issue of their suffering would be. The answer or response was "death." This led them to the vital decision not to base their confidence on themselves but on God, who raises the dead. This shows us that the experience of death always ushers us into the experience of resurrection. When we are in all kinds of afflictions, passing through sufferings, pressures, and the killing work of the cross, our self is terminated that we may experience and enjoy God in resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXVI. HAVING WROUGHT US THAT OUR MORTAL BODY<br>MAY BE SWALLOWED UP BY LIFE</H2><P>In 2 Corinthians 5:4-5 Paul said, "For also, we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, in that we do not desire to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God." What is mortal here denotes our mortal body (4:11; Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 15:53). The apostles were expecting to be transfigured in their body, to be clothed with a spiritual body to meet the Lord before they died and were disembodied. Their spirit was regenerated and their soul was transformed, but their body was not yet fully redeemed. They were still living in their dying, physical, and natural body; hence, being burdened, they groaned. However, the apostles did not desire to be unclothed, disembodied, that is, to die, but to be clothed upon, to put on the resurrected, spiritual, and heavenly body, that is, to have their body transfigured and redeemed (Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:23). At that time the death in their mortal body will be swallowed up by the resurrection life.</P><P>The transfiguration of our body, the swallowing up by life of what is mortal, is the ultimate consummation of God's full salvation. In order to accomplish this, God has wrought us and is still doing this work in us continually. The Greek word for wrought may also be rendered fashioned, shaped, prepared, made fit. By dispensing Himself into us God has wrought us, fashioned us, shaped us, prepared us, made us fit, for the very purpose that our mortal body might be swallowed up by His resurrection life. Today He is already in our spirit and is continually spreading to our soul, and then from our soul He will spread to our body. Then one day He will saturate our body and swallow up the element of death in our body. Thus, the body of our humiliation will be transfigured and conformed to the body of Christ's glory (Phil. 3:21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXVII. MAKING US<br>HIS INHERITANCE OF GLORY</H2><P>As we believers continually enjoy the divine dispensing of God in His love, eventually our entire being&#151;spirit, soul, and body&#151;will be saturated and possessed by Him and become His inheritance of glory. Ephesians 1:18 speaks of "what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints." We, the saints, are God's inheritance. This does not refer to what we are by nature. Rather, it refers to all that He has dispensed into us of Himself. Whatever God has dispensed of Himself into us becomes His inheritance.</P><P>What God desires to inherit in the saints is of glory, and this glory has its riches. These riches are the many different items of God's divine attributes, such as light, life, power, love, righteousness, and holiness, expressed in different degrees. God first made us His inheritance (Eph. 1:11) as His acquired possession (v. 14b) and gave us to participate in all that He is, all that He has, and all that He has accomplished, as our inheritance. Ultimately, all these will become His inheritance in the saints for eternity. This will be His eternal expression, His glory with all His riches, which will express Him to the uttermost universally and eternally (Rev. 21:11).</P><P>Ephesians 1:11 says, "In whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will." The Greek verb for were designated as an inheritance in this verse means "to choose or assign by lot." Hence, this clause literally means that in Christ we were designated as a chosen inheritance. We were designated as an inheritance to inherit God as our inheritance. On the one hand, we have become God's inheritance for God's enjoyment; on the other hand, we inherit God as our inheritance for our enjoyment. According to what we are by nature, we are not worth anything; but because we are in Christ and God has been wrought into us through the divine dispensing, we have been constituted into God's inheritance. Now we are in the process of being designated God's inheritance in full, and God is in the process of dispensing Himself into us little by little. If God is not dispensed into us and wrought into us, we cannot become His inheritance. We become precious to Him by being saturated with the divine essence. Only in this way can poor sinners become God's peculiar treasure. In this universe God is the only One who is precious. Now this precious God of matchless worth is dispensing Himself into us to make us His inheritance of glory.</P><P>From the time we were saved, God has been working in us to dispense Himself into us as our inheritance for our enjoyment. The more we enjoy Him and participate in Him, the more He dispenses what He is into our entire being. As a result, more and more we become His inheritance, and we also express more of His glory. Eventually, we will be fully saturated with Him and constituted of Him to become His inheritance for His enjoyment. This will consummate in the New Jerusalem in eternity, a mutual dwelling place for God and His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people, in which we will enjoy the Triune God as our eternal inheritance, and He also will enjoy us as His eternal inheritance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXXVIII. LEADING US AS HIS MANY SONS INTO GLORY</H2><P>The final issue of our experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in love is that we believers will be led into glory. Hebrews 2:10 tells us that God is "leading many sons into glory." This is the last step of God's full salvation. Romans 8 shows us that God's work of grace upon us began with His foreknowing, passed through His predestination, calling, and justification, and will end with His glorification (vv. 29-30). Also, Romans 8 tells us that the whole creation eagerly awaits the revelation (glorification) of the sons of God, in hope that the creation itself will enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (vv. 19-21). This will be accomplished by the Lord's coming back (Phil. 3:21), at which time we will be manifested with Him in glory (Col. 3:4); this is our hope (1:27). This glorification of the sons of God, as the goal of God's salvation, will last through the millennial kingdom and will be manifested in full in the New Jerusalem for eternity (Rev. 21:11, 23).</P><P>God's leading us, the believers, as His many sons into glory will be the ultimate consummation of the divine dispensing. This means that God's dispensing will consummate in His bringing us as His many sons into His glory. Therefore, it is only by the divine dispensing that we will be constituted into God's inheritance and brought into God's glory. Through regeneration God's life of glory has been dispensed into us as a seed of glory in us. This seed, the divine life of glory, is Christ in us, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). Now, through the divine dispensing, it is continually growing and developing until it blossoms. When it blossoms, that will be the time of our glorification. Today we participate in God the Father's dispensing to experience and enjoy Him daily, and in that day we will enter into His glory and reach the goal of God's salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>In His divine dispensing God the Father guards us from stumbling and sets us before His glory without blemish in exultation at the Lord's coming. He also judges us that by undergoing suffering in fiery persecution we may be disciplined, purified, and separated from the unbelievers and not have the same destiny as they. God also promises us who are in the church life that He will crush Satan under our feet and that we will enjoy God as the God of peace. Furthermore, by our persistent prayer we compel God to answer our cry and avenge us of our enemy, Satan. Moreover, God will fulfill our every good intention for goodness and our work of faith in power. Meanwhile, He perfects, establishes, strengthens, and grounds us in Him by the suffering of persecution and different kinds of environment. Although we are always being delivered unto death for the Lord's purpose, God will raise us and cause us to stand before Him through His divine dispensing. Today, being burdened, we groan, because we are still living in our dying, physical, and natural body, yet God has wrought and prepared us by dispensing Himself into us that our mortal body might be swallowed up by His resurrection life. By continually enjoying God's divine dispensing in His love, our whole being&#151;spirit, soul, and body&#151;will be completely saturated with Him and constituted of Him to become His inheritance of glory for His enjoyment. Eventually, God will lead us as His many sons into His divine glory. This is the ultimate goal of God's salvation; it will last through the millennial kingdom and will be fully manifested in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Why does God judge the believers?</li><li>Briefly explain how God will crush Satan under our feet.</li><li>How do we experience God's answering our cry and His avenging us?</li><li>Briefly explain the meaning of God's perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding us.</li><li>Briefly state the ultimate issue of the believers' enjoyment of God's divine dispensing in His love.</li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON THIRTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT<br>OF CHRIST AS THE SON<br>IN THE GRACE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>As our portion:	<ol class="decimal">	<li>God.</li>	<li>The Redeemer.</li>	<li>The Passover.</li>	<li>The Savior.</li>	<li>Wisdom.</li>	<li>Righteousness.</li>	<li>Life.</li>	<li>The Sanctifier.</li>	<li>Sanctification.</li>	<li>Redemption.</li>	</ol></li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TEXT</H2><P>In the progressing stage of God's full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The previous five lessons covered the believers' experience and enjoyment of God as the Father in the love of the Triune God. Beginning with this lesson we will go on to see the believers' experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God.</P><P>According to the New Testament, grace is what Christ is to us for our enjoyment (John 1:16-17), that is, Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9) experienced and enjoyed by us through the divine dispensing. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." The love of God is the source, the grace of Christ is the course, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the transmission of the course with the source. Hence, grace issues from God's love. The divine love is with the Father. When this love comes with the Son, it becomes grace (John 1:17). Therefore, grace is not separate from love; love and grace are one reality in two aspects. With the Father we experience and enjoy the divine love; with the Son we experience and enjoy the divine grace. As we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. AS OUR PORTION</H2><P>As we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in His grace, we enjoy Him as our portion. In Colossians 1:12 Paul speaks of Christ as the portion of the saints. The Greek word for portion here may also be translated "lot." Paul used this term with the allotment of the good land among the Israelites in the Old Testament as the background. Among the twelve tribes, every tribe was given a lot, a portion of the good land, as their inheritance. The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ. Today, as the New Testament believers, we do not have the physical land as our portion; rather, our portion is Christ. As the portion of the saints, Christ becomes our divine inheritance for our experience and enjoyment.</P><P>First Corinthians 1:2 says that Christ is "theirs and ours." Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all the believers, for He is the portion given to us by God. We have been called by the faithful God into the fellowship of such a Christ (v. 9), that is, a fellowship in which we partake of the union with, and participate in, God's Son, Jesus Christ, that we may have Him as our portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. God</H2><P>As the believers' portion, Christ is God to us (Titus 1:3; 3:4). Most Christians regard God merely as an object of worship. However, from the Bible we see that God is not only an object of worship; He is our portion for us to enjoy.</P><P>In the conversation between the Lord Jesus and the Samaritan woman, John 4 indicates that the real worship of God is to drink of the living water in our spirit. In verse 14 the Lord said, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life." In verse 24 the Lord went on to say, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness." These two verses show us that the worship of God is the enjoyment of Him as the real drink in our spirit. Hence, Christ as our God is the portion for our enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. The Redeemer</H2><P>Christ is also our Redeemer. In Him we have redemption (Rom. 3:24). To redeem means to purchase back something which originally was ours but which has become lost. Thus, redemption means to repossess at a cost. Originally, we belonged to God; we were His possession. However, because we became fallen and were lost, we became involved in sins and many other negative things that were against God's righteousness, holiness, and glory. We were under the threefold requirement of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory. It was impossible for us to fulfill the requirement, for the price was too great. However, Christ paid the price for us, repossessing us at a tremendous cost. He died on the cross to accomplish eternal redemption for us (Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; Heb. 10:12; 9:28), and His blood has obtained eternal redemption for us (Heb. 9:12, 14; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). Therefore, He is our Redeemer.</P><P>Ephesians 1:7 says, "In whom [the Beloved] we have redemption through His blood." This indicates that we have been redeemed in the Beloved, the One in whom God delights. In the sight of God redemption is something to be delighted in. We have been redeemed through the blood shed for us on the cross by God's Beloved. Now we can enjoy the Beloved as our Redeemer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. The Passover</H2><P>In the book of 1 Corinthians Paul took the history of the children of Israel in the Old Testament as a type of the New Testament believers. In 5:7 Paul said, "Our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed." Paul considered the believers God's chosen people, who have had their Passover, as typified by the children of Israel's experience of the Passover in Exodus 12. In this Passover, Christ is not only the Passover lamb but also the entire Passover. To be our Passover, He was sacrificed on the cross that we might be redeemed and reconciled to God. Thus, we may enjoy Him as a feast before God.</P><P>In chapter six of the Gospel of John, with the Passover feast as the background, the Lord Jesus fed five thousand with five loaves and two fish. After He did that, He revealed Himself as the bread of life and went on to speak concerning our need to eat His flesh and drink His blood (vv. 35, 51, 53-55, 57). At the Passover, people slew the redeeming lamb, struck its blood, and ate its flesh (Exo. 12:3-11). This typifies Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God who was slain so that we may eat His flesh and drink His blood, thus taking Him as the life supply for us to live by. In the Lamb of God there are two elements: the blood for redeeming and the flesh, the meat, for feeding. Therefore, our enjoyment of Christ as our Passover comprises two aspects, the redeeming aspect and the feeding aspect. As the Lamb, the center of the Passover, Christ is our portion for our enjoyment to redeem us and to feed us as well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. The Savior</H2><P>We enjoy Christ not only as our Redeemer but also as our Savior (Titus 1:4). On the one hand, the Lord Jesus died for us and thus accomplished redemption to be our Redeemer; on the other hand, He was raised from the dead and enters into us to be our Savior in life. Romans 5:10 shows us that while we were enemies, through His death, that is, through His redeeming death on the cross, we were reconciled to God; that is, the charge of sins against us before God was settled and we were redeemed. This is the redeeming aspect. But, having been reconciled, much more we will be saved in the life of the resurrected Christ. This is the saving aspect. Redemption, which is accomplished outside of us by the death of Christ, redeems us objectively, once for all. Saving, which is carried out within us by the working of Christ's life, saves us subjectively, daily through our whole life. As we enjoy Him as our Redeemer, we are delivered positionally from condemnation and eternal punishment; as we enjoy Him as our Savior, we are delivered dispositionally from our old man, our self, and our natural life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. Wisdom</H2><P>First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God." This word indicates that at one time Christ was not wisdom to us but that later He became wisdom to us. Christ could not become wisdom to us before we were in Him. But when we believed in Christ, God put us into Christ, and then Christ became wisdom to us.</P><P>For Christ to become wisdom to us from God indicates that there is a transmission of Christ as wisdom from God to us for our daily experience. Christ is unceasingly transmitted to us to be our present and practical wisdom. Therefore, we should remain in the presence of the Lord to receive His dispensing, allowing Him to transmit Himself into us as our wisdom that we may be able to handle the various problems and matters that come to us daily.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>6. Righteousness</H2><P>First Corinthians 1:30 indicates also that Christ is our righteousness. Christ is the righteousness by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life. Here, it is not the righteousness of Christ that has become our righteousness; it is Christ Himself who has become our righteousness. God has made Christ, the embodiment of God Himself, our righteousness.</P><P>Christ as our righteousness is of two aspects: the objective aspect and the subjective aspect. As our objective righteousness, Christ is the One in whom we are justified by God. As our subjective righteousness, Christ is the One dwelling in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and that is acceptable to God. When we live Him and express Him, He becomes our daily righteousness. This is the surpassing righteousness spoken of in Matthew 5:20. Therefore, objective righteousness is the Christ we received when we believed in Him in order to be justified before God. Subjective righteousness is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as the righteousness in our daily life. This is the issue of our daily experience and enjoyment of Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>7. Life</H2><P>Colossians 3:4 speaks of "Christ our life." Christ is God and also life (1 John 5:12). The life which is God, the life that God is, is in Christ (John 1:4). Hence, the Lord Jesus said that He is life (14:6; 11:25) and that He came that we may have life (10:10). Therefore, he who has Christ has life (1 John 5:12), and now He dwells in the believers as life. Just as life is God Himself, so also life is Christ. Just as having life is having God Himself, so also having life is having Christ. Christ is God becoming life to us. Through Christ God is manifested as life. Therefore, Christ is now our life.</P><P>This life is very subjective to us. Nothing is more subjective to us, or more intimately related to us, than our life. Our life is actually we ourselves. To say that Christ becomes our life means that Christ becomes us. That Christ is our life is a strong indication that we are to take Him as our life and live by Him, that we are to live Him in our daily life in order to experience Him, so that all He is and has attained and obtained will not remain objective facts but will become our subjective experience.</P><P>With Christ as our life there are three characteristics. First, this life is a crucified life. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He daily lived a crucified life. If we truly experience Christ as our life, we also will live a crucified life. Such a crucified life is a life that has been processed and thoroughly dealt with. Second, this life is a resurrected life. Nothing, including death, can suppress it. When we live a crucified life, the result is that we will have the resurrected life dispensed into us for us to live a life that manifests the resurrected life. Third, this is a life hidden in God, who is in the heavens (Col. 3:3). Hence, we should no longer be concerned for things on the earth. God in the heavens should be the sphere of our living. With Christ we should live in God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>8. The Sanctifier</H2><P>To the believers Christ is also the Sanctifier. Hebrews 2:11 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One." He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. Both the firstborn Son and the many sons of God are born of the same Father God in resurrection (Acts 13:33; 1 Pet. 1:3). Hence, both the firstborn Son and the many sons are the same in life and nature.</P><P>Christ, our Sanctifier, sanctifies us not only positionally but also dispositionally. He gives us not only a change in our position but also a change in our disposition. In order to be the Sanctifier who sanctifies us dispositionally, Christ had to pass through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, glorification, and exaltation. Before His incarnation, Christ was the only begotten Son of God, having only the divine nature and not the human nature. At that time He could not be our Sanctifier dispositionally. When He was incarnated, He put on human nature. But His human nature was not the Son of God because His human nature had not been born of God. Therefore, He needed to pass through death and resurrection in order for that human part to be born of God. In this way He became the firstborn Son of God, having both the divine nature and the human nature. Now He can be the Sanctifier to us who have been regenerated as the many sons of God and who have both the divine nature and the human nature as He does; He can cause us to be sanctified in disposition as He is.</P><P>Furthermore, Hebrews 13:12 says, "Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate." This is typified in the Old Testament by the blood of the sin offering being brought into the Holy of Holies on the day of propitiation to make propitiation for the people and the body of the sacrifice being burned up outside the camp (Lev. 16:14-16, 27). The blood of Christ, who is the real sin offering, was brought into the true Holy of Holies to accomplish redemption for us, and His body was sacrificed for us outside the gate of the city of Jerusalem. He suffered the death of the cross, shed His blood on it, and entered the Holy of Holies in heaven with His blood (Heb. 9:12) that by the heavenly ministry (8:2, 6) of His heavenly priesthood (7:26) He might be able to do the sanctifying work, and we might enter within the veil by His blood to participate in Him as the heavenly Sanctifier, the One who sanctifies us positionally and dispositionally.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>9. Sanctification</H2><P>Christ is not only our Sanctifier; He Himself is our sanctification (1 Cor. 1:30). Whereas the crucified Christ is for our justification, the resurrected Christ is for our sanctification. As the life-giving Spirit, He indwells us today as our life, and He is saturating us with His holy nature until we are thoroughly sanctified dispositionally. This is not only positional sanctification by the Lord's blood but also dispositional sanctification by the divine life, even by Christ Himself. The Lord who sanctifies us is now working within our spirit, spreading Himself from the center of our being throughout every part of us until He reaches the circumference. Then, we will be completely saturated with His holy nature. The accomplishing of this dispositional sanctification requires our lifetime. If we remain under the dispensing of the Triune God to experience Christ as our dispositional sanctification, we will daily be saturated with the divine nature until we are thoroughly transformed in mind, emotion, and will.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>10. Redemption</H2><P>According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is not only our righteousness and sanctification but also our redemption, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). As the Redeemer of our body, Christ will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory (Phil. 3:21). The body of humiliation is our natural body, made of worthless dust (Gen. 2:7) and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death (Rom. 6:6; 7:24; 8:11). The body of glory is the resurrected body, saturated with God's glory and transcendent over corruption and death (Rom. 6:9).</P><P>The redemption of our body is its glorification. In resurrection Christ became the Spirit, and this Spirit, according to the principle of His regenerating us in our spirit, completely saturates our body of sin, which is of death and is mortal, with the glory of His life and nature. Thus, He transfigures our body, making it the same as His resurrected, glorious body. This is the ultimate step of God's full salvation. Here He is expressed in full unto the ultimate manifestation in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>As we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God. We then enjoy Christ as our portion. As our portion, Christ is God to us, not merely as the object of our worship but as our enjoyment. He is our Redeemer, who accomplished an eternal redemption for us to regain us that we may be delivered positionally from condemnation and eternal punishment. As our Passover, Christ is not only the Passover lamb, but also the entire Passover. As our Savior, Christ delivers us dispositionally from our old man, our self, and our natural life. As our wisdom, He enables us to handle all the problems and things that come to us daily. As our righteousness, Christ, on the one hand, makes it possible for us to be justified by God, and on the other hand, enables us to live a life that is acceptable to God. As our life, He becomes one with us that we may live by Him and live Him out. He is also the Sanctifier, sanctifying us not only positionally but also dispositionally. Furthermore, as our sanctification, He indwells us to be our life, saturating us with His divine nature until we are thoroughly sanctified. As our redemption, He will transfigure our body of humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the relationship between Christ's grace and God's love.</li><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ being the portion of the saints.</li><li>What is the difference between Christ being our Redeemer and Him being our Savior?</li><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ being our Passover.</li><li>Briefly explain how Christ is our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</li><li>Briefly state the three characteristics of Christ being our life.</li><li>Briefly explain how Christ became the Sanctifier who sanctifies us dispositionally.</li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON THIRTY-ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT<br>OF CHRIST AS THE SON<br>IN THE GRACE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>As our portion:	<ol class="decimal" start="11">	<li>The life-giving Spirit.</li>	<li>The freeing and transforming Spirit.</li>	<li>The door.</li>	<li>The pasture.</li>	<li>The Shepherd.</li>	<li>The vine.</li>	<li>The abiding place.</li>	<li>The all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches.</li>	</ol></li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TEXT</H2><P>In this lesson we will continue to see the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God to be the portion of the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>11. The Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>In order that He may be our portion for our experience and enjoyment, Christ is also the life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45 says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." The last Adam was the Lord Jesus in the flesh. On the cross, as the Lamb of God, He took away our sin. This made it possible for us to receive His divine life. Then He was raised from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit to impart life into us. When we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Redeemer, He as the life-giving Spirit came into us as our life.</P><P>The life-giving Spirit is the reality and the life pulse of Christ's resurrection. If Christ had merely been resurrected with a body and had not become the life-giving Spirit, His resurrection would simply be a fact and could not impart life into us. However, Christ's resurrection is absolutely a matter related to the life-giving Spirit, for in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, who imparts life into the believers. Actually, the life-giving Spirit is the processed Triune God. The Triune God has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Now in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit with the life essence to enter into all those who believe and receive Him to make them the new creation. This life-giving Spirit is the totality of all that Christ is as the all-inclusive One. Christ as the all-inclusive One has now become the life-giving Spirit, the totality of all that He is for our experience and enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>12. The Freeing and Transforming Spirit</H2><P>As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is also the freeing and transforming Spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." According to the context, the Lord here refers to Christ the Lord. This is a strong word in the Bible, telling us emphatically that Christ the Lord is the Spirit. Furthermore, the phrase the Spirit of the Lord indicates that the Spirit and the Lord are one. The Spirit of the Lord is actually the Lord Himself, with whom there is freedom. The freedom here mainly denotes the freedom from the letter of the law (Gal. 2:4; 5:1). When our heart turns to Christ, we are freed from the bondage of the letter of the law.</P><P>Second Corinthians 3:18 goes on to say, "We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit." As the Spirit, the Lord not only gives us freedom, freeing us from the bondage of the law, but He also transforms us that we may have His glorious image. When we with unveiled face are beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done. Thus, we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence; that is, we are being transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2), into His image. The image here is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. To be transformed into the same image is to be conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, to be made the same as He is (Rom. 8:29). Through the process of transformation we will go on in God's life from one degree of glory to another degree until we are altogether the same as He is.</P><P>The Lord Spirit transforms us that we may have the image of Christ. This implies that the Spirit supplies us with the riches of Christ. When we receive this supply and enjoy the Lord, who is the Spirit, the Spirit infuses us with the elements of Christ's person and work to eliminate and replace our old elements and produce something new. This is similar to the way new cells and tissues are produced in our body through the process of metabolism. This is the transformation spoken of in the Bible. When we experience and enjoy Christ the Son as the all-inclusive, life-giving, freeing, and transforming Spirit, we receive continually His rich supply and are being transformed into the image that is the same as Christ's.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>13. The Door</H2><P>To the believers, Christ is also the door through which God's people leave the sheepfold and come into the pasture (John 10:9). The sheepfold signifies the law; it also signifies Judaism, the religion of the law. The pasture signifies Christ as the feeding place of the believers. In the Old Testament time, God put His elect under the custody of the law, so the law became the sheepfold in which God's people were temporarily kept and protected. When the fullness of the time came, God did not want His people to be kept in the sheepfold of the law any longer; He desired that they come out of the sheepfold and enter into Christ. Thereafter, through Christ God's people can leave the sheepfold and enter into the pasture. Those who came out of the fold of the law after Christ came were people like Peter, John, James, and Paul. Now, since we, the New Testament believers as God's chosen people, have Christ as the door for the sheep to leave the fold, we are not under the custody of the law; we are under the supply of grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>14. The Pasture</H2><P>In John 10:9 the Lord revealed that He is not only the door but also the pasture, the feeding place for the sheep. When the pasture is not available in the winter time or in the night, the sheep must be kept in the fold. When the pasture is ready, there is no further need for the sheep to remain in the fold. To be kept in the fold is transitional and temporary. To be in the pasture enjoying its riches is final and permanent. Before Christ came, the law was a ward, and to be under the law was transitional. Now, since Christ has come, all God's people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture. This should be final and permanent.</P><P>Furthermore, in verse 10 the Lord said, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly." This shows us that the Lord is the rich life supply for the sheep. If we as the sheep of the Lord desire to receive Him as the supply, we must remain in Him as the pasture. Today this pasture is the resurrected Christ, the life-giving Spirit, as our abundant life and life supply. In our daily Christian life we should have a definite realization that it is in Christ as the pasture that we enjoy His rich life supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>15. The Shepherd</H2><P>In addition to being the door and the pasture, Christ is our Shepherd. He calls His sheep by name and leads them out of the fold. Then He goes before the sheep, and they follow Him (John 10:2-3). As the Shepherd, Christ leads His sheep out of the fold through Himself as the door and into Himself as the pasture.</P><P>In John 10:11 the Lord said, "I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep." As the good Shepherd, Christ laid down His soul-life, His human life, to accomplish redemption for His sheep that they may share His divine life, the eternal life. Now He shepherds us inwardly in the way of life as our Shepherd of life. The more we live by Him as our life, the more we enjoy His shepherding. As we are under His shepherding, there will be a life consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life. This life consciousness with its instruction and guidance in life is an indication that we are under the Lord's shepherding.</P><P>Furthermore, in 10:16 the Lord said He will bring His other sheep, the Gentiles believers, to form them into one flock under one Shepherd. The one flock signifies the one church, the one Body of Christ (Eph. 2:14-16; 3:6), brought forth by life, which the Lord imparted into His members through His death. In nature, the flock is altogether different from the fold. The fold is Judaism, which is of letters and ordinances, whereas the flock is the church, which is of life and Spirit. Christ, our good Shepherd, has brought us out of the fold into the flock in Himself as the pasture that we may enjoy Him as our life and life supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>16. The Vine</H2><P>To the believers Christ is also the vine in the divine dispensing of the Triune God. In John 15:1 the Lord said, "I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman." This true vine (the Son) with its branches (the believers in the Son) is the organism of the Triune God in God's economy. This organism grows with His riches and expresses His divine life.</P><P>The Father as the husbandman is the source, the author, the planner, the planter, the life, the substance, the soil, the water, the air, the sunshine, and everything to the vine. The Son as the vine is the center of God's economy and the embodiment of all the riches of the Father. The Father, by cultivating the Son, works Himself with all His riches into this vine, and eventually the vine expresses the Father through its branches in a corporate way. This is the Father's economy in the universe.</P><P>The vine and the branches illustrate adequately the living relationship between the believers and the Lord. Once we believe into the Lord, we become the branches of Christ as the vine and we have Christ as our life and everything. Whatever is in the vine is also in the branches. From the vine and through the vine we receive the supply that we need as our enjoyment. For this reason, we need to abide in the vine. Only when we abide in the vine can the vine be everything to us. Therefore, in 15:4-5 the Lord said, "Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine....He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing." This shows us that our destiny as branches is to abide in the Lord as the vine. We cannot live by ourselves alone; without the Lord's supply we will wither and die. Apart from the Lord we are nothing, we have nothing, and we can do nothing. All that we are, all that we have, and all that we do must be in and by the Lord, who dwells in us. When we thus abide in the Lord and the Lord abides in us so that we enjoy all the supply of His abundant life, we bear much fruit by the overflow of the abundance of the inner life for the expression of the Father's divine life (v. 8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>17. The Abiding Place</H2><P>To the believers Christ is also their abiding place. In John 15:4 the Lord said, "Abide in Me." The Greek word for abide means not only to remain in a certain place but to dwell there, even to make our home there. Christ is our abiding place, our home, and we can abide in Him to have fellowship with Him and enjoy all His riches. For this reason, we need to continually abide in Him, settle down in Him, and take Him as our abiding place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>18. The All-inclusive One<br>with the Unsearchable Riches</H2><P>Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is the One who fills all in all. Christ, as the infinite God, is without any limitation and is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such an all-extensive and all-filling Christ has the unsearchable riches (3:8). These riches are what Christ is to us, what He has for us, and what He has accomplished, attained, and obtained for us. These riches of Christ are unsearchable and untraceable. As God, He is the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Lord, and the Christ. As man, He is the Apostle, the Shepherd, the Forerunner, and the Captain of our salvation. There are countless aspects of the riches of what Christ is, for He is the reality of all positive things in the universe, and all positive things signify Christ. Therefore, when He was on earth, He could use so many things as illustrations of Himself. He could say, "I am the door" (John 10:9) and "I am the way" (14:6). To us He is also the real light, life, breath, water, food, clothing, and dwelling place.</P><P>The unsearchable riches of Christ are all the fullness of the Godhead, spoken of in Colossians 2:9, which fullness now dwells bodily in Christ. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead, but the expression of the riches of what God is. When Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, all the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in Him as One who has a human body. Therefore, the divine attributes and human virtues are included in the unsearchable riches of Christ. Christ is love, light, holiness, righteousness, wisdom, and power; He is also humility, patience, sincerity, and goodness.</P><P>In the Old Testament, the good land of Canaan, which God gave to the children of Israel, is a complete type of Christ as the all-inclusive One (Deut. 8:7-10; 11:11-12). The produce of the good land portrays the unsearchable riches of Christ. Christ as the all-inclusive One is the genuine good land to the believers. All His unsearchable riches have been given to us to be our portion, a portion which we can never exhaust. We should do our best to experience, enjoy, and apply such an all-inclusive One that we may obtain all His unsearchable riches.</P><H1 CLASS=SERIES>SUMMARY</H1><P>As our portion for our experience and enjoyment Christ is also the life-giving Spirit. In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit who, with His life essence and all that He is, is in us for our experience and enjoyment, and as such, He is the freeing and transforming Spirit. As the Spirit, the Lord not only gives us freedom, freeing us from the bondage of the law, but also transforms us that we may have His glorious image. He is also the door through which God's people leave the sheepfold and come into the pasture. Since we have such a Christ, we are no longer under the custody of the law; rather, we are under the supply of grace. Christ is also the pasture, the feeding place for the sheep, in which we can enjoy His abundant life supply. He is also the Shepherd, who laid down His soul-life to accomplish redemption for us that we may share His divine life and live under His shepherding to become one flock. He is also the vine, and as such, He is life and everything to us, His branches. When we abide in the Lord as the vine and enjoy all the supply of His abundant life, we bear much fruit by the overflow of the abundance of the inner life. He is also the abiding place, in which we abide to have fellowship with Him and enjoy all His riches. He is also the all-inclusive One with the unsearchable riches, including the divine attributes and human virtues. As the reality of all positive things in the universe, the genuine good land to the believers, He has given to us all His unsearchable riches to be our portion for us to apply, experience, and enjoy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly explain how the life-giving Spirit is the reality and life pulse of Christ's resurrection.</li><li>How can we experience Christ as the freeing and transforming Spirit?</li><li>Briefly explain how Christ is the door, the pasture, and the Shepherd for our experience and enjoyment.</li><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ being the vine and us being the branches.</li><li>Briefly explain the unsearchable riches of the all- inclusive Christ.</li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON THIRTY-TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT<br>OF CHRIST AS THE SON<br>IN THE GRACE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>As our portion:	<ol class="decimal" start="19">	<li>Spiritual food.</li>	<li>The rock flowing with the spiritual drink.</li>	<li>Light.</li>	<li>The way.</li>	<li>The reality.</li>	<li>The hope of glory.</li>	<li>Peace.</li>	<li>Joy.</li>	<li>Rest.</li>	</ol></li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>TEXT</H2><P>In this lesson we will continue to see other aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>19. Spiritual Food</H2><P>As the portion of the saints, Christ is also the believers' spiritual food. First Corinthians 10:3 says that the children of Israel went out of Egypt, crossed the Red Sea, and "all ate the same spiritual food" in the wilderness. The spiritual food here refers to manna (Exo. 16:14-18), which typifies Christ as the daily life supply (John 6:31-35) for the believers' journey. We believers should all eat the same spiritual food, not eating anything other than Christ.</P><P>The Christ who is our spiritual food is the Christ who becomes subjective to us. He is the processed Triune God indwelling our spirit subjectively as the all-inclusive Spirit. Therefore, He can be our daily spiritual food. Anything that is to be our food and life supply must be something that can enter into us and then be digested and assimilated by us to become the elements of our tissue and fiber. This is precisely what Christ is to us. When we eat Christ as our spiritual food, He enters into us and mingles with us as one.</P><P>In John 6:48 the Lord declared that He was the bread of life, indicating that He would be man's life supply in the form of food, like the tree of life (Gen. 2:9). He was God incarnated in order to be the bread of life for us to eat. He came down from heaven not only to be our Savior but also to be our food. In John 6 we see five characteristics of Christ as our food: the heavenly bread (vv. 41, 50, 51, 58), the bread of God (v. 33), the bread of life (v. 35), the living bread (v. 51), and the true bread (v. 32). As the bread that came down out of heaven, Christ is the heavenly bread. As the bread of God, He is of God, He was sent by God, and He had God with Him. As the bread of life, He is the bread with eternal life. As the living bread, He is living. As the true bread, He is the bread of truth, or reality; all other kinds of food are merely shadows of Him as the real food. The reality of the food we eat daily is Jesus Christ. He is the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life. We all need to receive Him as the bread of life, the spiritual food, to us.</P><P>In 6:57 the Lord said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me." To eat is to take food into us that it may be assimilated organically into our body. Hence, to eat Jesus is to receive Him into us that He may be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. Then we live by the Lord whom we have received. This is the living that we should have according to God's ordination in His economy. For our spiritual living, Christ should be our unique food for us to be daily strengthened, sustained, and satisfied by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>20. The Rock Flowing with the Spiritual Drink</H2><P>Christ is not only our spiritual food to be our daily life supply; He is also the rock flowing with the spiritual drink to quench our thirst. First Corinthians 10:4 says that the children of Israel "all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ." The spiritual drink refers to the living water that flowed out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6), which typifies the Spirit who flowed out of the crucified and resurrected Christ as our all-inclusive drink (John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13). We should all drink the same spiritual drink, not drinking anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit.</P><P>The rock that was smitten and cleft to flow out the living water for God's chosen people was a physical rock. Yet Paul called it a spiritual rock, because it typified Christ smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life to satisfy the thirst of the believers. Hence, the apostle said that the rock was Christ. Since it was a spiritual rock signifying Christ, it was able to follow the children of Israel. This indicates that Christ as the real rock is following His believers. Through incarnation He came to earth and was smitten on the cross by the law of God with its power and authority. His side was cleft (John 19:34) and water flowed forth. This water, which is the Spirit, the ultimate issue of the Triune God, quenches our thirst and fully satisfies our entire being.</P><P>We should not regard the eating and drinking of Christ as mere parables or metaphors. These are facts to us. Daily, even hourly, we should eat and drink the Lord Jesus. Although eating and drinking are very common in our daily life, in the Bible they are matters of crucial significance. As we eat and drink certain food, the elements contained in the food are taken into us, and when they have been digested and assimilated, they become one with us in substance and essence. Actually, they become the fibers and constituents within us. Similarly, as we eat and drink Christ, He works Himself into us to be our life element and becomes one with us organically.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>21. Light</H2><P>To the believers Christ is also light. John 1:4 says, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men." Once we believe in the Lord Jesus and receive Him into us, we have the Son of God and we have life. This life in us becomes our light of life (8:12). Many times, when we have called on the name of the Lord Jesus to contact Him and receive Him, the divine light came into us to shine in us. That shining was the shining of Christ Himself as light. This light was not an objective light enlightening us from without; it was a subjective light shining within us. The shining of the light within us is a strong confirmation that we have been born of God, that we are God's children with God's life.</P><P>As believers we experience Christ's shining as light not only by the Lord's life but also through the Lord's word (Psa. 119:105, 130), because the words which the Lord speaks to us are life (John 6:63). When we hear the Lord's word and receive God's life, the life becomes the light shining within to enlighten us. Christ is the Word, which was from the beginning (John 1:1), as the definition, explanation, and expression of God by which we may know God. When we receive Him as the Word, the expression of God, we have the light of life that is in Him, and we live under His enlightening.</P><P>Ephesians 5:14 also indicates that Christ is the light to the believers. There it says, "Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." The sleeping one, who is also the dead one, one who has lost his consciousness in the spirit, needs the reproving spoken of in the preceding verses. When his works of darkness are reproved or exposed (vv. 11, 13), he will receive Christ's shining. This verse also shows us the way to receive the shining. The light is already there; we simply need to receive it. Whenever we fall into a dark and dead situation, we simply need to return to the spirit and turn to the indwelling Christ; then He will shine on us that we may live in the light.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>22. The Way</H2><P>Christ is also the believers' way to the Father. In John 14:6 the Lord said, "I am the way...; no one comes to the Father except through Me." This clearly indicates that Christ is the way for man to enter into God. Since the way is the Lord, a living person, the place to which the Lord brings man must also be a person, God the Father Himself. The Lord Himself is the living way by which man is brought into God the Father, the living person.</P><P>To have Christ as our way to the Father means that when we take Christ, we get the Father. When we walk in Christ as the way, we arrive at the destination, which is the Father. Hence, we take Christ as the way and we enter into the Father. Christ is the living way for us to get into God the Father, the living person. The Father is holy and dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). We are sinful and are also involved with the world, Satan, and other negative things. Sin, the world, and Satan are three great obstacles that make it impossible for us to come to the Father. However, through His death on the cross Christ dealt with sin, the world, and Satan and cleared away all the negative things and obstacles between us and God. Thus He became our way into the Father. When we enter into Christ as the way, we arrive at the Father, because the Son is one with the Father. Therefore, to be in the Son is also to be in the Father. Once we are in Christ Jesus, there is no longer any distance between us and God. This is not a mere doctrine but a spiritual fact. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we are immediately in the Triune God in an experiential way and enjoy the riches of the Triune God through the divine dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>23. The Reality</H2><P>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus also said that He is the reality. Without Christ, the entire universe is empty, having no reality. Christ is the incarnated God, and in Him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily (Col. 2:9) that He may become the reality of God and man (John 1:18, 51; 1 Tim. 2:5) and the reality of all the divine and spiritual things, such as the divine life and resurrection (John 11:25; 14:6), the divine light (8:12; 9:5), the divine way (14:6), wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30), for our possession and enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>24. The Hope of Glory</H2><P>In Colossians 1:27 Paul speaks of "Christ in you, the hope of glory." Christ not only dwells within us; He dwells within us as our hope of glory. Christ can be our hope of glory because He dwells in our spirit to be our life and our person. Colossians 3:4 says that when Christ is manifested, we also will be manifested with Him in glory. This indicates that the indwelling Christ will saturate our entire being and cause our body to be transfigured and conformed to the body of His glory (Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21). At that time Christ will be glorified in us. This is Christ in us as the hope of glory.</P><P>Glory is the expression of God. God has ordained that we should be brought into this glory (1 Cor. 2:7), and, as believers, we have been called into this glory (1 Thes. 2:12; 1 Pet. 5:10). When we were regenerated, Christ as the life of glory came into us as the divine seed that eventually will blossom into the full expression of God. Just as we hope for the blossoming of a seed that has been sown, so we hope for the full expression of the life of glory that is in us. Our hope of such a glory is the indwelling Christ Himself.</P><P>In Ephesians 1:18 Paul speaks of the hope of God's calling, which is related to Christ as the hope of glory. Before we were saved, we were "apart from Christ...having no hope and without God in the world" (2:12). But now that we are saved, we are no longer without hope; instead, we are full of hope. The hope of God's calling includes: (1) Christ Himself and the salvation He will bring to us when He comes back (Col. 1:27; 1 Pet. 1:5, 9); (2) the rapturous transfer from the earthly and physical realm to the heavenly and spiritual sphere, plus glorification (Rom. 8:23-25, 30; Phil. 3:21); (3) the kingly enjoyment with Christ in the millennium (Rev. 5:10; 2 Tim. 4:18); and (4) the consummate enjoyment of Christ in the New Jerusalem, with the universal and eternal blessings in the new heaven and new earth (Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5). These are the portions which Christ as the hope of glory will bring to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>25. Peace</H2><P>Christ is also our peace. Ephesians 2:14 says, "He [Christ] Himself is our peace." Our refers to both the Jewish and the Gentile believers. The peace spoken of here is not the peace between God and man but the peace between one man and another. Through the blood of Christ we have been brought near not only to God but also to one another. Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both the Jewish and the Gentile believers, is Himself our peace. Due to man's fall and God's selection and calling, there was a separation between Israel, God's chosen people, and the Gentiles. Through Christ's redemption this separation has been removed. Now the two are one in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness.</P><P>Christ is also the peace within us. In John 14:27 the Lord said, "Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." The peace the Lord gives overcomes all troubles and fears, especially those caused by the persecution of religion. At that time, when the disciples heard that the Lord was going to leave them, their hearts were troubled (v. 1), and they were afraid because they were under the fear of the Jewish religion that was opposing and persecuting them. The Lord told them that He left His peace with them, a peace that was actually the Lord Himself. No matter what opposition and persecution we may face, the Lord within us is our peace, and we may experience and enjoy Him and thereby enjoy peace.</P><P>In 16:33 the Lord also said, "These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world." This indicates that the believers have peace in the overcoming Christ. Although the Lord Jesus died, has been resurrected, and has ascended to heaven, we remain in the world where there is no peace, and we are often troubled by the world. But the Lord promised that He will be our peace and that we may have peace in Him. No matter how much the world persecutes us and troubles us, Christ is our peace and He has overcome the world.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>26. Joy</H2><P>Christ is also joy to the believers. In John 15:11 the Lord said, "These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full." The context of this verse is the Lord's word concerning the vine and the branches being an organism to glorify the Father by expressing the riches of the divine life (vv. 1-11). For us to be branches of the divine vine and to bear fruit to express the divine life is a matter of joy&#151;a joyful life. If we abide in the Lord and keep abiding in Him by abiding in His love so that we may bear much fruit to express the riches of His life for the glorification of the Father, we will be filled with joy. Our joy always comes from our abiding in the Lord, from our abiding in His love, and from our fruit-bearing in His rich life for the glorification of the Father. It is in this kind of life that we are full of joy. Actually, this joy is Christ Himself. When He abides in us, His joy abides in us to be the source of our joy that our joy may abound and become full.</P><P>In Philippians, a book written by Paul concerning the experience of Christ, we are repeatedly told that we should rejoice in the Lord. In 3:1 Paul said, "Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, for me it is not irksome, but for you it is safe." Here Paul charged the Philippian believers, who were troubled by the Judaizers, to rejoice in the Lord. This indicates that to rejoice in the Lord is a safeguard, a security, that shields the believers from all troubles. Furthermore, 4:4 says, "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice." Rejoicing is a sign of the believers, it is a portion measured by God to us, and it should be our living and condition. This joy enables us to live our days with joy in any kind of situation day by day, to endure and suffer long with joy (Col. 1:11), and even to have abundance of joy in much proving of affliction (2 Cor. 8:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>27. Rest</H2><P>Christ is not only the believers' peace and joy but also their rest. In Matthew 11:28 the Lord Jesus called people, saying, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." The toil spoken of in this verse refers not only to the toil of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations but also to the toil of struggling to be successful in any work. Whoever toils thus is always heavily burdened. The Lord called such toiling ones to come to Him for rest. Rest refers not only to being set free from the toil and burden under the law and religion or under any work or responsibility, but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction.</P><P>Then the Lord showed us the way to rest. He said, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" (v. 29). To take the Lord's yoke is to take the will of the Father. It is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligation of the law or religion or to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father. The Lord lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38). He submitted Himself fully to the Father's will (Matt. 26:39, 42). Therefore, He asks us to learn from Him, the One who is meek and lowly in heart. He did not resist any opposition, nor did He esteem Himself highly. In all the opposition He was meek, and in all the rejection He was lowly. He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself. Hence, no matter what the situation was, He had rest in His heart. He was fully satisfied with His Father's will.</P><P>If we take His yoke upon us and learn from Him, we will find rest for our souls. This is an inward rest. If we are opposed as we minister, and we resist, we will not have peace. But if instead of resisting we learn from the Lord and submit to the will of the Father, we will have rest in our souls; that is, we will enjoy the indwelling Christ as the rest in our deepest part.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>As the portion of the saints, Christ is our spiritual food, the true bread of life sent by God as our daily life supply for our journey. He is also the rock flowing with the spiritual drink. He was smitten and cleft for us on the cross to flow out the water of life; now He is always following us to quench our thirst. He is also the light. By His being our life and by His speaking to us, He shines within us that we may live in the light. He is also the way, the living way for us to enter into God the Father, the living person; through Him we are able to get into the Father. He is also the reality. He is God coming to be our reality and the reality of all the divine and spiritual things for our possession and enjoyment. He is also the hope of glory. He dwells in our spirit to be our life and person; eventually, He will saturate our entire being and cause our body to be transfigured unto the full expression of God. He is also the peace. Through His accomplished redemption, He removed the separation between the believers that they may be one with one another. Furthermore, He is in us to be our peace that we may overcome all troubles, fears, and persecutions. He is also our joy. When He abides in us, His joy abides in us to be the source of our joy that our joy may abound and become full and that we may live our days with joy. He is also the rest. He enables all those who toil and are burdened to be set free and to enjoy perfect peace and satisfaction; if we take His yoke upon us and learn from Him, we will find rest for our souls.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the five characteristics of Christ's being our food as shown in John 6.</li><li>How does Christ as the rock flowing with the spiritual drink flow forth water to quench our thirst?</li><li>How do we believers have Christ as our light in our experience?</li><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ's being the way and the reality.</li><li>What are the different aspects included in the hope of God's calling?</li><li>Briefly explain how Christ is the peace among us and how He is also the peace within us.</li><li>Briefly state the way for us to have Christ as our rest.</li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON THIRTY-THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT<br>OF CHRIST AS THE SON<br>IN THE GRACE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>As our portion:	<ol class="decimal" start="28">	<li>The feast.</li>	<li>The new moon.</li>	<li>The Sabbath.</li>	<li>The armor:		<ol class="lower-alpha">		<li>The girdle of truth.</li>		<li>The breastplate of righteousness.</li>		<li>The firm foundation of the gospel of peace.</li>		<li>The shield of faith.</li>		<li>The helmet of salvation.</li>		<li>The sword of the Spirit.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>TEXT</H2><P>In this lesson we will continue to see the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son in the grace of the Triune God to be the portion of the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>28. The Feast</H2><P>Christ as our portion for our enjoyment is also our feast. Colossians 2:16-17 says, "Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ." The various items of the ceremonial law mentioned here are a shadow of the spiritual things in Christ, which are the things to come, but the body is of Christ and is Christ. The body, like a man's physical body, is the substance, something solid. The rituals in the law are a shadow of the real things in the gospel. Christ is the reality of the gospel. All the good things in the gospel belong to Christ and are Christ.</P><P>Paul's word here indicates that to the believers Christ is the feast. This is typified by the yearly feasts of the Jews, such as the Passover, the Feast of Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles. Three times a year the Jews went up to Jerusalem to keep the feasts, to eat, drink, and rejoice together with God before Him. Therefore, the feasts signify joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction. Although the feasts were enjoyable, they were simply shadows of Christ. Christ is our real joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction. Christ is the reality of all the feasts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>29. The New Moon</H2><P>Colossians 2:16-17 also indicates that Christ is the new moon. The new moon signifies a new beginning with light in darkness. As such a new moon to us, Christ affords us a new beginning with light in this dark age. This is also what we experience and enjoy of Christ as our portion. In the process of our growth, again and again we need Christ to be our fresh start, our new beginning, which is signified by the new moon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>30. The Sabbath</H2><P>Colossians 2:16-17 also shows us that Christ is the real Sabbath. The Sabbath signifies completion and rest. After God completed His work of creation on the sixth day, He enjoyed rest on the seventh day. God blessed the seventh day and made it the Sabbath (Gen. 2:2-3). Therefore, after man was created, man did not work first; instead, man first enjoyed rest. To enjoy rest before work&#151;this is the gospel. The significance of Christ's being our Sabbath is that we do not work but enter into what He has accomplished and rest in Him. Christ has accomplished all His work and is sitting on the right hand of God in the heavenlies. Now He is in our spirit to be our rest.</P><P>Feasts are yearly, new moons monthly, Sabbaths weekly, and eating and drinking daily. Daily we eat and drink Christ, weekly we have completion and rest in Him, monthly we experience a new beginning in Him, and throughout the year we experience Him as our joy and enjoyment. Therefore, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly Christ is to us the reality of every positive thing and is for our enjoyment and experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>31. The Armor</H2><P>Christ is also our armor. Ephesians 6:11 says, "Put on the whole armor of God." To defeat God's enemy, the devil, the believers need to put on the whole armor of God. To fight the spiritual warfare, we need not only the power of the Lord but also the armor of God. Our weapons do not avail, but God's armor, even the whole armor of God, does avail. The whole armor of God is for the entire Body of Christ, the church. The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers are parts of this unique warrior. Only the corporate warrior, not an individual believer, can wear the whole armor of God. Hence, we must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body of Christ, not individually.</P><P>Ephesians 6:14-17 shows us six aspects of Christ as our armor: the girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the firm foundation of the gospel of peace (the shoes), the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit. Of these six items of Christ as our armor, only the sword is for offensive warfare against the enemy; all the other items are for defense.</P><P>We must put on Christ as the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil (v. 11). These stratagems are the devil's evil plan. Not only does the devil have an evil will, but he also has subtle stratagems to work out his will. If we want to stand against these stratagems, we must put on Christ as our armor. To us the armor has six aspects:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>a. The Girdle of Truth</H2><P>Ephesians 6:14 says, "Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth." For us to gird our loins with truth is to strengthen our entire being. For the purpose of standing, our whole being needs to be strengthened with truth. Truth here refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and experienced by us as our living (John 14:6). This is actually Christ Himself lived out by us. Such truth, such reality, is the girdle that strengthens our whole being for spiritual warfare.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>b. The Breastplate of Righteousness</H2><P>Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the putting on of the breastplate of righteousness. The breastplate of righteousness covers our conscience, signified by the breast. Satan is our accuser. Therefore, in fighting against him we need a conscience void of offense. No matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we still need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness. Righteousness is a matter of being right with both God and man. If we have a little problem with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which all of our faith and boldness will leak out. Hence, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy's accusation. Such righteousness is Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). He is the breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience. Hence, we are covered not by our own righteousness but by Christ as our righteousness. Furthermore, the breastplate of righteousness is related to the blood of Christ. In experience we cannot separate the blood from Christ. Apart from His blood, Christ cannot cover us. Under the cleansing of His blood, He becomes our righteousness as our breastplate of righteousness to cover our conscience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>c. The Firm Foundation of the Gospel of Peace</H2><P>Ephesians 6:15 says, "And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace." Our feet must be shod in order to strengthen our stand in the battle. The firm foundation of the gospel of peace means the establishment of the gospel of peace. Christ made peace for us on the cross both with God and with man, and this peace has become our gospel (Eph. 2:13-17). This gospel of peace has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod. Thus, we will have a firm footing that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare. The peace for such a firm foundation also is Christ (v. 14).</P><P>As we fight against the evil powers, the peace which Christ has accomplished is a firm foundation for our feet. If we would take part in the spiritual warfare, our feet must be shod with this firm foundation. We fight in peace and with peace. Christ is the peace for us to be one with God and with the saints. This peace is the firm foundation that enables us to stand against the enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>d. The Shield of Faith</H2><P>Ephesians 6:16 continues, "Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one." We need truth to gird our loins, righteousness to cover our conscience, peace as shoes to cover our feet, and faith as a shield to protect our entire being. If we live by God as reality (truth), we have righteousness (4:24), and righteousness issues in peace (Heb. 12:11; Isa. 32:17). Having all these, we can easily have faith as a shield against the flaming darts of the evil one. Christ is the Author and Perfecter of such faith (Heb. 12:2).</P><P>The shield of faith is not something that we put on, but something that we take up in order to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy. Faith comes after truth, righteousness, and peace. If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we will spontaneously have faith. This faith is a safeguard against the fiery darts, the attacks, of the enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>e. The Helmet of Salvation</H2><P>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul said, "And receive the helmet of salvation." This is for covering our mind against the negative thoughts directed at us by the evil one. Such a helmet, such a covering, is God's salvation. Satan injects into our mind threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts. God's salvation is the shield that we put on to cover our mentality against all these. Such a salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life (John 16:33).</P><P>Satan's darts come to us through our mind. Therefore, just as our conscience needs the breastplate of righteousness and our will needs the shield of faith, so our mind needs the helmet of salvation. We need truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation. Righteousness issues in peace, and peace gives us the ground to have faith. Then faith brings in salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>f. The Sword of the Spirit</H2><P>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul also told us to receive "the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God." In God's armor, the sword is the one item that is used for attacking the enemy. After we put on the girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, and the shoes of the gospel of peace, and we take up the shield of faith and receive the helmet of salvation, we are entirely protected, and we may then receive the sword of the Spirit. The Spirit is the sword itself. Furthermore, the Spirit is the word of God; hence, the word of God is also a sword. Therefore, in our Christian experience, these three&#151;the sword, the Spirit, and the word&#151;are one. Without the word, we have neither the Spirit nor the sword. When we contact the word of God in a living way, the word becomes the Spirit to us, and the Spirit is the sword for our offensive attack against the enemy that we may kill him.</P><P>When we have the whole armor mentioned above, we are able to stand against the stratagems of the devil, and having done all, to stand.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>As our portion for our enjoyment, Christ is also our feast, new moon, and Sabbath. As our feast, Christ brings us real joy, enjoyment, and satisfaction. As our new moon, Christ brings us light in this dark age for us to have a new beginning. As our Sabbath, Christ has accomplished everything for us that we may enjoy real rest in Him. Christ is also the armor that we put on, enabling us to stand against the stratagems of the devil. This armor comprises the girdle of truth for the strengthening of our entire being, the breastplate of righteousness for the covering of our conscience to protect us from the accusation of the enemy, the shoes of the gospel of peace as our firm foundation for us to stand, the shield of faith that protects our will against the attacks of the enemy's fiery darts, the helmet of salvation that covers our mind against the negative thoughts injected into us by the evil one, and the sword of the Spirit for us to kill the enemy. When we put on the whole armor of God, we are able to stand against the stratagems of the devil, and having done all, to stand.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ's being our feast, new moon, and Sabbath.</li><li>What are the six aspects of Christ's being our whole armor?</li><li>How is Christ's being our breastplate of righteousness related to His blood?</li><li>Briefly state the function of the firm foundation of the gospel of peace in the spiritual warfare.</li><li>Briefly explain the only item in the whole armor that is for attacking the enemy.</li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON THIRTY-FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT<br>OF CHRIST AS THE SON<br>IN THE GRACE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>As our portion:	<ol class="decimal" start="32">	<li>The One living within us that we may live Him.</li>	<li>The One being formed within us.</li>	<li>The One making His home in our hearts.</li>	<li>The One magnified in us.</li>	<li>The One empowering us.</li>	</ol></li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>TEXT</H2><P>In this lesson we will continue to see other aspects of Christ being the portion for the believers' enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>32. The One Living within Us<br>That We May Live Him</H2><P>In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." Although Paul said that "it is no longer I who live," he also said that "it is Christ who lives in me." It was Christ who lived, yet it was in Paul that He lived. Christ and Paul, they two, had one life and one living. This shows us that Christ is not only life to us, the believers, but also a person living in us. We have another person, Christ, living within us.</P><P>We must see this vision: the One who died on the cross for our redemption is living now in us. I have died in Christ through His death, but now He lives in me through His resurrection. According to the revelation of the New Testament, on the one hand, this resurrected Christ is in the third heavens; on the other hand, He lives in us. His living in us is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). As the life-giving Spirit, He lives in us to be our life and our person.</P><P>In John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said, "As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me." The Son did not live by Himself; He lived because of the Father. This does not mean that the Son was set aside and ceased to exist. The Son, of course, continued to exist, but He did not live His own life. Instead, He lived the life of the Father. He had one life and one living with the Father. It is the same in our relationship with Christ today. We live by Him, and He lives in us. On the one hand, we are terminated; on the other hand, we continue to exist. However, we do not exist without Christ; we live because of Him and live with Him. Hence, we have one life and one living with Him. Not only so, we live because of Him by eating Him. To eat is to take food into us to be assimilated into our body organically. Hence, to eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us that He may be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. Then we live by the Lord whom we have received.</P><P>In Philippians 1:21 Paul said, "To me, to live is Christ." Paul's life was to live Christ. To him to live was Christ, not the law or circumcision. He would not live the law but would live Christ, not be found in the law but be found in Christ (3:9). Christ was not only his life but also his living. He lived Christ because Christ lived in him. He was one with Christ both in life and in living. He and Christ had one life and one living. They lived together as one person. Christ lived within Paul as Paul's life, and Paul lived Christ without as Christ's living.</P><P>Christ lives in us so that we may live Him. The normal experience of Christ is to live Christ, and to live Christ is to have Christ magnified always under any circumstance. We need to practice living Christ in our daily life, whether in great things or in small things. Our experience and practice of living Christ must reach the extent that others can see that in all things, in every detail of our life, we are in Christ. Christ lives in us as life and we live Him as His expression. This must be something real and practical to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>33. The One Being Formed within Us</H2><P>In Galatians 4:19 Paul said, "My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you." When the Galatian believers were regenerated through Paul's preaching of the gospel to them the first time, Christ was born into them but not formed in them. The apostle then travailed again that Christ might be formed in them. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ fully grown in us. First, Christ was born into us at the time we repented and believed in Him, then He lives in us in our Christian life, and, finally, He will be formed in us at our maturity. Christ's being formed in us is needed that we may be sons of full age and heirs to inherit God's promised blessing, and that we may mature in the divine sonship.</P><P>That Christ is being formed in us implies that we are being constituted of Christ. This is a living, organic matter. Christ is now living in us to constitute our entire being with Himself that every part of our soul&#151;mind, emotion, and will&#151;may be like Him. This is what 2 Corinthians 3:18 says, that we "are being transformed into the same image." The indwelling Christ is being formed in us; He is becoming our inner constituent. If we receive Christ as our person in our thinking, preference, and will, His element will gradually become our inner constituent. Eventually, our entire being will be constituted of the element of Christ. This is not merely a concept, theory, or theology. This is a divine fact that we can experience in full. As the living One, Christ with His element is becoming our constituent organically, being constituted into our entire being, so that we may have His form and express His image.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>34. The One Making His Home in Our Hearts</H2><P>The Christ who lives in us and who is being formed in us is also making His home in us. In Ephesians 3:17 Paul said, "That Christ may make His home in your hearts." Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul&#151;mind, emotion, and will&#151;plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit. These parts are the inward parts of our being. Through regeneration Christ came into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). After this, we should allow Him to spread into every part of our heart. Since our heart is the totality of all our inward parts and the center of our inward being, when Christ makes His home in our heart, He controls and occupies our entire inward being and supplies, strengthens, and saturates every inward part with Himself.</P><P>The Greek word for make home is composed of the word for down and the word for dwell. This indicates that Christ wants to make His home deep down in our being. When we were saved, Christ came into our spirit. Now we must give Him the opportunity to spread Himself throughout all the parts of our inner being. As we are strengthened into our inner man, the door is opened for Christ to spread in us, to spread from our spirit to our mind, emotion, will, and conscience. The more Christ spreads within us, the more He settles down in our hearts and makes His home in our hearts. As a result, we are filled with Christ unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19), which is the church, as the corporate expression of God for the fulfillment of His intention.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>35. The One Magnified in Us</H2><P>Christ is also the One magnified in us. In Philippians 1:20 Paul said, "According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death." This shows us that in the apostle's bodily sufferings, Christ was magnified, that is, shown or declared great (without limitation), exalted, and extolled. Paul's sufferings afforded him opportunity to express Christ in His unlimited greatness. No matter what the circumstances were, Paul would always magnify Christ.</P><P>The word magnify means to make something large to our sight. According to Ephesians 3, the dimensions of Christ&#151;the breadth, length, height, and depth&#151;are the dimensions of the universe. They are immeasurable. Since Christ is already universally great, why does He still need to be magnified? Although Christ is vast, extensive, and immeasurable, in the eyes of the praetorium, the imperial guard of Caesar, Christ was virtually non-existent. In their eyes there was not such a person as Jesus Christ. However, Paul, who was held captive in a Roman prison, magnified Christ among them. He made Christ great in their eyes, and he displayed especially to the jailers who guarded him the unlimited greatness of Christ. He became a living witness of Christ, testifying of Christ's love, wisdom, power, patience, etc., all of which are immeasurable. Through Paul's magnification of Christ, even some in Caesar's household turned to Christ and were saved (Phil. 4:22).</P><P>No matter what came upon him, Paul earnestly expected and hoped to magnify Christ in him. In his living, Paul lived Christ. This is to magnify Christ through life. As he was expecting to be martyred, he also lived Christ. This is to magnify Christ through death. Thus, whether through life or through death, Christ was magnified in Paul's body. Paul was not at all exhausted by his imprisonment; rather, he was full of joy and rejoicing in the Lord. No doubt he was shining forth Christ and expressing Him. Such an expression was a declaration of the unlimited greatness of Christ.</P><P>Now, as believers in Christ, we also should magnify Christ. As Christ lives in us, is being formed in us, and makes His home in us, spontaneously we will live Him. Then He will be magnified in us. In our daily life we must let others see Christ in the way of enlargement, in the way of magnification, that they may realize His unlimitedness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>36. The One Empowering Us</H2><P>Christ also is the One who empowers us. In Philippians 4:13 Paul said, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me." To be empowered is to be made dynamic inwardly. Christ dwells in us (Col. 1:27). He empowers us, makes us dynamic from within, not from without. By such inward empowering Paul was able to do all things in Christ.</P><P>Paul was a person in Christ (2 Cor. 12:2), and he desired to be found in Christ by others. Now he declared that he was able to do all things in Him, the very Christ who empowered him. This is an all-inclusive and concluding word of his experience of Christ. It is the converse of the Lord's word concerning our organic union with Him in John 15:5: "Apart from Me you can do nothing." According to Philippians 4, we know that what is spoken of here, that we are able to do all things in Christ, the One who empowers us, refers to our being able to live a contented life (vv. 11-12) and to live out the human virtues of Christ, such as to be true, to be dignified, to be righteous, to be pure, to be lovely, and to be well spoken of (v. 8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>Christ is the One who lives in us that we may live Him. He is not only life to us, the believers, but also a person living in us. His living in us is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit. Now we live because of Him by eating Him. Furthermore, we practice living Him in every detail of our life that we may be found in Him. He lives within us as our life, and we live Him without as His expression. Christ is also the One who is being formed in us. First, He was born into us, then He lives in us, and, finally, He will be formed in us at our maturity. Christ as the living One with His element is becoming organically the constituent within us that constitutes our entire being that we may have His form to express His image. He is also the One who makes His home in our hearts. He desires to dwell deeply in our entire being. He not only comes into our spirit but also spreads into every part of our heart, that He may control and occupy our entire inward being and that He may supply, strengthen, and saturate our every inward part with Himself. Thus, we are filled with Him unto all the fullness of God as God's corporate expression. Christ is also the One who is magnified in us. When we live Christ, express Christ, and display Christ's unlimited greatness, Christ is made great in others' eyes and is seen and realized as the One who is unlimited. He is also the One who empowers us. Christ dwells in us to empower us that we may be able to do all things in Him and to have a contented life and a life that lives out the human virtues of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>How does Christ live in us, and how can we live Him?</li><li>Briefly explain the significance of Christ's being formed in us.</li><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ's making His home in our hearts.</li><li>What does it mean to magnify Christ?</li><li>Briefly state the significance of our being able to do all things in Christ, the One who empowers us.</li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON THIRTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT<br>OF CHRIST AS THE SON<br>IN THE GRACE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(6)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>As our portion:	<ol class="decimal" start="37">	<li>The treasure with the excellent power.</li>	<li>The depths of God.</li>	<li>A model.</li>	<li>The Author and Perfecter of faith.</li>	<li>The Author of salvation.</li>	<li>The Forerunner.</li>	<li>The Apostle.</li>	<li>The High Priest.</li>	<li>The Husband.</li>	<li>The Bridegroom.</li>	</ol></li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>TEXT</H2><P>In this lesson we will continue to see Christ as the portion of the saints for our experience and enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>37. The Treasure with the Excellent Power</H2><P>Second Corinthians 4:6-7 says, "Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us." This shows that God's shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything. But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in worthless vessels! Furthermore, out of these vessels the excellency of the divine power will be made manifest. This excellency of the power is of God and not out of us.</P><P>The indwelling Christ as the treasure in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply of the Christian life. By the excellent power of this treasure we are able to experience the killing of the cross so that the resurrection life of Christ may be made manifest. Thus, we manifest the truth for the shining of the gospel. This is Christ as the treasure with the excellent power in the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>38. The Depths of God</H2><P>First Corinthians 2:10 says, "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God." According to the context of this verse, the depths of God refer to the deep things of God, which are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God. These deep things have never arisen in man's heart but are revealed to us in our spirit by God's Spirit. The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation. Hence, we must be spiritual in order to partake of them. We must move, act, and live in our spirit so that we may enjoy Christ as everything to us.</P><P>To know only that Christ is the Savior who died on the cross for our sins is superficial. But to know the depths of God, that is, to know Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, is deep and mysterious. Christ, the all-inclusive and extensive One, is the center of God's economy, the wisdom of God in a mystery, predestined by God before the ages for our glory (v. 7). He was God incarnated to be a perfect man. Through His death on the cross He terminated the old creation and released the divine life that it might be imparted to all those who believe in Him. Now, in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit and who has become one spirit with us. In our intimate fellowship with God, when we love Him and our entire being becomes one with Him, through His Spirit God will reveal in our spirit all the secrets of Christ as our allotted portion. Thus, we not only realize but also experience, enjoy, and fully participate in the deep and hidden things of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>39. A Model</H2><P>First Peter 2:21 says, "Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps." Here, the Greek word for model literally means "a writing copy, an under-writing (used by students to trace letters and thereby learn to draw them)." The Lord has set His suffering life before us as an under-writing so that we can copy it by tracing and following His steps. This does not refer to a mere imitation of Him and His life but to a reproduction of Him that comes from enjoying Him as grace in our sufferings, so that He Himself as the indwelling Spirit, with all the riches of His life, multiplies (reproduces) Himself in us. We need to become a reproduction of Him as the original writing-copy, not a mere imitation of Him by taking Him as our outward model.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>40. The Author and Perfecter of Faith</H2><P>Hebrews 12:2 says, "Looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith." The Greek word for author may also be rendered "originator," "inaugurator," "leader," "pioneer," "forerunner." Jesus is the Author of our faith. He is the Originator, the Inaugurator, the source, and the cause of our faith. In our natural man we have no believing ability. We do not have faith by ourselves. The faith by which we are saved is the precious faith that we have received from the Lord (2 Pet. 1:1). When we look unto Jesus, He as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) transfuses us with Himself, with His believing element. Then, spontaneously a kind of believing arises in our being, and we have the faith to believe in Him. This faith is not of ourselves but of Him who imparts Himself as the believing element into us that He may believe for us. Hence, the Lord Himself is our faith.</P><P>Once Christ has originated this faith within us, He will finish it. In this verse, the Greek word for perfecter may also be rendered "finisher," "completer." Jesus is the Finisher, the Completer, of faith. He will finish what He originated. He will complete what He inaugurated. He cut the way of faith and, as the Forerunner, He took the lead to pioneer it. Hence, He can carry us in His footsteps through the pathway of faith. He is the Originator of faith in His life and in His path on earth, and He is the Perfecter of faith in His glory and on His throne of glory. As we look to Him, turning away from other goals and gazing on Him with our full concentration, He transfuses and even infuses us with the faith that He originated and perfected until He will finish and complete the faith that we need for the running of the heavenly race.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>41. The Author of Salvation</H2><P>Hebrews 2:10 says, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings." The last step of God's great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory. In order to accomplish this, God needs an example, a model, to be the Author of salvation. Hence, He made Jesus perfect through sufferings. However, this does not mean that there was any imperfection of virtue or attribute in Jesus, but only that the completing of His experience of human sufferings was needed to make Him fit to become the Author, the Leader, of His followers' salvation. As the self-existing and ever-existing God, the Lord Jesus is complete from eternity to eternity. However, He needed to be perfected through the processes of incarnation, the partaking of human nature, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension that He might be qualified to be God's Christ and our Savior.</P><P>The salvation spoken of here saves us from our fallen state into glory. Jesus, as the Pioneer, the Forerunner (Heb. 6:20), took the lead to enter into glory, and we, His followers, are taking the same way to be brought into the same glory, which was ordained by God for us (1 Cor. 2:7; 1 Thes. 2:12). He cut the way, and we are now taking the way. Hence, He is not only the Savior who saved us from our fallen state but also the Author, the Pioneer, who took the lead to enter into glory that we may be brought into the same estate.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>42. The Forerunner</H2><P>Hebrews 6:19-20 says, "Which we have as an anchor of the soul, both secure and firm and which enters within the veil, where the Forerunner, Jesus, has entered for us, having become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec." Anchor signifies that we are on a stormy sea. As the Forerunner, the Lord Jesus took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and enter the heavenly haven. As such a Forerunner, He cut the way to glory. The heavens (4:14; 9:24), into which the Lord Jesus entered, are today the Holy of Holies within the veil. Our hope, as a secure and firm anchor, has entered there, and we may now enter there in our spirit (10:19-20). Therefore, we need to follow Him in our spirit and go on to enter the Holy of Holies that we may reach God's New Testament goal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>43. The Apostle</H2><P>Hebrews 3:1 says, "Consider the Apostle...of our confession, Jesus." The Apostle is the One who was sent to us from God and with God (John 6:46; 8:16, 29). As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness. This is typified by Moses, who came from God to serve the house of God. Christ as the Apostle was sent to take care of and to be over the house of God. In His humanity Christ is the good material for God's building, and in His divinity He is the Builder. He is not only a part of God's house; He is even the Builder of God's house. Today in the church as the house of God we may practically enjoy and experience Christ as such an Apostle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>44. The High Priest</H2><P>Hebrews 4:14 says, "Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession." The Lord Jesus first was sent from God to us through incarnation to be our Apostle, our Author, and our Leader. He then went back from us and with us to God through resurrection and ascension to be our High Priest to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs.</P><P>As our great High Priest, Christ is excellent, wonderful, glorious, and most honorable. He is great in His person, work, and attainment. He is the God-man, who is merciful and faithful (Heb. 2:17) and who is fully qualified to be our High Priest, continually ministering God and the riches of God's life to us. He was appointed the High Priest not according to the powerless letters of law but according to the powerful element of an indestructible life (7:16), which nothing can destroy or dissolve. This life is endless, being the eternal, divine, uncreated life and the resurrection life, which passed through the test of death and Hades (Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18). It is by such a life that Christ ministers today as our High Priest.</P><P>"Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them" (Heb. 7:25). Christ as our High Priest undertakes our case by interceding for us. He appears before God on our behalf and prays for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose. "For such a High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners and having become higher than the heavens" (v. 26). In His ascension Christ passed through the heavens, and He is higher than the heavens, far above all the heavens. Christ, as the High Priest in the heavens, brings us into heaven, from the earthly outer court into the heavenly Holy of Holies. As the One who ministers as a priest in heaven, Christ is the Minister of the heavenly tabernacle (Heb. 8:2), who ministers heaven (which is not only a place but also a condition of life) into us that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth, as He did while He was here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>45. The Husband</H2><P>In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul said, "For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ." Christ is the unique Husband to us, the believers, and we have been betrothed as a virgin to Him. Therefore, we should belong only to Him, and we should present ourselves to Him to love Him, to appreciate Him, and to enjoy Him as our life and everything. We should not allow anything to replace His position in our hearts. When our entire being is focused on Him, is attracted by Him, and is single and pure toward Him, we will be preserved and be sanctified unto Him and will enjoy Him as our unique portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>46. The Bridegroom</H2><P>Christ, our portion, is not only our Husband but also our Bridegroom. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist introduced the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God (1:29), who takes away the sin of the world, and as the Bridegroom, who has the bride (3:29) and who is the most pleasant One. Through regeneration we, the believers in Christ, not only receive the life of God and have the satanic nature in our flesh annulled, but also have become a corporate bride as Christ's counterpart for Christ's increase. As the unique, genuine Bridegroom in the universe, Christ is our attraction, delight, and satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>Christ to us is the treasure with the excellent power. He as the embodiment of God enters into us, the earthen vessels, to be our life and everything, and from these earthen vessels He will manifest the divine power of excellency. He is also the depths of God, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God as our eternal portion. He is also our model who, with all the riches of His life, is reproducing Himself in us that we may become His reproduction for His expression. He is also the Author and Perfecter of faith to transfuse us with the faith that He has originated and perfected until He finishes the faith that we need for the running of the heavenly race. He is also the Author of salvation, who was made perfect through sufferings and who took the lead to enter into glory. Now we, as His followers, are taking the same way and will be brought by Him into the same glory ordained by God for us. He is also the Forerunner, who took the lead to pass through the stormy sea and enter the heavenly haven, the Holy of Holies within the veil. Now we need to follow Him in our spirit and go on to enter the Holy of Holies that we may reach God's New Testament goal. He is also the Apostle, who came to us with God to share God with us that we may partake of His divine life, nature, and fullness. He is also the High Priest, who went back from us and with us to God to bear us in the presence of God and to care for all our needs. He is great, merciful, and faithful, and He is always living to intercede for us to save us to the uttermost. He is also our unique Husband; we should belong only to Him, love Him, appreciate Him, and enjoy Him as our life and everything. He is also the Bridegroom, and we, the believers in Christ, are the corporate bride. Hence, He is our attraction, delight, and satisfaction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Explain the issue of our experience of Christ as the treasure with the excellent power.</li><li>Briefly state the significance of Christ as our model.</li><li>How does Christ serve as the Author and Perfecter of our faith?</li><li>How does Christ serve as the Author of our salvation and the Forerunner?</li><li>Briefly state the relationship of Christ to us as the Apostle and the High Priest.</li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON THIRTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE EXPERIENCE AND ENJOYMENT<br>OF CHRIST AS THE SON<br>IN THE GRACE OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(7)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>As our portion:	<ol class="decimal" start="47">	<li>The Head.</li>	<li>The Lord.</li>	<li>The Master.</li>	<li>The Sovereign Master.</li>	<li>The Friend.</li>	<li>The Brother.</li>	<li>The Partner.</li>	<li>The Physician.</li>	<li>The Helper.</li>	<li>The Overseer.</li>	</ol></li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>TEXT</H2><P>In this lesson we will still continue to see the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son, the believers' portion, in the grace of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>47. The Head</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 11:3 the apostle Paul said, "I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man...and God is the head of Christ." Here the headship of Christ over every man pertains to individuals. In Ephesians 5:23 Paul also said that Christ is the Head of the church. Here the headship of Christ over His Body pertains to His Body. And in Ephesians 1:22-23 Paul said that Christ is the Head over all things. This pertains to all things. Therefore, Christ is the Head of every man, He is the corporate Head of the church, and He is the Head over all things that He may head up all things in Himself (Eph. 1:10).</P><P>Revelation 4 and 5 show us that Christ, the slain, resurrected, and ascended Lamb, is now in the heavens carrying out God's administration under God's headship. Satan takes the lead to rebel against God, and the whole earth is filled with rebellion. But in the midst of all this rebellion, Christ has gained a group of people who have been redeemed and baptized into the Triune God, and He has constituted them to be the Body of Christ. As the Body, they are freed from rebellion and are subjected under the headship of God. Just as Christ is in the heavens submitting to God's headship for the carrying out of the divine administration, so we the believers and the church, which is constituted with us, should also submit ourselves to Christ as the Head, honor Him as our Head, and express His submission to God's headship for the carrying out of the divine administration. When we thus take Christ as our Head and submit ourselves under His headship, we participate in and enjoy His headship.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>48. The Lord</H2><P>As believers, we have Christ as our Lord. Romans 14:8 says, "For whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore whether we live or we die, we are the Lord's." All believers are the Lord's. All have been born of the same God, all belong to the Lord, and all have the same Lord regardless of how much they differ in doctrinal concepts or in religious practices. Since Christ is our Lord, we should not judge any brother in the Lord by ourselves; rather, we should receive one another, for we neither are qualified nor have the position to pass judgment on anyone. If we truly know Christ as our Lord and as the Lord of all the believers, we will fear Him, honor Him, and take Him as our unique Lord.</P><P>In Ephesians 1:17 Paul speaks of "our Lord Jesus Christ." This indicates that this Christ as the Lord belongs to us and is our portion. We should not only recognize Jesus Christ as the Lord; we should enjoy Him as our Lord, more personally and more intimately. To say that He is the Lord of all things and of all people is general; to say that He is our Lord is specific. We should experience and enjoy Him specifically as our Lord in our experience of salvation and our Christian life that we may experience all the benefits of His lordship over us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>49. The Master</H2><P>In Ephesians 6:5-9 Paul's word concerning the relationship between slaves and masters reveals that Christ is the Master of the believers. Paul exhorted the slaves to obey their masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of their heart, as to Christ. Fear is the inward motive for service, and trembling is the outward attitude. To be single is to be pure in motive, without a mixed purpose. Slaves are to be single; they are not to have a double purpose. This means that slaves are not to serve their masters with the intention of receiving some gain for themselves. Here the relationship between slaves and masters is a type of our relationship with Christ, our Master. We should obey Him, the unique Master, as slaves in singleness of heart that we may enjoy Him as our Master in His caring for us in different ways.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>50. The Sovereign Master</H2><P>Christ is also the Sovereign Master to the believers. Second Peter 2:1 says that Christ is the Master who bought us. This implies Christ's person as the Master and His redemption, by which He purchased the believers. Jude 4 also says, "Our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ." The Greek word translated "Master" in this verse denotes one who is the absolute owner and who has unlimited power over another. By purchasing us back through His redemption, Christ becomes our Sovereign Master, having absolute sovereignty and unlimited power over us. His sovereignty and power also become a blessing to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>51. The Friend</H2><P>The Lord's word in John 15:15 reveals that He is a Friend to the believers. The Lord said, "No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all the things which I have heard from My Father I have made known to you." This verse was spoken by the Lord after He had spoken the word concerning the intimate relationship between the branches with the vine. This shows us that the relationship between the vine and the branches is not a relationship between a master and his slaves. Rather, it is a relationship between friends. The vine and the branches are an entity that bears fruit to glorify God. The branches are the friends of the Lord as the vine, and the Lord is a Friend to them. What the Lord has heard from the Father He has made known to His friends. They know that the Father's desire is for Him to be expressed, glorified, in a corporate Body. In such a friendship, spontaneously we have a taste of the Lord's affection toward us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>52. The Brother</H2><P>As believers, we also have Christ as our Brother. He is the elder Brother, and we are the many brothers. Romans 8:29 says, "Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers." This indicates that God's purpose is to prepare and produce many brothers for His firstborn Son that, on the one hand, they, together with God's firstborn Son, may be the many sons of God with the divine life and nature for the expression of God, and that, on the other hand, they may be the many members who constitute the Body of God's firstborn Son as the corporate expression of God in His firstborn Son, which is the fullness of the firstborn Son of God, that is, the fullness of God in His firstborn Son (Eph. 1:23; 3:19).</P><P>Christ was the only begotten Son of God from eternity (John 1:18), and up to the time He was sent by God into the world, He was still the only begotten Son of God (1 John 4:9; John 1:14; 3:16). After He passed through death and entered into resurrection, His humanity was uplifted into His divinity. Thus, He was begotten in resurrection as God's firstborn Son in His divinity with His humanity that had died and resurrected (Acts 13:33). At the same time, all His believers were raised together with Him in His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3) and were begotten together with Him as the many sons of God. Thus they became His many brothers to constitute His Body and be God's corporate expression in Him.</P><P>On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus said to Mary, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (John 20:17). Before His resurrection the Lord never called His disciples brothers. But after His resurrection He began to call them brothers. Through His death and resurrection He released the divine life and imparted it into His disciples. Thus, they were regenerated to become the many sons of God as the many brothers of Christ. By making His Father theirs, He brought them into His position&#151;the position of the Son&#151;before the Father. Thus, in life and nature inwardly and in position outwardly they are one with Him.</P><P>Hebrews 2:11 says, "Both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers." He who sanctifies is Christ as the firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. Both the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God are born of the same Father God in resurrection and have the same divine life and nature. Hence, He is not ashamed to call them brothers. Furthermore, because He is our elder Brother, He is our leading One. He takes the lead in everything that pertains to God the Father that we as the many brothers may enjoy Him as the elder Brother in His leading.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>53. The Partner</H2><P>Christ is also our Partner. Hebrews 1:9 says, "God...has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners." In God's economy Christ is the One appointed by God to accomplish God's plan, and we are Christ's partners in the divine interest. He was anointed by God, and we share with Him in this anointing for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</P><P>Hebrews 3:14 says, "We have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end." The context of this verse concerns the wandering of the children of Israel in the wilderness. After they wandered in the wilderness for forty years, God caused Joshua to bring them into the good land. When Joshua entered into the good land, Caleb was his companion, his partner, in entering into and possessing the good land (Num. 14:30). Today Christ is the real Joshua, and we are His Calebs, His partners, sharing with Him the rest of the good land. Therefore, in God's economy we are partners of Christ, sharing with Him the spiritual anointing and the rest of the good land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>54. The Physician</H2><P>The Lord is also the Physician to us. In Matthew 9:12 the Lord said, "Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill." This indicates that in calling people to follow Him, He ministered as a physician, not as a judge. A judge's judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician's healing is according to mercy and grace. If the Lord had visited us, the pitiful people, as a judge, we all would have been condemned and rejected, and none of us would have been qualified, selected, and called to be His followers. However, He came to minister as a physician, to heal, recover, enliven, and save us that we may have the life of God and be constituted the members of the Body of Christ.</P><P>As our Physician, the Lord heals us mainly in our spirit and our soul, and sometimes in our body. Those who were ill, whom the Lord mentioned, refer to the tax collectors and sinners who were feasting with Him. They were not physically sick; they were spiritually sick. Because of the healing by the Lord as the heavenly Physician, their life was recovered. Likewise, although the Lord may or may not heal us in our body, He is always ready to heal us in every part of our spirit and soul. Christ is our Physician, the Healer of our spirit, our soul, and, at times, our body. When we experience and enjoy Him as our portion, we receive His healing of life to take away our sickness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>55. The Helper</H2><P>The Lord is also a Helper to us, the believers. Hebrews 13:5 says that we should let our way of life be without the love of money, being satisfied with the things which are at hand, for the Lord will by no means give us up, neither by any means will He abandon us. Therefore, being of good courage, we say, "The Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear" (v. 6). This chapter is concerned with the virtues for the church life. Surely money lovers cannot enter into the reality of the church life. We should always be satisfied with what we have so that we cannot be distracted from the church life by mammon. Since we have the Lord as our Helper, we should be content and at peace. Since the Lord knows our needs, He will take care of the needs in our living. Our life is in Him, and our living is in His hands. Therefore, we need not fear; we need only to trust in Him as our Helper that we may be kept fully in the enjoyment of the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>56. The Overseer</H2><P>To us, the believers, the Lord is also an Overseer. First Peter 2:25 says, "You were like sheep being led astray, but you have now returned to the...Overseer of your souls." The Greek word for overseer is composed of "over" and "seer"; hence, overseer. This word seems to indicate someone above us who takes oversight concerning us and watches over us. However, the Lord as our Overseer does not mainly watch over us or rule over us. Rather, He shepherds us and takes care of us. This is like a mother caring for her child, taking care of every need of her child in a complete and gentle way. The same is true of Christ as the Overseer of our souls. Our soul is our inner being, our real person. Christ as the Overseer of our souls cares for the welfare of our inner being and exercises His oversight over the condition of our real person, and according to the need of our real person He shepherds us that we may be under His regular care and protection all the time and in everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>SUMMARY</H2><P>As our portion, Christ is our Head. He is the Head of every man, the corporate Head of the church, and the Head over all things. He is also the Lord to us, the believers. All believers are the Lord's. Therefore, we should not judge any brother in the Lord; rather, we should receive one another. We should not only recognize Jesus Christ as the Lord; we should enjoy Him as our Lord, more personally and more intimately. He is also our Master. We should obey Him, the unique Master, as slaves in singleness of heart that we may enjoy Him as our Master, who cares for us in different ways. He is also our Sovereign Master. Therefore, He has absolute sovereignty and unlimited power over us. He is also our Friend, and He makes known to us the Father's desire. He is also our Brother. In life and nature inwardly and in position outwardly we are one with Him. He is also our Partner in the divine interest. He was anointed by God, and we share with Him in this anointing for the fulfillment of God's purpose. He is also our Physician. He heals, recovers, enlivens, and saves us so that we may have the life of God and be constituted the members of the Body of Christ. He is also our Helper. He knows all our needs and will take care of the needs in our living. He is also the Overseer of our souls. By caring for the welfare of our inner being and exercising His oversight over the condition of our real person, He shepherds us that we may be under His care and protection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>What are the three aspects of Christ as the Head?</li><li>What are the two aspects of our experience of Christ as our Lord?</li><li>How did Christ become our elder Brother?</li><li>Briefly state the significance of the fact that in God's economy we are Christ's partners.</li><li>Briefly explain how Christ is our Overseer.</li></ol></body></html>
