<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Consummating the Spirit of God<br>to Be the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>Christ first became a man, and that man was born to be God's firstborn Son. Also, millions of God's chosen people were born with Him to be God's many sons. In the same resurrection, this wonderful Christ also became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The life-giving Spirit is the Spirit of Christ&#151;the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ (Rom. 8:9). The life-giving Spirit is also the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God, who is embodied in the pneumatized Christ realized as the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the reality of resurrection, which is Christ Himself and the processed and consummated Triune God (John 11:25; 1 John 5:6). The resurrection is Christ and the consummated Triune God. And this resurrection is the Spirit.</P><P>We need to see that in the all-conquering resurrection of Christ, three major things transpired. First, the man Jesus was born to be the firstborn Son of God. Second, all His believers were born in that birth with Him to be the many sons of God. One delivery produced the firstborn Son and millions of "twins." We are the "twins" of Christ. We are His "twin" brothers, born by one delivery. Of course, He took the lead to come out, and we followed Him. First Peter 1:3 says that all the believers in Christ were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ. Third, at the time when Christ in His humanity was born to be the firstborn Son of God, He became the life-giving Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE ALL-TRANSCENDING ASCENSION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Transcending Four Layers of Opposition</H2><P>Christ in His ascension transcended Hades (where the dead people are being held), the earth (where the fallen men are moving against God), the air (where Satan and his power of darkness are acting against God), and all the heavens (where Satan can go). Christ transcended these four layers (Eph. 1:20-21; 4:8-10; Heb. 4:14; 7:26). Hades is the first layer, below the earth where the dead people are held. The earth is where the fallen men are moving against God. The air is where Satan and his power of darkness are struggling against God. The third heaven is a good place, but Satan even has a way to go to that good place (Job 1:6-12a; 2:1-6). In Christ's ascension He transcended these four layers. Today He is not only above Hades, the earth, and the air, but also above the third heaven. He is higher than all the heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. To Be Transmitted into the Church</H2><P>Such a transcending Christ is to be transmitted into the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22-23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Be the Head of the Body, the Church</H2><P>In His ascension He is the Head of the Body, the church, having the first place in all things (Col. 1:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Be Made Lord, Christ, Leader, and Savior</H2><P>In His ascension this One was made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36) and the Leader (of all the kings) and Savior (5:31). If He were not the Ruler, the Leader, of all the kings, He could not be the Savior. He is the Ruler of all the kings, so He can manage the environment for all of God's chosen people to be saved. I was saved in China. If in history God had not managed the world affairs to have some saints from the West go to the Far East to preach the gospel, I could never have been saved. For the British and Americans to go to my country to preach the gospel needed much work by God. That was a great management. Sometimes the management is small, but only God can carry this out to create the proper environment for people to be saved. Thus, He is the Ruler of all the kings so that He can be the Savior to save God's chosen people.</P>
