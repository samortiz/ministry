   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE PARTS OF MAN AS THE VESSEL OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Jer 31:33; Heb 8:10; Psa 51:6; 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; Luke 1:46-47; Phil 1:27; Mark 12:30</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will continue to see the details of the parts of man as the vessel of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen clearly that God's intention is to work Himself into us to be our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, He has to be our content.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this purpose, God created us as His vessels with many parts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word parts is not a term used only by us; rather, it is in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jeremiah 31:33 says, "But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the phrase within them, both the King James Version and the American Standard Version render it as "in their inward parts."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The outward parts are the members of our body, but within our body there are the inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to know what these inward parts are.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hebrews 8:10, a quotation of Jeremiah 31:33, says, "I will impart My laws into their mind."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The inward parts in Jeremiah 31 becomes "their mind" in Hebrews 8.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the mind is one of the many inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Psalm 51:6 says, "Behold, You delight in truth in the inward parts; / And in the hidden part You would make known wisdom to me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here again we see the inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Besides these, there is also the hidden part.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Truth is in the inward parts, but wisdom is in the hidden part.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must find out what the inward parts and the hidden part are.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>MAN BEING OF DIFFERENT PARTS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Thessalonians 5:23 tells us that we are tripartite, of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse gives us the right order of these three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It says "spirit and soul and body," not "body and soul and spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The following diagram illustrates the parts of man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows us that the spirit and the soul can and must be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to know Christ and enter into Him as our rest and good land, we have to discern our spirit from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spirit is the very place where Christ dwells in us 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are going to know Christ in an experiential way, we must learn to divide our human spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Luke 1:46 and 47 say, "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has exulted in God my Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here again there is a difference between the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Philippians 1:27 speaks of standing firm in one spirit and striving with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This one spirit is not the Holy Spirit but our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this verse also we see a difference between the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hebrews 4:12 not only speaks of the dividing of spirit and soul; it also mentions the joints and the marrow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Joints and marrow are something of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse also speaks of the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even in the heart there is also the difference between the thoughts and the intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Mark 12:30 says, "And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This verse speaks of four parts: the heart, the soul, the mind, and the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All these parts have to be discerned by the living Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This proves that in order to know the Lord in a practical and real way, we have to discern all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must know the thoughts of the heart, the intentions of the heart, and all the many parts of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The soul is of three parts, and the spirit also has three parts, or functions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to know the three parts of the soul and the three parts of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, we also should know what the heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Thessalonians 5:23 speaks of our whole being, telling us that we are tripartite spirit, soul, and body but it says nothing about the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we must see what the heart is, what it is composed of, and how we can locate it with respect to the inward parts and the hidden part.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we put all these verses together, we can realize that there are many different inward parts within the many outward parts of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What are these parts?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to 1 Thessalonians 5:23, within the body we have a soul and a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Psalm 51 tells us that we have the inward parts with the hidden part.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to Jeremiah 31 and Hebrews 8, the mind is one of the inward parts, and as we shall see, the mind is a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the inward parts must be all the parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The hidden part must be the spirit, because our spirit is hidden within all our other parts; it is the inmost part hidden, not within the body, but within even the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In summary, we have the outward part of the body, the inward parts of the soul, and the spirit as the hidden part.</S>
