   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. To Worship the Father 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By Becoming the Father's Children</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are to worship the Father, we first need to be reborn, becoming the Father's children John 1:12; 1 John 3:1a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By Knowing the Father's Name</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 17:26a the Lord said that He would make the Father's name known to His disciples, and in Hebrews 2:12a we see that He declares the Father's name to His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The name denotes the person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you call on someone's name, the person comes, so the name of the Father denotes the Father's person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is not only our God who created us but also the Father who begets us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is not only the creating God but also the begetting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we are not only His creatures but also His children born of Him, begotten by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is our Father, and we have to know His person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To know His person is to know His name.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the disciples at that time had a Jewish background.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They had the concept concerning God as their Creator, but they did not have any concept about God being their begetting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before the Lord's resurrection, they did not have the concept that they were to be the children of God with God's life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before His resurrection, it was hard for the Lord to declare the Father's person to the disciples, because they did not have God as their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the resurrection He imparted the divine life into the disciples, so that made it easy for Him to make the Father's name, the Father's person, known to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the day of His resurrection, He told Mary, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The words brothers and your Father indicate an experience of life, a relationship in life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His resurrection, the Lord imparted the Father's life and nature into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now His Father is their Father and they are His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is all implied in knowing the Father's name, His person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By Enjoying the Father's Presence</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We worship the Father by enjoying the Father's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John 14:23 the Lord said, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Father and the Son will come to the one who loves the Son and will make Their abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the constant presence of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we say, "Abba, Father" Rom 8:15; Gal 4:6 , we have a sweet inward sensation in an intimate enjoyment of the Father's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By becoming the Father's children, by knowing the Father's name, and by enjoying the Father's presence, we worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are not born of the Father, do not know His person, and do not have His presence, we cannot worship Him subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can only worship an objective God.</S>
