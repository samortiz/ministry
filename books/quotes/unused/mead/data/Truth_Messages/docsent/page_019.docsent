   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX MOVING INTO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE SANCTIFIED FOR ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to have the genuine oneness, we need to be separated from worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinions and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past not many of us realized that we need to be sanctified to have the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sanctification has a great deal to do with oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we shall again consider chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although Christians have read these chapters again and again, not many know the real meaning of them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chapters fourteen through sixteen are the last words of the Lord Jesus to His disciples before His betrayal and crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After uttering the words recorded in these chapters, He offered the prayer found in chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This prayer is actually a conclusion to His speaking in the previous three chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A PLACE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 14:2 the Lord Jesus says, In My Father s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you read this verse in the light of the whole New Testament, you will see that the house here refers to the church, not to the so-called heavenly mansions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter two of John the house refers firstly to the temple and secondly to the body of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as the temple was the house of God, so the Lord s physical body was the house of God when the Lord was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After Christ s resurrection, His physical body became the mystical Body, which is the house of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This mystical Body, the Body of Christ, is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus was about to die, He told His disciples that He was going to prepare a place for them in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that He was about to prepare a place for us in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, in the beginning of this section of the Gospel of John, the Lord said clearly that His going was for the purpose of accomplishing one thing: to prepare a place for us in the house of God, the church, and to pave the way for us to be brought into this place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>IN THE FATHER AND IN THE GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 14:3 says, And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord was in the Father, and He wanted His disciples to be in the Father also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this verse the Lord seemed to be saying, I am in the Father, but you are not.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By My crucifixion and resurrection, I shall bring you into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then where I am, you will be also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord prayed for this very thing in John 17:24: Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me may also be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me, for You have loved Me before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to this verse, eventually we shall be not only in the Father, but also in the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Firstly, the Lord brings us into the Father and then into the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>MOVING OUT OF OURSELVES BY BEING SANCTIFIED</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we are with the Lord in the Father and in the glory, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when we are in ourselves, we cannot be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In ourselves we are one only with ourselves, not with anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we desire to be one with others, we need to move out of the self and into God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No one can make this move for us; we are responsible to do it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we move out of ourselves and into the Father and into the Father s glory, we are one and are even perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The way to make this move is by being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be sanctified is to make the move out of ourselves and into the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we remain in ourselves, we are not sanctified and thus we cannot be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In ourselves we have worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is impossible for us to eradicate these things from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you realize that the world is actually yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The same is true of ambition, self-exaltation, and opinions and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the reason we cannot escape from these four things if we stay in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Paul told the Corinthians that among them there was envy, strife, and division 1 Cor 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These are some of the characteristics of those who are in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church life, however, is a building, and the real building is the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this genuine oneness there is no room for worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, or opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How can we remove these four things from us?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In ourselves, it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no way for us to eliminate them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As fallen people we are constituted with worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even little children know how to exalt themselves; at an early age they also become ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, children do not need to be taught worldliness, for they are worldly by nature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As long as we are alive, we are subject to worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although some of us are gentle and meek because of our natural disposition, this does not mean that we are not ambitious or opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With some, ambition is expressed in an outward way and is quite obvious, whereas with others, ambition is a hidden matter concealed in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But everyone is ambitious; ambition is a constituent of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord Jesus knows our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In John 15:5 He said, Apart from Me you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is the vine, and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must remain in Him, that is, abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To remain in Christ as the vine means that we move out of ourselves and into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since the Lord is in the Father, we also may be in the Father by being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In John 17:21 the Lord prayed, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the oneness in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to be in the Triune God, we must move out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>John 17:22 says, And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we move out of ourselves and remain in the Triune God, Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way we are perfected into one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only by our being sanctified can we abide in Christ and can Christ live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Again I say, to be sanctified is to move out of ourselves and into the Triune God and to allow Christ to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>According to chapters fourteen through seventeen of John, this is the proper concept of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The more we are sanctified, the more we are out of ourselves and in the Triune God.</S>
