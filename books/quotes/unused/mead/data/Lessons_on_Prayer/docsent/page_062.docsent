   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. DEALINGS OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is very hard to always maintain our life before the Lord in a trouble-free condition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Usually, and unconsciously, our life within incurs some problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once this happens, immediately we are not able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, you may have a controversy with the Lord regarding a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You refuse to obey the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, you insist on acting according to your own will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once such a controversy exists, there is a problem in your life, and you cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if you do pray, your prayers are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You must resolve this controversy by saying to the Lord, "Lord, I will let You win again in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am willing to be defeated by You."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At this point the prayer in you can be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not only controversies that cause problems in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even speaking a few unnecessary words in our daily life can affect our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, we must deal strictly with all the things that may affect our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must always adjust the condition of our inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nothing restricts and controls man more severely than prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do not pray for a week, you will surely be very far from the Lord and become completely loose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One who prays much every day is, without question, fully restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may do as you please in everything but prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, the Lord's teaching shows us that when we pray we need to forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we do not forgive others, we cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is because of this that some, at times, have been unable to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although they may sometimes speak words of prayer, they know very well that they are not really before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They know that there is a separation, a distance, between them and God, for they have not been able to forgive their brother.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means their life has incurred some problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, you need to learn the lessons of prayer by dealing with your inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You will notice that you not only will be able to learn a great deal in prayer, but you will have daily growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No other activity requires the supply of life more than prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither is there anything else that can cause a Christian to grow faster than prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>LIVING IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To learn to pray, we must learn first to continually live in life and not depart from it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to follow the consciousness of life and live in the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever we depart from life, we have no way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those who pray the most and who are the most thorough and weighty in prayer are those who continually live in life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The lesson of prayer is absolutely a spiritual matter, a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regardless how much you have learned, it always involves the spirit and revolves around life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the lessons of life are here in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, if we wish to learn the lessons of prayer, we need to be one who lives in life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, let us consider a gospel meeting in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you attend such a meeting there are several possibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may feel that since this is the church preaching the gospel, it is imperative that you, as a brother or sister serving God, participate.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore you attend the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Another possibility may be that the elders keep telling you that this gospel preaching really needs you, and it is imperative that you come.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then, feeling you have no choice, you come.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Please remember, these are not examples of living in life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And since your reason for attending is not in life, you are not able to offer much prayer for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The situation should be such that in your spirit you feel very much concerned for the gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then, spontaneously, you will be able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, brothers, in order to pray you need to learn to live in life in every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The same is true concerning the relationships you have with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may have various reasons to maintain your relationship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But unless those reasons are in life, they can never cause you to pray for the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You and I need to learn severe lessons and condemn anything that is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How do you know what is of life?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have to ask whether there is prayer or not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If your relationship with the brothers and sisters is of life, you will pray a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not because the brothers or sisters ask you to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is because your relationship with them is of life, so you cannot keep from praying for them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If it is not of life, even if you intend to pray, you will not feel the urgency in your inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, you will simply forget it after a time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, please remember: where life is, there is prayer; where life is not, there is no prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we do not live in life, even our prayer for our relatives cannot last long.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can only pray once, and that is all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only in life can there be the real, lasting prayers.</S>
