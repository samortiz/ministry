   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RULING OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every part of a believer's being needs to be kept under control.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The same is true with the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This should not be ignored even after the mind has been renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must never allow our mind to be as free as it wishes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Otherwise, evil spirits will come and take it over again.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to realize that our thoughts are the seeds of our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are not careful in our thoughts, it will not be long before we fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the seed of a thought has been planted, we do not know when it will grow, but sooner or later it will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we carefully trace all the intentional or unintentional transgressions we have committed, we will always find that they were the fruit of previous thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we let a sinful thought remain in our head without getting rid of it, some time later, even years later, it will become a sinful act.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, if we have a bad thought about a brother and do not remove it immediately, it will bear fruit, even though we know that it is wrong and have asked God for forgiveness!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All improper thoughts will certainly produce improper conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, believers can ill-afford not to deal thoroughly with all their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a person cannot keep his thoughts under control, he will find out that he is not able to control anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is why Peter said, "Girding up the loins of your mind" 1 Pet 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that we need to control our thoughts and not let them run wild.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's purpose is to bring "every thought unto the obedience of Christ" 2 Cor 10:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, believers should consider every one of their thoughts under the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not allow any thought to run away from our jurisdiction or escape our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every kind of thought has to go through our own examination and be under our own control.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While we are controlling our thoughts, we should make certain that no improper thoughts remain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All improper thoughts should be driven out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A believer should not let his mind become lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that he has to apply his thoughts to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He should be a spiritual person with a full consciousness, not allowing his thoughts to remain stagnant or become loose.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he does, evil spirits will seize the opportunity for their work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His mind should not be lazy and without any work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It should always be active.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even after he receives a revelation in his spirit, he still should exercise his thought mind .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not think that after he has a revelation in his spirit he can act accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He must apply his mind to examine and consider what he is about to do and find out if there is still any self-intention, anything not according to God, and anything that proceeds from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Is his behavior fully according to the spirit and fully according to God's timing, or is there still something from the self?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of consideration will help the spirit to further brighten the revelation in the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If it is not God's revelation, it will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A mind centered on the self will prevent us from realizing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very helpful to disregard our thoughts that are centered on the self.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God does not want us to follow blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He wants us to apprehend His will clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Anything which is not thoroughly apprehended is not reliable.</S>
