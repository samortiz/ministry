   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THOSE NATURALLY ACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A word now to those who are so accustomed to open their mouths in a natural way in the meetings: I beg you to be somewhat restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not believe the Lord is so happy to listen to you, because you are so used to speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am afraid that may be a kind of strange fire Lev 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, those who are so quiet and dumb must open their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I do believe the opening of their mouths is a real joy to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord will say, Look, a dumb child is opening his mouth!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a wonder and a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So we must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You know where you stand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are accustomed to opening your mouth in a natural way, learn to be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Give more opportunity to those who are usually quiet to enter in and participate in the praise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you are not accustomed to opening your mouth, learn to open it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, we all must take responsibility to go on without undue hesitation and waiting; yet we must still care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now let us consider some examples of meetings and make a few remarks regarding them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose that we come together and are not quite clear what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One may begin, Lord, we thank Thee for the meeting tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then another may say, It is good to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not too bad, but we must go on from this to uplift the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may say, Lord, we meet together with Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then someone else may continue, With Thee as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From this you will turn to something further till you hit some point.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That point will probably coincide with the current flow in the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose that the flow is the victory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It may be good then to use Psalm 68.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This will further uplift the meeting and release the praises.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose now that you have begun your meeting with the subject of newness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning this matter, you must realize, there is very little Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With the doctrine of newness, you can finish in two sentences, and you may just find yourself repeating, newness, newness, newness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So here you need the experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without experiences you will be tongue-tied, but with them, you will have many things to say.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need to restrict ourselves to the doctrine in such a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe many of us do have the experiences, but we have not learned how to apply them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is better to give short testimonies telling how new Christ is according to your experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Two or three sentences is sufficient; you need not give a long testimony this will kill the praising.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then others will follow to praise, taking your testimony as a base.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Someone else may then share a further testimony regarding his experience of the Lord s newness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At a certain point we will need a proper hymn to match the praise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the singing some will continue to praise according to the wording of the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later we may need a chorus as an insertion to uplift the meeting even further.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There should not be any rules or forms.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all must learn to be so alive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should certainly not be praising the Lord for His newness and yet our way of praising be old.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now suppose that in our meeting we have taken up the matter of the greatness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a good point, but there is still not much doctrine here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet you may have many things to say.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One may rise and say, Look at the universe; how great God is!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Another may say, Look at the millions of saints in the earth; how great God is!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then another may say, Look at all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>See how all the saints are being built up together in love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How great God is!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually someone may exclaim, Look at us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>See how He is building us up here as the local church in this place.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How great God is!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This will release a volume of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the meeting has reached the climax, we may then sing the hymn, How great Thou art!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will all be in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Another meeting may begin with praising about the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here you have one of the richest and fullest of subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are many doctrines regarding His name, and, of course, it is so easy to release some testimonies on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But we need the skill.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>With such a subject, before we get into the various aspects and our experiences concerning it, we need to give some kind of definition, some kind of exposition of the name.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Someone may then follow by saying that the name of Jesus is a mighty name.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is one aspect, but to mention the aspect of mightiness first is not so fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is better first to speak of the sweetness of the name.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The name of Jesus is so sweet sweet to us in this way and sweet to us in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We could continue our praising of the name of the Lord for one hundred days and not be exhausted, but we need the skill.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may then turn from the sweetness to the mightiness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The sweet name is the mighty name.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are many doctrines and many hymns and choruses that we can use to enrich our praising in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We need the practice till we acquire the skill.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In still another meeting we may praise the Lord for His house.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This also is an excellent subject: it is exceedingly rich and easy to deal with even easier than the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yet we all need more skill.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we have entered into a subject like this, we need time first of all to define what the house is.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then we need to point out in our praises the goodness of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>From there we may go on from one aspect to another, matching each one with our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Of course, there are many songs and choruses we may use to enrich the praise.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now I do believe that we all have the idea.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need more and more practice, however, that we may obtain a better coordination one with another and render the best cooperation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we learn to meet together in this way with the proper skill, our meetings will be so sweet, so rich, so inspiring, and so edifying.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They will be much more effective than the meetings merely with teachings and messages.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>THE INSTANT ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Every time we come to the meetings, we must come fully open to the Lord, not knowing just how the meeting will be carried on.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is no need to decide that tonight we will praise the Lord for His name or His victory or some other topic.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>That does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There is no need to make up our mind in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In fact, we should not bring anything to the meeting according to our head knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>That will damage; that will bring death; that we must forsake.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Forget about making up your mind in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Just keep yourself in the Lord s fellowship; just keep yourself open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Perhaps at the moment you enter the meeting place you will instantly receive a certain sense deep within you.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Just utter that; just follow that.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You may never have dreamed of this when you were home; it is so new, so instant, so up-to-date.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It may be a sense of the exceeding goodness of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Then you can immediately praise the Lord, O Lord, how good You are!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Just praise the Lord according to the instant sense in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>All the others will then coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>One has begun, and we will all cooperate to play the same ball.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then the meeting is started.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The meetings in this day of the spirit should have no regulations, forms, or particular trends to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We all must be fully open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>A WAY IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The new way of meeting is a way in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is not according to the teachings or doctrines of the Bible of course, it is not contrary to the clear words of Scripture , but absolutely according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Do not say, We must act in such and such a way according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In a sense I agree with you, but I tell you, that will kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The written code kills.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It is rather difficult to find a verse in the Bible telling us to walk according to the Word, but there are several verses instructing us to walk according to the Spirit e.g., Rom 8:4 and Gal 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must be clear, I say again, that if we walk according to the Spirit, we will certainly not act in contradiction to the Word; everything will correspond to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>But the Spirit must be the leading, controlling factor.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Do you see the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Merely taking the Word in letter and seeking to walk according to it will kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>For seven years I was with a group that attempted this, and I know too well the resulting death.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The Bible tells us that we must walk according to the Spirit, without anything in opposition to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We all must learn, therefore, how to exercise our spirit, release our spirit, strengthen our spirit, and demonstrate our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Then the Lord will be exhibited, the Father will be glorified, the saints will be edified, and the church will be built up in a practical way in the locality where we live.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Practice this above all, and you will be ready for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>We must lay the foundation of the meetings in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Once the foundation has been laid, it will be so easy for the newly saved ones and newcomers to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>May the Lord be gracious to us that He may have a full recovery.</S>
