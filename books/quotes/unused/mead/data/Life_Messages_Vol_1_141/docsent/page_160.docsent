   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REPENTING FOR OUR GOOD BEHAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the early days of my Christian life I repented many times for my sins, weaknesses, and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now, however, most of my repentance is for being short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A number of times after I have been with the brothers and treated them in a courteous, humble way, I have gone to the Lord to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was humble, but I was short of You.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The brothers appreciated me and thought I was nice, but I did not minister any Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Forgive me, Lord, that I did not live You."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Have you ever repented that you are short of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You love others, but there is no Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You behave properly, but there is no Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may have repented for not honoring your parents or for other wrongdoing, but you need a higher repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You need to repent of your goodness, or of the humility you have practiced, outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may have been born humble.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You live out your humility, but you have not lived out Christ; you are short of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church life is not a life of good behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is the Body of Christ, not the body of love, humility, or patience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because we are His Body, what we are must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My physical body expresses only me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Body of Christ must express only Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The love in the church must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The same is true of every other virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To see this is to have a revelation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This vision will make you hate your love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You will reject your patience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You will condemn your humility.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not to say that you will be hateful, impatient, and proud.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No, it means that you will live only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You will not know love or patience or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You will know only Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once you have seen life, you will hate what is good but not life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many men love their wives, but it is not Christ who is the love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our love must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are truly seeking after the Lord, the day will come when you will see that what God desires is not your doing, your behavior, or your virtues, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is to be your living, your daily walk, your everything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day, after I had been saved a number of years, Brother Nee asked me, "What is patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I did not know how to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Finally he said, "Patience is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Patience is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It sounded like a foreign language.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I knew what patience was, but I did not know how to answer his question.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then when he said that patience is Christ, I could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I was not educated that way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In these years, however, since 1962, I have ministered along this line many times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have learned that many in the churches do not have this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They may have some knowledge about it, but knowledge does not affect you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As Proverbs 29:18 says, "Where there is no vision, the people run wild" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A vision controls, but knowledge does not.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not enough to know that Christ is life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You need to see this as a vision which governs your life.</S>
