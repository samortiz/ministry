   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE UNIQUE PLACE FOR GOD S NAME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND FOR GOD S HABITATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we pointed out in the last message, the Bible gives us a wonderful picture in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we go on to consider the unique place for God s name and for His habitation, we need to review this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The whole revelation of the Bible indicates that God has an eternal purpose, an eternal intention.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This purpose is to gain a people to be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament God called the children of Israel, and they became His people to express Him on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The children of Israel, however, were a type; they were not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reality came in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the New Testament we see a people, which is the church, the real expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we have the reality in the New Testament, we do not have there a full picture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we had only the New Testament reality, it would be difficult to understand every aspect of this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every reality is present, in type, in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we need to consider further the picture in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE EXODUS FROM EGYPT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God chose the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the picture in the Old Testament, this people fell into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the end of the book of Genesis, we are told that Joseph, the representative of the chosen people of God, was put in a coffin in Egypt Gen 50:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the first book of the Bible ends with God s chosen people being put into a coffin in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Bible had only this one book, we would have to weep for this pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But praise the Lord that Exodus follows Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word exodus means a going out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The children of Israel went out of their coffin and out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before we made our exodus, we were in a coffin in Egypt, in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was my condition fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hallelujah, we have made our exodus out of our coffin in Egypt!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt included two things: the Passover and the crossing of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Passover there were two main items the blood of the lamb and the meat of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The blood covered the children of Israel so that God s righteous judgment might pass over them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word Passover indicates that God passed over His people who were under the redeeming blood of the Passover lamb Exo 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hallelujah for the blood!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although God s people were covered by the blood, they still had to eat the meat of the lamb in order to be strengthened to escape from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They had to be strengthened to walk out of the coffin and ultimately out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On God s side, the children of Israel had been redeemed and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But, on Satan s side, the side of the evil power signified by Pharaoh and the Egyptian forces, the children of Israel were not allowed to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, there was the need for the crossing of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In contrast to the river of water of life, the water of the Red Sea does not appear to be very pleasant or positive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one would care to drink water from the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In God s economy there are two kinds of water: the water of the Red Sea, and the water of life in the flowing river proceeding from the throne Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although the water of the Red Sea does not quench our thirst, it surely buries the Egyptian army, the evil forces of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By the crossing of the Red Sea, God s chosen people were delivered from Pharaoh s tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The blood of the Passover lamb did not deliver them from this; the blood that covered them delivered them from God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was the water of the Red Sea that delivered God s chosen people from Pharaoh s tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah for the Passover and for the exodus!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now, having made our exodus out of Egypt, we are on the seashore dancing and praising Exo 15:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Praise the Lord, we are real Hebrews, true river crossers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all have passed through the waters of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our baptism was our crossing of the Red Sea 1 Cor 10:1-2 .</S>
