   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Poor Christianity!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They do not care if you are withered or alive as long as you keep the regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you keep the "sabbath" with a withered hand, they do not care.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But where is the rest?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no rest for a withered member.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus said in effect, "I do not care for the sabbath; I just care for My members, My fallen sheep."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The religious people say, "Look, we are so sound, we are so scriptural, we have everything in order."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Lord Jesus would say, "I'll have none of it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I only care to heal my members and rescue my sheep."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus did not care for all the regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does it mean to keep the sabbath?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But to heal a withered hand really means something.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To lift the fallen sheep out of the pit really means something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If so many hundreds of people were made alive by being buried, what can you say?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some say our meetings are too noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They cannot bear our shouting and praising.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But look at the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, if you go to the so-called Christian churches in America on Sunday morning, it is rather difficult to find many under the age of thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are mostly all old people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But most of us here are under the age of thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have so many young people who have sold themselves for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They care for nothing but Christ as the Head and the Church with all the members as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If so, what would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Oh, bury the old dead religion!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have been in it for years as a withered member.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord does not care if people are noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A number of times in the Psalms, it says, Make a joyful noise unto God 66:1; 81:1; 95:1, 2; 98:4, 6; 100:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is a God of the living, not of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Living ones must be noisy; only the dead ones are quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no need to command the dead to be quiet; they are quiet because they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today is not the age of formalities; today is not the age of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today is the age of the living Christ and the living members; not the Christ in teachings and doctrines, but the Christ in life, the Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Look at all these young people who are sold out for Christ and the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They will burn the whole country for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord cares for Himself as the Head, and He also cares for all His members.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will cure the withered members, He will rescue the fallen sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He will make a living church, not a formal church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah, the hungry disciples were fed, and the man with the withered hand found rest, the sheep fallen into the pit was rescued.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means negatively that He will take away all the regulations, and positively that He will give us food, healing, rescue, and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is the only way for us to find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rest is not in anything religious; religion burdens us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His yoke is gentle, and His burden is light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because it is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anything of life is so gentle and easy to bear.</S>
