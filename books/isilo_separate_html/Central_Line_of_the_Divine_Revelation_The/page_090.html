The Way in the Gospel of John</H2><P>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit&#151;the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God&#151;comprises at least twenty-five items in the Gospel of John. In this message we will cover the first thirteen items.</P><P>Most Christians are very familiar with the Gospel of John. After I was saved, I spent time in the Gospel of John and discovered that there were many things in it that were difficult to understand. I had many questions which could not be answered even by the Christian workers, such as, What is the Word (1:1)? What is regeneration (3:6)? and What is eternal life (3:16)? The Gospel of John may be very familiar to us, but we should not consider that it is a shallow or superficial book. It is a book that is full of depth. Therefore, we need to "dive" into these depths and "mine" the treasures in the depths of this book.</P><P>The apostle John used very simple words and language in his Gospel. This is a strong characteristic of his writings. The language he used is simple, but the matters conveyed by his words are very profound. Because many things in the Gospel of John are quite deep, few have spent the time to dig out the things in this Gospel. Thank the Lord that through the years, by reading their books, we have received help from others. The Bible has been read again and again throughout the past twenty centuries by millions of Christians. We are standing on the shoulders of all the foregoing saints. I am grateful to the Lord that the top understanding of those in the past was preserved in their books. Today, because of their writings we are able to know what the brothers in earlier years understood.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_089.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_091.html">Next</a> </body></html>
