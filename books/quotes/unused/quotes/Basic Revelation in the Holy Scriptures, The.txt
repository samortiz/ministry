The last four points are the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the ultimate consummation the New Jerusalem
Romans begins with our condition as sinners, fallen mankind, but Ephesians opens by bringing us into God's heart
In Romans 1 we can see our condition as sinners, but in Ephesians 1 we can see that there is something in the heart of God
The King James Version translates this word 'the adoption of children,' but the word in the original language means sonship
God's heart's desire, then, is to have a vast multitude of sons who express Him, not only in this age but for eternity
In Ephesians 3:11 Paul tells us again that God made a plan in Christ, a plan of the ages, an eternal plan, an eternal purpose
The same Greek word, oikonomia, is found in 1:10 and 3:9, where it seems better to translate it as dispensation
In Ephesians 3:8 he says that God appointed him to preach, to minister, to distribute, or to dispense the unsearchable riches of Christ
In the New Testament there is the dispensation of grace in this age and the dispensation of the kingdom in the coming age
These He would make His sons by imparting Himself into them that they might have the divine life by being born again
In Paul's fourteen Epistles we can see that God had a good pleasure, according to which He made a plan, a purpose
The word steward is used in 1 Peter 4:10, which says that we all need to be good stewards, dispensing the varied grace of God
Following this, He arranged a universal administration of His household to dispense His riches into His chosen people
Darby's New Translation of the Bible translates this word 'predestinated' in Ephesians 1:5 as 'marked out beforehand'
The word Elohim is plural and in Gods own conversation He uses the pronouns us and our Let us make man in our image after our likeness
God created man with the intention that one day He would enter into man and that man would be able to receive Him
The Hebrew word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is translated 'spirit' in Proverbs 20:27, which says, 'The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah'
Genesis 1 tells us that God created man in His own image, after His likeness; this was so that he could contain God
God created us not only with a mouth and a stomach to receive physical food; He also created us with a spirit to receive Him
The Lord Jesus said in John 4:24, 'God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality'
At the beginning of the Bible God prepared a man in His image, after His likeness, and with a spirit to receive, contain, and express Him
We opened our inner being to repent, to believe, and to receive the Lord Jesus; He came into us, and we were saved
There is nothing wrong with this, but in order to experience Christ as our life after being saved, we must know that He is now in our spirit
God's purpose is for sonship, and sonship is accomplished by the dispensing of what God is into us as our life
Even if we could go back into our mother's womb and be born physically a hundred times, we would still be flesh
Zechariah 12:1 tells us that there are three crucial things in God's creation: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man
Revelation 13:8 says that the Lamb, that is, the Redeemer, Christ, was slain 'from the foundation of the world'
From the time creation came into existence, in the eyes of God, Christ, as the Lamb ordained by God, was slain
In God's view He was slain from the day creation came into existence because God foreknew that His creation would fall
These verses show that Gods redemption was not an afterthought but rather something ordained planned and prepared by God in eternity past
Likeness denotes strongly that Christ's humanity does not have sin, but still that His humanity was in some way related to sin
The Lord Jesus said to him in a rebuking tone, 'You are the teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things'?
John 1:29 refers to the Lamb of God, and John 3:14 refers to the Son of Man, Christ, lifted up like the brass serpent in the wilderness
By His incarnation for the accomplishment of redemption, He, as the very God, took this step of making Himself one with man
Hebrews 2:14 tells us, 'Since therefore the children have partaken of blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner shared in the same'
The Son Himself tells us clearly that He came in the Father's name and that the Father was with Him all the time
Gods plan is mainly the work of the Father His redemption is mainly the work of the Son and His application is mainly the work of the Spirit
We do not believe in modalism a heresy which says that when the Son came the Father was over and then when the Spirit came the Son was over
We believe that God is three-one, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as one God coexisting and coinhering from eternity through eternity
We have no human words to explain the incarnation in full; neither can we fully explain the fact of Christ's death
According to Isaiah 53:6, when Christ was on the cross God took all our sins and put them upon this Lamb of God
Romans 8:3 says that God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin , condemned sin in the flesh
When Christ was crucified, not only were our sins dealt with and not only was our sin dealt with; we ourselves were crucified
In Ephesians 2:15 Paul tells us that through His death on the cross, Christ abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances
The Jews even used the term 'uncircumcision' in referring to the Gentiles, while they considered themselves the circumcision
These ordinances had been a strong and high wall of separation between Jews and Gentiles, but now it was torn down
The ordinances have been abolished, but what about the differences between the races, such as the difference between blacks and whites?
In the new man there is no Greek and no Jew, no social rank, no racial distinctions, no national differences; Christ is all and in all
From John 12:31 we know that when Christ was crucified, He cast out Satan, the ruler of the world, and He judged the world
All the ordinances the habits, customs, traditions, and practices among the human race were abolished on the cross
His death not only terminates all negative things; it also releases the divine life the unique positive thing in the whole universe
When His humanity was broken on the cross, the divine life came out from within Him, and He was glorified in that life
Incarnation was His birth as a man, but resurrection was His birth in His humanity as the firstborn Son of God
Before His resurrection He was the only begotten Son ; then in resurrection He was born of God as the firstborn Son
In resurrection He was born as the firstborn Son of God, and in His resurrection we also were born as the many sons of God
In resurrection, the subject of 1 Corinthians 15, Christ as the last Adam, through His death and resurrection, became a life-giving Spirit
He was made Lord and Christ , and He was given to be the Head over all things to the church, which is His Body
In His resurrection He breathed the Holy Spirit into His disciples; then in His ascension He poured out His Spirit upon His believers
In His resurrection Christ became the Firstborn, making us all His brothers, and He also became the life-giving Spirit breathed into us
In His ascension Christ was made the Head over all things, He was made Lord and Christ, and He poured Himself out as the Spirit upon us all
We have covered the first two items of the basic revelation in the Holy Scriptures God's plan and Christ's redemption
The Father planned, the Son accomplished, and the Spirit comes to apply what Christ accomplished according to the Father's plan
The main titles used for the Spirit of God in the Old Testament are the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah
Andrew Murray in his masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, points out that the divine title, the Holy Spirit, is not used in the Old Testament
The King James Version says, 'the Spirit was not yet given,' but the word 'given' is inserted; it is not in the Greek text
If the lamb is a type of Christ and if the olive oil is a type of the Holy Spirit, surely these four spices are also types concerning Christ
By all these we can realize that this compound ointment should be an all-inclusive type of the compound Spirit referred to in John 7:39
The Spirit of God, as the basic element, has been compounded with Christ's deity, humanity, death, and resurrection as the spices
Christ is Christ, and you are you; and His death is not yours unless you are joined to Him organically by the Spirit
In the compound Spirit there are the elements of Christ's death and its effectiveness, typified by myrrh and cinnamon
If you go to a heathen country to preach the gospel, you need the Spirit of Jesus to face the opposition and persecution
In Acts 16 for persecution Paul needed the Spirit of Jesus, but in Romans 8 in resurrection there is the Spirit of Christ
The Holy Spirit of God is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of the suffering Jesus and the Spirit of the resurrected Christ
Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension are all in this one Spirit, so with this Spirit there is the bountiful supply
He magnified Christ, not by his energy or by his own strength, but by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Do not think that when the Bible says the Lord is the Spirit it annuls the distinction between the Son and the Spirit
In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus tells us that whoever loves Him, He and the Father will go to this one and make an abode with Him
Also, in John 14:17 the Lord Jesus tells us that the Spirit as the Spirit of reality will come to abide in the believers
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
A note in the Scofield Reference Bible says, 'Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is the final name of the one true God'
After His resurrection the Spirit of God was compounded, and He is now the compound, all-inclusive, processed Spirit
In Revelation 1:4-5, however, the Father as the eternal One is first, the seven Spirits are second, and the Son is third
Not only the Spirit of the Trinity is Spirit, but the entire God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is Spirit
With the Lord's ascension to the heavens and the pouring out of the Spirit, the whole operation of the Triune God was completed
The Father planned with the Son and the Spirit, and the Son came with the Father and the Spirit to accomplish what the Father had planned
Finally, the Spirit came with the Father and the Son to apply what the Father had planned and what the Son had accomplished
Whatever He planned, whatever He has accomplished, whatever He will apply to us is all wrapped up in this compound Spirit
When you exercise your spirit to pray over a verse of the Bible, that verse gets into your mouth and your heart
We are presenting the truth to help the saints know that our God is triune for us to partake of Him, enjoy Him, and experience Him
Just as we have a mouth and a stomach for our food, we have also a human spirit, which is our spiritual mouth and spiritual stomach
To wash away the stain from his shirt is another God, at our believing in the Lord Jesus, not only forgave us but also washed us
As part of our initial salvation, we have been positionally sanctified, that is, separated by God from the world unto Himself
The death of Christ has fully fulfilled and satisfied God's righteous requirements, so that we are justified by God through His death
To be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus equals to be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
It should signify that we are putting those being baptized into the Triune God, into Christ, and into His death and resurrection
We have been baptized, then, into the Triune God, into Christ, into the death and resurrection of Christ, and also into the Body, the church
Though he does not use the word mingled, he surely conveys the thought that these two spirits are considered as one
Is the consummate charge of the New Testament: to live, to have our being, to walk, to move, and to act according to the mingled spirit
To walk according to the Spirit is much higher than to walk according to ethical teachings or moral regulations
Even when we are arguing or when we are about to argue, the anointing within moves in us not to continue, but to go to our bedroom and pray
One day a sister went shopping, but whenever she picked up an item to consider buying it, the anointing within told her to put it down
Few Christians pay attention to the growth in life and the building up as the Body of Christ and as the church, the house of God
Spirituality comes out of the growth in life; the aim of the growth in life is the building up of the Body of Christ and of the house of God
Finally, we shall be glorified in the divine life and divine nature to bear the glory of God for His expression in the New Jerusalem
The way to enjoy Christ in all His doings is to walk according to the mingled spirit and to call on His dear name
In ancient times when the city called its citizens together for a gathering, that congregation was an ekklesia
Oikos means both house and also the folks, the family, that make up the household; thus, it may also be translated household
God's dwelling place today on earth is the church, and God, as such a great Father, has a family, which is the church
To us the house is one thing, and the family another; the house is the building, and the family is the people who live there
Both the house of God and the family of God are one entity, that is, a group of regenerated, called ones, indwelt by God Himself
A group of Christians may be an assembly, but may not actually be the house of God because they do not live in the spirit
They may say they are the Body of Christ, but actually they may not be, because they are still living in the natural life
The church is not only the living family of God the Father, but even more a living organism of Christ the Head
There are many who love the Lord and are devoted to Him and yet who do not realize that their natural life should be put aside
When we act as those who are Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, American, British, German, French or Italian, we are no longer the church
Grammatically 'the fullness' is in apposition to 'His Body'; this means the Body is the fullness, and the fullness is the Body
The church is not only the Body of Christ, but also the fullness, the expression, which issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ
It is the house or household of God , it is the Body of Christ , and it is the fullness as the expression of Christ and of God
While we are enjoying Him in such a way, we are being filled with all the riches of Christ, resulting in an expression of God
The church today should be such an expression, issuing out of the rich enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ
Let Him settle in every room, every avenue, and every corner of your inner being in your mind, your emotion, your will, your conscience
When Peter recognized that the Lord Jesus was the Christ and the Son of God, the Lord told him that He would build His church on this rock
In Matthew 18 the Lord Jesus said that if we have any problem that we cannot solve, we should tell it to the church
We must have a local church that we are part of, from which we can get help and to which we may go with our problems
There are churches mentioned in Acts 14:23 and 15:41; here the word churches is used because there were a number of cities in these regions
The Spirit is the expression, the Son is the shape, the form, and the Father is the substance of the church as the wonderful lampstand
To say that the church is the embodiment of the Triune God is not to make the church a part of deity, an object of worship
Since we have been born of God, we surely have God's life and possess His nature, and we enjoy this life and nature every day
Romans 8:34 tells us clearly that Christ is at the right hand of God, but verse 10 of the same chapter says 'Christ is in you'
In the same chapter, one verse tells us that Christ is in the heavens and another verse tells us that Christ is in us
The purpose of electric current is to impart electricity into the bulbs so that they might all express the light of electricity
If someone has been immersed elsewhere, they will not let him join them unless he accepts their immersion done by their pastor
To him everyone must firstly be born of his mother, signified by the water, and then he must be born of the Spirit
If possible, we can minister life to him by witnessing, telling him how we have received Christ and how we experience Him as life
The Father's plan, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's application produce the believers, who are the components of the church
The circles entitled 'The Dispensation before Law' and 'The Dispensation of Law' are colored brown, signifying something earthly
The circles entitled The Dispensation of Grace and The Dispensation of the Kingdom are colored blue signifying the kingdom of the heavens
The last circle is colored golden yellow, but it is quite different from the golden yellow circle of eternity past
In eternity future is the New Jerusalem, which is a composition of all the saints from all the preceding dispensations
Some will be from the patriarchs, some from the Israelites, some from the church, and some also from the millennium
All the saints, from these four dispensations will be gathered together as the ultimate consummation, the New Jerusalem
The overcoming believers will participate in the enjoyment of the millennial kingdom, but the defeated ones will miss the mark
In 1 Corinthians 5:1-5 the Apostle Paul deals with a brother who is involved in fornication with his father's wife
When the Lord Jesus comes back to set up the kingdom, could such a defeated believer be a king along with the Apostle Paul?
The second dotted black circle, underneath 'The Appearance of the Kingdom of the Heavens,' signifies the world, the nations
Within Christendom is the church, a composition of the genuine Christians and not including the merely nominal ones
That struggling within you is the working of the Holy Spirit to transform your mind concerning the matter of dancing
A mustard seed is an herb to produce food, but in this parable it grows into a tree, a lodge for birds, that is, for evil persons and things
Outwardly flourishing the great tree speaks of the enterprises of Christendom which are the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens
John the Baptist, the first preacher of the New Testament age, told people, 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
Whatever we do for the kingdom of God is what we do for the gospel because in God's eyes the kingdom and the gospel are synonymous
Whether or not you inherit eternal life as your blessing depends upon whether you are an overcomer or a defeated one
In Matthew 16:18-19 the Lord says that He will build His church and then that He will give to Peter the keys of the kingdom of the heavens
Romans 14:17 says, 'For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
The church life, the kingdom of God, is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit
The kingdom was sown in the Gospels by the Lord Jesus in the midst of the Jews and within the Lord's disciples
When the Lord sowed the seed of the kingdom among the Jews within His believers, the Jews could not discern it
The kingdom is Jesus Christ Himself sown into us and growing in us until one day there will be the manifestation of the kingdom
Acts 1 :3 tells us that He was with the disciples for forty days, 'speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God'
The mentioning of endurance in Revelation 1:9 indicates that the kingdom in which John was is not something yet to come
Most Christians do not realize that there is a difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens
In the chart on pages 76 through 77 are six circles, which include all the dispensations from eternity past to eternity future
The kingdom of the heavens is a part of the kingdom of God just as Texas and Louisiana are part of the United States
Texas and Louisiana are the United States, but it is not correct to say that the United States is Texas and Louisiana
We can say that the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom of God, but we cannot say that the kingdom of God is the kingdom of the heavens
The ministry of John the Baptist begins the New Testament, but he himself was not in the kingdom of the heavens
Between the close of the Old Testament age and the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens was a transitional period
When the Lord Jesus came out as the sower to sow the seed, the kingdom of the heavens had not yet come; it had only drawn near
Jesus began His ministry in the same way, telling people to repent, for the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near
At the time the Lord Jesus spoke the word in Matthew 21:43, the kingdom of God was there, but the kingdom of the heavens had only drawn near
Peter used one of these keys to open the gate for the Jewish believers to enter the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost
The reality of the kingdom of the heavens, as the reality of the church life , is revealed in Matthew 5 through 7
Pagan practices heretical doctrines and evil matters have been mixed with the teachings concerning Christ to leaven the whole of Christendom
With the pope and the cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church we can also see Christendom, the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens
The kingdom of God is a part of God's eternal salvation to all believers, the entrance into which is by regeneration
The kingdom of the heavens is Christ's dispensational reward because it is just one period of time lasting one thousand years
Panton once said that the Christian teachers of his day were giving out tickets for others to enter into the kingdom of the heavens
According to Panton, too many Christian preachers were cheating their listeners and giving them worthless tickets
Many Christians today live in a loose way because they do not realize this matter of dispensational reward and punishment
Calvin is strong in the matter of eternal predestination, with which we agree, but he did not see the dispensational reward
Without this key there is no satisfactory way to interpret much of Matthew and the five warnings in the book of Hebrews
His judgment will decide whether we will be rewarded with an entrance into the kingdom of the heavens or be punished in some way
Among the believers in the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are some faithful overcomers to whom the Lord promises a reward
The remnant of the purged nations will be the people of the nations to enjoy the restored blessing of God's creation eternally
Will also be a warning to us to be in the right place and the right track that we may arrive at the right destination
In creation God called 'not being as being' , but a city signifies something further because a city is a building
The Lord was telling them that they were the builders and that He was the cornerstone, which they as the Jewish leaders were rejecting
Christ's being the Savior is based upon His being the cornerstone which was rejected by the builders in the Old Testament economy
In His old creation He did breathe the breath of life into man , but that breath was not something of His essence or nature
That breath of life, neshamah , became the spirit of man; as Proverbs 20:27 says, 'The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord'
God came to impart not only something of Himself, but also Himself into man that man might be regenerated by Him , born of Him
The natural material out of God's creation is not qualified to be used for His building material because it has nothing of God's essence
When the oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, it secretes its life juice around the sand and makes it into a precious pearl
In Paul's concept the natural created man is wood, hay, and stubble; the regenerated, transformed men are gold, silver, and precious stones
When Peter came to the Lord Jesus, he was a 'dusty' man, a man made of dust , because he was born of the Adamic race
The entire New Testament, however, is saturated with this thought of the divine building of transformed humanity
These six items the bride, gold, pearls, precious stones, the tree of life, and the river are all found in the first two chapters of Genesis
When the children of Israel had been brought to Mount Sinai, God revealed to them the design of His tabernacle, and they built it
Many Christians, even Christian workers, are making the church no church by using the natural way, the fleshly way, man's way
To understand the last two chapters of Revelation, then, we must go back and study Exodus 25 through 40 and John 1:14
On top of the mountain is a throne, from which the street spirals down to the bottom to reach the twelve gates
The foundation and the wall built with precious stones signify the saints transformed by the sanctifying Spirit
Dust, regenerated into stone and transformed into precious stone, is qualified to be used as God's building material
The length, the breadth, and the height of the city are equal, just as the Holy of Holies in the Old Testament had three equal dimensions
The principle is that such a building of three equal dimensions signifies the Holy of Holies, which is the very place where God dwells
In the Old Testament the temple was in the city of Jerusalem, but in Revelation 21 and 22 the entire city is the tabernacle and the temple
The glory of God as the light and the Lamb as the lamp signify that God in Christ is the light of the New Jerusalem in eternity
Out of it proceeds the river of water of life in the middle of the street, with the tree of life as a vine growing along its two sides
Today in the Lord's recovery we are in this fellowship, which is along the street with the river flowing and the tree growing
In John's Gospel, at a time when the disciples of John were jealous of Jesus, John said, 'He who has the bride is the bridegroom'
As the friend of the Bridegroom, John was glad for his followers to leave him and go to Jesus, because He was the Bridegroom
At the conclusion of the sixty-six books of the Bible is Revelation 22:17, which says, 'The Spirit and the bride say
After thirty-three and a half years He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and He was slaughtered on the cross
We are the children of God, being transformed that we may be built up as a house to serve God and as the Body to express Christ
Revelation 1:1 says that God gave the revelation of Jesus Christ to Him to show to His slaves; 'and He made it known by signs'
John received a revelation concerning things so divine, so mysterious, so profound, that no human words could explain it adequately
The Lord's changing water into wine was a miracle, but John calls it a sign , indicating that it has a meaning
God's tabernacle among His people was not only where He dwelt but also where His serving ones entered to dwell with Him
Most fundamental expositors follow the Brethren teaching, that this woman signifies Israel and her man-child signifies Christ
The thousand two hundred and sixty days in 12:6 are three and a half years, which all agree is the period of the great tribulation
These indicate three categories among God's redeemed people: the Patriarchs, Israel, and the New Testament believers
Right before the great tribulation these martyred saints will be resurrected and raptured to the throne of God
She is called the great prostitute because of her sinful relationships with the rulers of the earth for her profit
At the end of this book there is an aggregate, a composite lampstand, not the local ones but the eternal one, the universal one
The lampstands are signs of the churches; the New Jerusalem is also a lampstand, the sign of God's dwelling place
With such a clear and accurate view do you believe that the New Jerusalem will be a physical city built by God throughout all the centuries
Just because this book uses the lion as a sign of Christ as the triumphant king, we should not think that Christ is like a lion in the zoo
Since we do not take the other signs literally, we may be sure the New Jerusalem is not a physical city for us to live in
If you do not interpret Christ as a lion with four legs and a tail, why would you think the New Jerusalem is an actual city?
As part of our gospel preaching, we had a song about how we would enter the pearly gates and walk on the golden street
The New Testament tells us that the church is God's house, and that God is abiding in His house; but where is the church?
Do you believe that when we enter into the new heaven and new earth we shall get out of God and God will get out of us?
We must believe that our abiding in the Lord and His abiding in us will be intensified, enlarged, and uplifted to the uttermost
Since the Triune God will be the temple and the entire city will be the Holy of Holies, the city cannot be something physical
After the New Testament age, when we get into eternity, God's dwelling will not change from living persons to a lifeless, physical city
He lived on this earth, was crucified, and then resurrected, ascended, and poured Himself out as the Spirit upon His disciples
What God cares about is a living composition of His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people
These people, built together to be God's dwelling, firstly experienced regeneration through Christ's death and resurrection
When a grain of sand wounds the oyster, it secretes a substance around the sand, which makes the sand become a pearl
The wound of the oyster signifies death, and the secretion of life juice around the grain of sand signifies the resurrection life
In the holy city God's nature or God's essence becomes our basic element, signified by gold ; the city proper is gold and the street is gold
The Lord Jesus told the Sadducees in Matthew 2230 that in the resurrection there will be no marriage but that we will all be like the angels
Paul says he has laid the foundation, but we must all be careful how we build: we must build with gold, silver, and precious stones
The New Jerusalem has been a puzzle to Bible readers and teachers throughout the twenty centuries of the Christian era
It is very significant that the New Jerusalem stands at the end of God's entire revelation and occupies the final two chapters
He prepared the heavens, the earth, and everything else for this man whom He made in His own image and after His likeness
The horse, for example, is after the horse kind, while the peach tree and the apple tree are each after their kind
When he awoke, he had an inspiration from God and said, 'This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven'
He set up the stone he had used for his pillow and poured oil on it, calling the name of that place Bethel, which means the house of God
Waking up from that dream, he said something wonderful, something which composes and directs the entire Bible the house of God
On Mount Sinai Moses saw all the designs, and the children of Israel built a tabernacle according to this pattern
In the last chapter of Exodus the tabernacle was erected, and immediately God's glory descended from the heavens and filled this tabernacle
The first impression the Bible gives concerning the tabernacle is that it is an organic thing, an organic person
The tabernacle in the two Testaments, both Old and New, is actually a living person of two natures the human nature and the divine
When they entered into the good land, God revealed to them through David that He wanted to have something solid and not portable
When it was finished, the things from the tabernacle were brought into the temple , indicating that the two were actually one
In the New Testament the Lord Jesus in John 1:14 is revealed as the tabernacle, but in John 2:19-21 He indicates that He is the temple
There is a trend today among seminary students to believe that Christians have only one nature, which will be gradually improved
The only difference is that He has the Godhead, and we do not; yet we do have the divine life and nature as He does
In the water grows the tree of life, which bears twelve kinds of fruit every month, twelve months yearly, to feed the entire city
At the same time this light shines in and through the precious stone, as a jasper stone, signifying the transformed believers
Our spirit has been regenerated, our troublesome soul is being transformed, and our poor body is awaiting transfiguration
In the New Jerusalem the Triune God is fully mingled with the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man
The number twelve, occurring so many times, means that the holy city is a mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man
It begins with God's image for His expression, and it ends with a corporate, vast, immense, splendid expression
At the end of the same book there is the aggregate of all the lampstands, the New Jerusalem, as the eternal testimony of Jesus
Later, God brought Jacob's descendants out of Egypt and over to Mount Sinai, where they stayed for a long time
Colossians 2:9 tells us that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily, in Christ with a human, physical body
The New Testament ends with the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem as the conclusion of the Bible is called the tabernacle
John said he did not see any temple in the holy city, 'for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb'
The principle revealed in the Bible is that a building with three dimensions the same indicates the Holy of Holies
The Holy of Holies in the temple according to 1 Kings 6:20, was also three equal dimensions, of twenty cubits each
In the Old Testament we see the building of the tabernacle and the temple, which was the focus of Old Testament history
Christ is referred to as the only begotten in John 1:18 and in John 3:16, where it say that God gave His only begotten Son
Romans 8:18-22 tells us that the entire fallen creation, now under the slavery of corruption eagerly expects to see us in glory
In this body of the old creation we still have the difference between brothers and sisters but in resurrection we will all be males brothers
John says that all those who receive Him, that is, believe in His name, will be given authority to be children of God
The intention of the Lord Jesus, the tabernacle, was that we be born as sons to be the components of the coming temple
It is a composition of all the dear saints redeemed by God in all the dispensations, both of the Old and of the New Testaments
Even in the big city of London, there is a 'little city' called Buckingham Palace, where the royal family lives
The category of people who are reborn, transformed, glorified, and conformed will be the components of the New Jerusalem
We will also be kings over the nations the peoples for eternity; Revelation 22:5 says we shall 'reign forever and ever'
The sheep, on His right, will inherit the thousand-year kingdom, which God prepared for them from the foundation of the world
The judgment will not be according to the law of Moses nor according to the gospel of grace, but according to the eternal gospel
In Matthew 25, according to the verdict of Christ's judgment, the Jews and the Christians will be treated quite well by the sheep
The sheep will be transferred into the millennial kingdom to be the peoples, and the overcoming saints will be kings over them
The saints throughout all the dispensations who have been redeemed will be the reborn ones, God's sons, belonging to the royal family
The restored remnant of the unbelievers will be the peoples, the nations, walking in the light of the city and ruled by the saints
