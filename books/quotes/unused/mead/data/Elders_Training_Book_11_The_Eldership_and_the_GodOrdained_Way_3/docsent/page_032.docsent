   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING NO ONE ACCORDING TO THE FLESH;</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EVERYONE IN CHRIST BEING A NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should be blind spiritually because we know no one according to the flesh; everyone who is in Christ is a new creation 2 Cor 5:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the flesh everybody is nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Christ we all are the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we should learn not to evaluate people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should just learn to minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We minister Christ to someone to build up the new creation within him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether or not he will be promising, whether or not he will be good material for an elder or co-worker, we should leave to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not trust our evaluation of others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should simply minister Christ to build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our contacting of people and in our evaluation of people, we have many "scars."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have many scars because we have done many things wrong in these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we had never done anything wrong in our contacting of people and in the evaluating of people, we would be very successful in the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have been greatly frustrated and reduced in our effectiveness in the eldership because our contact with people has not been that proper and our consideration of people has been wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we have made mistakes, and we have scars.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I hope that this fellowship will help us for the future.</S>
