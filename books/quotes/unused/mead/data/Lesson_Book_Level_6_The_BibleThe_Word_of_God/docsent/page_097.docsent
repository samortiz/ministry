PHILIPPIANS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. The writer s , the place, and the time: This book was written by Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons 1:1 from a prison in Rome 1:13; Acts 28:30 , about A.D. 64.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It may have been written after the book of Ephesians see 1:25; 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. The subject: the experience of Christ taking Christ as our living, our pattern, our goal, our power, and our secret.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>C. The background: At the time the book of Philippians was written, the Judaizers were exercising their influence over the believers in Christ 3:2-4 . According to 1:15-18, some were preaching Christ because of envy and strife and out of rivalry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Another aspect of the background of this book concerns a matter that is very positive, the participation of the Philippian believers with the apostle Paul in the furtherance of the gospel 1:5-7; 4:14-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though the Philippian believers participated with Paul in the furtherance of the gospel, there was still at least some amount of dissension among them 1:27; 2:1-4; 4:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason for this dissension lay in the fact that they were not one in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They had been regenerated in the spirit, but they had not yet been transformed in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They had no problem in the spirit, but there were at least some problems in the soul, particularly in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some among them had different concepts, and these different concepts were causing dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>D. The central thought: In 1:20 Paul says, Christ shall be magnified in my body, and in 1:21 he declares, To me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These two statements represent the basic concept of the whole book.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this book we are charged to magnify Christ and to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To magnify Christ is not only to express Him; it is to express Christ by causing Him to be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should magnify Christ by living Him in a practical way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our daily living should be a living that lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>E. The general sketch: In the four chapters of Philippians we see Christ as the One lived out and magnified, Christ as the pattern, Christ as the goal, and Christ as our inward strength.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This book on the experience of Christ covers four major points: the expression, the pattern, the goal, and the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all need to experience Christ in this fourfold way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>F. The sections: 1 introduction 1:1-2 , 2 to live and magnify Christ 1:3-30 , 3 to take Christ as the pattern and hold Him forth 2:1-30 , 4 to pursue and gain Christ 3:1-21 , 5 having Christ as the secret of sufficiency 4:1-20 , and 6 conclusion 4:21-23 .</S>
