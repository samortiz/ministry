   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From the guardrooms we go to the borders which the King James Version translates as the "space" and which some other versions translate as the "platform."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Outside each of the guardrooms is a border, a space, which is one cubit wide.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are in two groups of three signifying the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Six means man, and two means a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Remember that the passage is ten cubits wide, meaning that the Ten Commandments are wholly fulfilled by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If, however, we deduct one cubit for the border around the guardroom on each side, this leaves the passage only eight cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eight is the number of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first day of the week is also the eighth day, the day of resurrection, and signifies a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we pass through Christ, we pass through resurrection and have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, you may say that the passage is ten cubits wide, or you may also say that the passage is eight cubits wide.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After the borders come the posts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is difficult to find the posts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ezekiel 40:14 says that the posts are a total of sixty cubits and that every post has two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The post here means the columns.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Each column has two sides, and each side is of two cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the sides of the passage are fifteen sides of two cubits each.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, there are thirty cubits on both sides of the passage, altogether equaling sixty cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fifteen is composed of three times five, signifying the Triune God in resurrection bearing all the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The number two is also present, indicating a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The number thirty corresponds with the chambers of all the pavements for enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The columns, which support the roof of the structure, indicate that we must be upheld by the supporting strength of Christ in order to enter into the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The supporting strength is of the number thirty, and the enjoyment of Christ is also of the number thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that we can enjoy only as much as Christ can support.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot enjoy more than Christ supports.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The expression of Christ, as seen in the side chambers of the temple, is also thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, the expression of Christ, the enjoyment of Christ, and the supporting of Christ are signified by thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can only express what we enjoy, and we can only enjoy what Christ can support.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From the posts we go to the porch where the number eight is used.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the foregoing portion, mainly the numbers five, six, and ten are used, but with the porch the number eight is used.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that we are now in resurrection, in a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE WINDOWS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The windows are for letting in the light and the air.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a building has no windows, it has no air and no light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Covering the windows is a lattice, a screen, which keeps out all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These are not narrow windows, but latticed windows.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have strips of material over them to protect the whole building from the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet the windows are kept open for air and light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The latticed windows signify the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are altogether thirty windows, fifteen windows on one side and fifteen on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The gate is full of windows.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that Christ is full of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The life-giving Spirit brings in the air and light and keeps out all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, the Hebrew word for lattice implies the thought of being beveled, meaning that the outer side of the window is narrow, but the inner side is wider 40:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The life-giving Spirit is always toward the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Outwardly speaking, He is not wide, but inwardly speaking, He is very wide.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While Ezekiel mentions the height of the wall, he does not give the height of the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man's concept is that he should climb higher until he reaches the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That was the concept in building the tower of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But God's intention and desire is with man on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God wants to come to the earth and to spread His testimony upon the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The entire compound of the temple does not give the impression of height, but of spreading in a spacious way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even the height of the wall is only six cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God came to the earth to be a man and to spread His testimony over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These are the details relating to the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all have passed through the gate, but we never realized the details of the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even as we take in many vitamins unknowingly in the good things that we eat, so we have passed through such a rich gate and did not know the details.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The gates signify Christ as the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the Triune God He became a man who was square, upright, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It also signifies that Christ bore the responsibility and fulfilled all the requirements of the Ten Commandments to open the gates for us to get into God and into God's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, Christ, as the number two, is the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is the resurrected one who is a living witness of victory forever.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Finally, on the two sides of each column is a palm tree.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Palm trees in the Bible signify victory and something evergreen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means everlasting victory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ is the guard of God's holiness and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ is the victorious one standing, bearing, sustaining, prevailing, and everlasting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit, quickening and enlivening.</S>
