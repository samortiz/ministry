<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. PASSING THROUGH HUMAN LIVING<br>FOR THIRTY-THREE AND A HALF YEARS</H2><P>The second great accomplishment of the processed and consummated Triune God was His passing through human living for thirty-three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. By Living a Human Life to Express<br>the Divine Attributes as Human Virtues</H2><P>One day God became a man on this earth. Then this God-man lived a human life on earth to express not anything human but the divine attributes as human virtues, thus expressing God in humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By Living a Crucified Human Life</H2><P>Christ passed through human living by living a crucified human life to express the divine life. Today we are the reproduction of this prototype. We are the God-men. We need to realize that our living must be a crucified living. We should always put our human life to death. This is to crucify our human life. This is for the purpose of expressing the divine life. Our human life has to be crucified so that the divine life, which is ours also, can be expressed. In this way we are dying to live, that is, we are dying to ourselves to live to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Set Up a Model for the Many<br>Upcoming God-men</H2><P>The processed and consummated Triune God passed through human living to set up a model for the many upcoming God-men&#151;being crucified to live that God might be expressed through humanity. This is clearly unveiled in 1 Peter 2:21, which tells us that Christ in His human living left us a model, an example, for us to copy. Christ Jesus, while He was on this earth, set up a copy for spiritual xeroxing. He was the model, the copy, for xeroxing, to produce millions of copies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Crucifying the Flesh of Sin</H2><P>On the cross Christ died an all-inclusive death. The first thing He dealt with in His death was our flesh. He crucified the flesh of sin (Gal. 5:24; Rom. 8:3b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Condemning Sin</H2><P>Christ condemned sin (sin is in the flesh [Rom. 7:18] and Christ was made sin by becoming the flesh of sin in its likeness [2 Cor. 5:21a]) and took away sin (including sins) by shedding His blood (Rom. 8:3b; John 1:29; Heb. 9:26b, 28a; John 19:34b). God as righteousness is embodied in Christ; Satan as sin is embodied in the flesh. God is in Christ, and Satan is in the flesh. On the cross Christ dealt with both the flesh and sin.</P>
