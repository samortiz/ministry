THE SECOND TRUMPET&mdash;<br />THE JUDGMENT UPON THE SEA</h2><p>In verses 8 and 9 we see the second trumpet: &ldquo;And the second angel trumpeted: and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood, and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and which had life died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed.&rdquo; Here we see that the second trumpet will damage &ldquo;the third part of the sea.&rdquo; Some powerful nations are developing their navies in order to expand their ocean territory. Their aim in doing so is to commit evil against God. In the same principle as the judgment upon the earth in the first trumpet, God will judge the third part of the sea. Verse 9 especially mentions the destruction of the third part of the ships. That part of the sea which is defiled by evil against God will be damaged by God&rsquo;s judgment.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE THIRD TRUMPET&mdash;<br />THE JUDGMENT UPON THE RIVERS<br />AND UPON THE SPRINGS OF WATERS</h2><p>Verses 10 and 11 describe the third trumpet: &ldquo;And the third angel trumpeted: and a great star fell out of heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of waters. The name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the waters because they were made bitter.&rdquo; Again we see that the third part of the rivers and springs of waters will be damaged. Water is crucial to human life. The opposers of God and those who practice evil against Him still enjoy God&rsquo;s creation. Although they partake of the water of God&rsquo;s creation, they continue to oppose God. One day, God will seem to say, &ldquo;Now I shall cause wormwood to fall out of heaven into your water and it will become bitter.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s judgment here still has a limitation, for it is limited to the third part of the rivers and springs.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE FOURTH TRUMPET&mdash;<br />THE JUDGMENT ON THE HEAVENLY HOSTS</h2><p>In verse 12 we read of the fourth trumpet, the judgment on the heavenly hosts: &ldquo;And the fourth angel trumpeted: and the third part of the sun and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars were smitten, so that the third part of them might be darkened and the day should not appear for the third part of it, and the night likewise.&rdquo; After the judgment of the earth, the sea, and the rivers, God&rsquo;s judgment will smite the third part of the heavenly hosts, damaging the third part of the sun, the moon, and the stars. The part of the sun to be damaged will be that part which shines upon the evil nations. God knows this part, and it will be darkened.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_098.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_100.html">Next</a> </body></html>
