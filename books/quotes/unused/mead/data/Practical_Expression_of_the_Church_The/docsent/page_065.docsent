   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH Scripture reading: John 15:4-5, 7-8; Philippians 1:27; Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; 8:1 THE CHURCHES' INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we must see the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The increase of the church is to impart Christ to others and make them a part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The branches of the Vine bear fruit by imparting the life of the Vine to others and making them a part of the Vine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the branches of a vine do not bear fruit, there will be no increase of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fruit-bearing of the branches is the increase of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So the increase of the church is by the fruit-bearing of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the members must bear fruit; otherwise, there will be no increase of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today in Christianity, nearly everything is abnormal, even the preaching of the Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christianity today depends upon the giant preachers with huge Gospel campaigns, but this is not so in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible, especially in the Gospel of John, the real Gospel preaching is the fruit-bearing of every member.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here in Los Angeles, the church does not have any kind of Gospel campaign, yet every month there are a good number of new converts that come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems that apparently there is no preaching of the Gospel, yet new ones are continually brought in. It is just like the Tree of Life in the New Jerusalem: it bears new fruits every month.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the proper preaching of the Gospel, and this is the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It does not depend upon great preachers and large Gospel campaigns.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The normal daily life of the members of the church is simply to bear fruit; then there is the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The proper way to preach the Gospel is to impart Christ into others as life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not trust in the great preachers; we have to trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every member of the church is a branch to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Consider the fruit tree.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every kind of fruit tree bears fruit at least once a year this is a natural law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do believe that as living members of the local church, we must bring at least one new convert a year to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose a branch of the vine does not bear fruit year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What do they do with it?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They prune it or cut it off.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every local church must encourage every member to bring at least one new convert to the Lord every year.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even to bring in ten or twelve a year is not too many, for that is simply like a cluster of grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the local church, we should be fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we come to the church meeting, we must come with some new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not come to the meetings alone that is not a glory; that is a shame!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to come to the meetings with others for the increase of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some of the young brothers here in Los Angeles are of Japanese origin and were recently saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were not saved by Gospel-preaching meetings, but through the daily contact of members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the proper bearing of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE WRONG CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Gospel preaching, there are some wrong concepts that I must point out to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In some of the denominational churches there is much activity in the outreach of the Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is good, but the problem is that there is too much human effort and struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is wrong, but this does not mean that we should retire from fruit-bearing and not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not be old in bearing fruit; we should always be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no retirement in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another kind of concept in Christianity is that we must wait and pray for a great revival then the Lord will send a giant speaker, and we will come together to have a Gospel campaign.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the last chapter I mentioned that we should not trust much in the teachers and ministers for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This does not work well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now I say that we must not depend much on a large campaign for the Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This also is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is a third concept at the other extreme which is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some say, "Look at those people!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All their Gospel campaigns are just in the energy of the flesh!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, we must realize that all our Gospel preaching must be the overflow of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But those who criticize in this way have been criticizing others for years, yet they themselves have not brought in any new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It seems that there is no overflow of life with them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So they have gone to the other extreme.</S>
