   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In eternity we shall also enjoy the throne of God and the Lamb 22:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is difficult to determine whether the throne of God in Revelation 21 and 22 is the throne of authority or the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Hebrews 4 the throne is the throne of grace, but in Revelation 4 the throne is mainly the throne of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the end of the Bible, the throne is both the throne of authority and the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know this by the picture in chapter twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here the throne of God and the Lamb is certainly for God s divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, it is the throne of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, proceeding out of the throne is not authority, but the river of water of life, with the tree of life as the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not authority; it is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should never separate authority from grace or grace from authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Grace and authority are one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have grace, we are under authority, and if we are under authority, we are surely partaking of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although it is true that, as Christians, we need to reign, we should not reign by authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, we should reign through the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The elders should not exercise their eldership by means of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The eldership, that is, the representation of the headship, must be exercised through the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the throne is the throne of authority, the throne of headship, out of the throne flows the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you look at the throne, you see authority and headship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when you look at the river, you see the water of life and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that proper eldership is not the exercise of authority over others; it is the flowing of life into them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are reigning, but we do not reign by authority; we reign through the flowing of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the Lord Jesus does not reign merely with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is reigning in the church, among the churches, and over all the churches through the flowing of His life as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we partake of His life, the more authority we have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The ones whom you respect in the church life are those who are mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, no one who assumes authority will be respected.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Deep in the spirits of the saints there is no respect for that kind of eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Life is the very expression of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead of assuming authority, we need to live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The very Christ whom we live out will be our authority over others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We shall enjoy this kind of authority for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The throne, the source of the life supply with the divine authority, will be our eternal enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>V. NO MORE CURSE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In eternity there shall no longer be any curse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead of the curse, the throne of God and the Lamb will be our eternal portion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The curse came in through Adam s fall Gen 3:17 and was dealt with by Christ s redemption Gal 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more fall, there will no longer be any curse.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not many Christians understand all that the curse includes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Things such as hatred, criticism, and gossip are included in the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If anyone in the church in Anaheim still gossips, this means that the church is still under a small, subtle curse.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the brothers and sisters criticize one another, that also is a sign that the church is under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, if some saints are weak to the extent that they are deadened, that is a mark of the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For there to be no more curse means that there is no longer any gossip, hatred, criticism, weakness, or deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When there is no curse, everything is smooth, pleasant, strong, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I do not like to be present in any home where a husband is exchanging words with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever I overhear such an argument, I flee because I do not want to share in the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not want to see the curse, touch the curse, or be under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I witnessed such an argument, it would be difficult to forget the impression it made on me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Each time I saw that brother and sister I would be reminded of their quarrel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A number of times, as I was approaching the home of a brother and sister, I overheard an argument between them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Immediately, I turned away and did not come back until everything had become silent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then I knocked on the door and was greeted with a pleasant, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I certainly enjoy being with a husband and wife who are praising the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I would like the impression made by their praises to linger with me forever.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Have you ever realized how much the curse includes?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Have you ever thought that no more curse includes no more exchange of words?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When there is no curse, everything is smooth, pleasant, living, bright, pure, and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we are in New Jerusalem, we shall participate in this great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, we all long to be able to say that in the church life today there is no longer any curse.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May this be the situation in all the local churches.</S>
