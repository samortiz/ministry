   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Becoming the Life-giving Spirit through His Resurrection from the Dead for the Fulfillment of the Organic Aspect of God's Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the very moment that the Lord Jesus died on the cross, blood flowed forth, and with the blood, water also flowed forth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now both are flowing on.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Blood is for the judicial aspect of God's salvation, whereas water is for the organic aspect of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Holy Spirit moved us, we repented, confessed our sins, and received forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This forgiveness is based on the judicial aspect, signified by the redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we still need the organic aspect of God's salvation, signified by the water which flowed forth with the blood, that we may attain the eternal purpose of God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Blood is for redemption; water is for life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through His resurrection from the dead the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, and as such He dispenses His life into the redeemed ones for the fulfillment of the organic aspect of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the third stage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hymn #450 in the Chinese hymnal says, "Spirit begets spirit, and spirit worships Spirit/Thus I am filled with the Spirit;/The Spirit becomes the word with abundant life/ Flowing forth rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Spirit begets spirit" means that God is Spirit and we have to be born of Him in our spirit that we may be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, since God is Spirit, we must worship Him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way we will be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, the Spirit becomes the word with abundant life flowing forth rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the conclusion of the entire Bible a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's salvation in its judicial aspect required only thirty-three and a half years for its accomplishment, but the organic aspect is endless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The judicial aspect is very simple, consisting of only five items: forgiveness of sins, washing away of sins, justification, reconciliation to God, and positional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the organic aspect comprises eight items regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification which need to be defined with twenty-two Epistles from Romans to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus needs eternity to accomplish His organic work, and the apostles needed twenty-two books to define it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the preceding messages we saw God's organic salvation in regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, and renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this message we will go on to see transformation and building up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Transformation Being the Metabolic Function of the Life of God in the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Transformation is not an outward change or correction but the metabolic function of the life of God in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Transformation is not to make some corrections from without; it is the function of metabolism from within and is manifested without.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is expressed in a line of the new hymn for this conference: "Manifesting the metabolism in life."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose a person is undernourished and appears thin and sickly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He cannot improve by merely applying some powder to his face.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, he needs to be supplemented with nutrition; then his physical condition will improve and his facial color will spontaneously become rosy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Luke 15 tells us that when the prodigal son returned home, he had a robe put on him for his covering, yet he still appeared thin and sickly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Merely to have the robe was not sufficient; he still needed to eat the fattened calf for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When metabolism began to work in him, he would naturally become strong and his facial color would look pretty.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the beauty that comes by applying powder is not genuine beauty; only that which is expressed outwardly through the inward metabolism is genuine health and real beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the believers are willing to grow in the divine life, the element of the divine life will increase in them and bring forth a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, their inward disposition will be transformed, and their outward image will also be transformed to be the same as the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not moral cultivation by examining oneself and mending one's ways as taught by Confucianism in China.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That is man's own moral cultivation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we are transformed into the image of the Lord by beholding Him, this is not the result of our self-cultivation, but it is the Lord Spirit, the life-giving Spirit whom the Lord Christ became in His resurrection, who moves within us to bring forth a metabolic change through the increase of the element of the divine life in us 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is altogether a transformation brought forth by the moving and working of the Lord Spirit and the divine life within us.</S>
