   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THE LIFE, THE REALITY, AND THE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is the focus of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 14:6 Jesus said, "I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>CHRIST OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To experience Christ as the way and as the reality, we must first experience Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If I were to ask you how Christ can be our life, you would perhaps be at a loss for words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I doubt that many Christians know the answer, but this is one of the truths that God has recovered and that He wants us to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For Christ to be our life we need to know some aspects of who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Word and the Lamb of God</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 1 Christ is portrayed as the Word who was in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This Word, who was God Himself, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ, then, is God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why did He become a man?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 29 says, "Behold the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For Christ to be our life, He first had to solve the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sin was separating us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This Man as the Lamb of God was our Redeemer whose blood was shed on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This truth of redemption is the common belief of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Grain of Wheat</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unlike redemption, the significance of this picture of Christ as a grain of wheat is not understood by most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The grain of wheat does not pertain to redemption, since a seed does not have blood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A seed contains life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The grain of wheat is for the imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While the shedding of blood was for redemption, the imparting of life is for reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is the result of the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seed sprouts and grows to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ was the single grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then He sprouted in resurrection and became many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are those many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What has become of the original grain?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only is it within us, but it has also become all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Dear ones, do you realize how precious is this truth of Christ as the grain of wheat?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I was saved, I repented of my sins, confessed to the Lord, and was cleansed by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After I had been saved for a time, I began to wonder what more there was to the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Was Christ only the Lamb to take away my sins?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The only answer I was given was that now that I was saved, I should try to lead a good Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How far short of God's intention such instruction falls!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lamb for redemption is the grain for reproducing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By death and resurrection this grain has borne much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Another Comforter</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to see further who Christ is in order for us to experience Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In chapter fourteen John records these words of Christ: "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ Himself is the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The other Comforter to be sent is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This other Comforter is not distinct from Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is simply the reality of Christ, translating Christ from an empty term to a living Person for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without "another Comforter" Christ would not be real to us.</S>
