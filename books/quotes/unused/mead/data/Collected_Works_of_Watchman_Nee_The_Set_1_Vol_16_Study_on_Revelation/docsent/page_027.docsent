   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 7:15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Because of this they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits upon the throne will tabernacle over them."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Because."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the foregoing text, the reason that they can serve God is because they did not take the matter of sin lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 7:16-17</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"They will not hunger any more, neither will they thirst any more, neither will the sun beat upon them, nor any heat; for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and guide them to springs of waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Compare this with Isaiah 49:10 cf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isa 49:6; Acts 13:47; Isa 49:8; 2 Cor 6:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"They will not hunger any more, neither will they thirst any more" is the fulfillment of hope.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Neither will the sun beat upon them, nor any heat."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the new city, there is no need of the light of the sun or moon Rev 21:23; 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not that there is no sun or moon, but there is no need to use their light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet there is still night on the new earth 21:25 ; since there is "day," there must be night.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"God will wipe away every tear" because there is no need to shed tears anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One thing deserves our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The people in Revelation 7:9-17 and the man-child in Revelation 12:1-11 have many similarities:</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1 Revelation 7:10 says that they were redeemed by the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation 12:11 says that the man-child overcame because of the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2 Revelation 7:9 says that they are standing before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Revelation 12:5 says that the man-child is caught up to God and to His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3 Revelation 7:10 says, "Salvation to our God...and to the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Revelation 12:10 says, "Salvation...of our God and...Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>4 Revelation 7:4 through 8 says that twelve tribes were sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Revelation 12:1 says that on the woman's head was a crown of twelve stars.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The crown of twelve stars does not refer to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Joseph's dream of the twelve stars clearly indicates that they refer to the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>5 Revelation 7:11 says that the angels are praising.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 12:10 says that a loud voice in heaven speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>6 The people in Revelation 7:9 must have resurrected bodies before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The man-child in Revelation 12:5 also has a resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The words "caught up" must be interpreted according to the rule of interpreting visions and must not be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to Acts 13:33-34, we see that it refers to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, if Christ did not put on the resurrected body, He could not see God and would be reckoned as naked 2 Cor 5:2-3; Exo 20:26; 28:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Corinthians 15 speaks of the fact of resurrection, while 2 Corinthians 5 speaks of the condition of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the present time, there is no Christian before the throne; this will happen only in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Revelation 4:6 the glassy sea is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not until Revelation 15:2 are there people on the glassy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Acts 2:34 clearly says that David did not ascend into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>First Samuel 28:13 clearly says that Samuel came up out of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows that they have not yet put on resurrected bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their bodies are still in Paradise in Paradise as in Luke 23:43 and in Hades as in Acts 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only the Lord descended out of heaven and still remained in heaven John 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even the taking up of Enoch and Elijah was perhaps to a certain place that God has put them; they have not yet received a resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>7 Revelation 7:15 says, "He who sits upon the throne will tabernacle over them," while Revelation 12:12 says, "O heavens and those who dwell in them."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"Dwell in them" in the original Greek is "tabernacle in them."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>8 The ones in Revelation 7:9 are the overcomers because: a the "white robes" are promised to those in Sardis who have not contaminated their robes; b to be spared from the hour of trial is promised to the overcomers in Philadelphia who have kept the word of endurance; and c the palm branches signify victory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same way, the man-child in Revelation 12:5 is the overcomers, who rule over the nations with an iron rod.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the end of the inserted visions.</S>
