<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE LAW</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 20, 1935, morning<br />Place: Chuenchow</h1><p>As believers, we live by the Holy Spirit, not by the law. Many people do not know what the law is. As a result, they do not know the Holy Spirit either. They do not know what it means to live by the law and what it means to live by the Spirit. The failure in our work is due to the fact that we work by the law and not by the Spirit. If we trust in the law, we will not have the power or the fruit because the law is something that the Lord has judged.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT IS THE LAW?</h2><p>The law is not just the Ten Commandments or the few hundred ordinances of the Old Testament. These are the Old Testament laws, but there are also New Testament laws. The Israelites in the Old Testament had their laws, and the church in the New Testament also has its laws. What is the principle of the law? When God has a will, and this will is written down on tablets of stone or on paper, including anything from one item to a thousand items of ordinances, we have the law. By walking according to these hundreds and thousands of items of the law, a man becomes clear what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is evil. He also becomes clear concerning the way he should take. This is the law. It is lifeless. Once a man begins to walk according to this dead law, he can put God aside and ignore Him. This is like saying that a student can ignore the principal of his school as long as he abides by the school rules. This is the law. Good and evil, right and wrong, are known through the written code. The path that one has to follow comes entirely from his knowledge and not from the inner leading of God. When this happens we have the law.</p><p>Many people can tell the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, without ever fellowshipping with God. This knowledge, however, is useless. Those who live this way are still living under the law. If you measure everything according to this rule, you will find that many things are still under the law. Man is naturally inclined to the law because he can easily tell from the law what is right and what is wrong. Most people are afraid of living by the Spirit. They would rather live according to some prescribed rules. Keeping the law is both legal and dead, but it is also something convenient. One can know how many laws he has kept and which ones he has come short of. The law turns man away from God. With the law, man does not need to contact God; he can put Him aside. After you have passed the gate of victory, you should no longer live under the law, but live by the Spirit (Rom. 7:6).</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING UNDER THE LAW</h2><p>Let us consider the meaning of walking according to the law. I did not know what it meant to live according to the law until a few years ago, that is, until 1928. I had been a preacher for many years, but I did not know what it meant to keep the law. It is true that I could explain the law to others according to my theological knowledge. But in my practical experience I never understood this matter. There was a time when I was gravely ill. The Lord healed me. After I was healed, I rested and recuperated by the seaside. There I met Brother Simon Meek and stayed with him for a while. His health was not good either, and he wanted me to give him some advice. I asked, "What do you want me to help you with?" He answered, "Please tell me if it is scriptural to ask for healing." I said, "God does heal people. But Timothy had to use some wine, and Epaphroditus was not healed. Paul's eyes were not good and could not read small handwriting." I went on to tell him the experience of many people who were healed. Brother Simon Meek said, "Your answer is no answer at all." At that time, I realized what the law is. If the Bible tells us what to do step by step, all we have to do is to act accordingly in a simple way. This is keeping the law. However, God wants direct fellowship with us. He wants us to receive His revelation and then act according to His revelation. If we do not fellowship with Him, the Spirit will have no outlet for His work.</p><p>Man likes to have clear instructions from the Bible concerning everything he does. For example, in the matter of divine healing, he wants a clear yes or no from the Bible. However the Bible shows us that some sicknesses were healed and some sicknesses were not healed. The Bible does not have any rule regarding this matter. God has no intention for the church to hold on to some dead letters and forsake Him. He wants to see men seeking, praying, and waiting quietly on Him. He does not want us to have any trust in something apart from Him.</p><p>The law speaks of God's past will; it is not God's present will. However, man always wants to know God's present will according to His past will. God wants man to fellowship with Him and understand His present desire through the Holy Spirit. He does not want us to merely keep the law. This is why we need to have fresh fellowship with God every day. Only then we can know His will.</p><p>The second aspect of the law is that it dictates how we should live. God does not want to decide how the church should live from day to day. He wants the church to fellowship with Him moment by moment so that the church can know His desire. If I prescribe everything that one of my employees should do and the way he should live, he can abide by my prescriptions for a day, a week, or even a month without fellowshipping with me or asking me anything. This is the principle of the law. The law is doing God's will without communicating with Him.</p><p>When I was in Shanghai, I had a servant who also was a brother. One day I considered how the Lord wants us to exercise our spirit and not follow the law when working for Him. I wanted to see if it would work if I were to deal with my servant by the Spirit and not by the law. It is convenient to lay down laws in our daily life. If I laid down some laws, it would be easy for my servant to work for me. Of course I have to abide by the same laws as well. I began to talk with my servant and told him that he should check with me in everything and not make any proposals of his own. Neither would I give him any prescribed rules. While I was talking with a friend, the servant came in a few times and asked each time, "What do you want to eat? What do you want to drink?" I said, "Just wait a while." Later, the servant confessed that it was easier to work according to some laws than to ask for instructions in everything. From this we see that it is easy to keep the law, but it is not easy to work according to the leading of the Spirit. Easy or hard, however, this is God's desire, and we cannot take the easy way. We have to take the God-ordained way, which is not being under the law but under the Spirit.</p>
