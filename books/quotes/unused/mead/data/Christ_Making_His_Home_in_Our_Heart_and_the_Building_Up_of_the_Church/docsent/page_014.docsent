   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO BECOMINGS OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 16 and 17 the Lord, the Father, and the Holy Spirit are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are these three Gods?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 28:19 says, Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are plural in number, yet the word name is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is the one unique God, yet He is the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is something that the human mind cannot explain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this reason, some theologians have attempted repeatedly to use analogies to explain this three-one reality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One of the analogies that is often used is vapor, water, and ice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apparently, these are three substances, but they are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is one substance in three forms.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When vapor cools down, it becomes water, and when water cools down further, it becomes ice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ice is water, and water is vapor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The theologians who use this analogy say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are just like ice, water, and vapor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, this analogy is not only incomplete; it also has the danger of deviating from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In an ordinary situation ice, water, and vapor cannot exist simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the revelation of the Bible, the Father continued to exist when He was incarnated in the Son, that is, when the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the Son continued to exist when He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit exist simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, human analogies cannot give a correct and complete explanation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the beginning God was in heaven, dwelling in unapproachable light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was dwelling in light that man can neither comprehend nor approach 1 Tim 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is the Father as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day God was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Word which was in the beginning became flesh John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the first becoming of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, declared the God whom no one has ever seen v. 18 . Hence, the Son is the manifested God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one has ever seen God, but the Son manifested Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Father is the hidden God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The God who hides Himself in a place that no one can see is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Son is the manifested God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The God who manifests Himself is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, when the Bible speaks of the Father, it refers to God as the source.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Bible speaks of the Son, it refers to God manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the Son, God could only be manifested among men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He could not enter into men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, God needed to go through another becoming.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, the Word became flesh; the hidden Father became manifested in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then the Son became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are the two becomings of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>GOD IN MAN AND MAN IN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the source, God is the Father, whom man cannot approach.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, He came in the Son to be among men and was seen by men.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time, the Lord was with the disciples on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One day the disciples asked the Lord to show them the Father, and the Lord answered, He who has seen Me has seen the Father John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, knowing the Lord is equivalent to knowing the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord came to manifest the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord is the manifested God; hence, he who has seen the Lord has seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, there was still one more thing that needed to be accomplished the Lord needed to enter into His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the Lord did not enter into His disciples, the mystery in the universe would not have been accomplished; that is, God would not have been mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order for the Lord to enter into His disciples, He had to go through another becoming.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, the Lord said that He would ask the Father to give us the Comforter, the Holy Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>16-17, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Holy Spirit is the Son, and the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Father came in the Son to be among men, and the Son became the Spirit to enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because the Son lives, we who believe in Him also live v. 19 . When we live because of the Son, we know that He is in the Father and that we are in Him, and He is in us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>My desire is that we would see God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today not only do educated people, such as scientists, politicians, and philosophers, not know God s salvation, but even many theologians and pastors do not have a complete understanding of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God s salvation is the mingling of God and man; it is God in man and man in God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Bible is a story of the Triune God working Himself into man and working man into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Just as our clothes, eyeglasses, and pens are not our person, matters such as forgiveness of sins, justification, sanctification, and escape from eternal perdition are not the focus of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Forgiveness of sins and sanctification are not the substance of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The substance of God s salvation is the Triune God being mingled with man and man being mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Are you joyful to have the Triune God dwelling in you?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You might rejoice because you have a gold watch.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, now that the Triune God, who is the Lord, is in you, are you rejoicing?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do you treasure this?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Nothing can be more glorious and precious than having the Lord in us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is a pity that many people do not realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we tell a child that there is water in the air or that there is vapor in the air, he may not understand or believe us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, we know that vapor is in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Vapor is water, and though we may not be able to touch it or feel it, it is in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Similarly, it is a fact that the Spirit of the Lord lives in you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is also a fact that the Spirit is the Lord and that the Lord is God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, the Spirit being in you is God being in you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Perhaps you do not feel it, but this is the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Spirit is in you, the Spirit is the Son, and the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the Triune God in you.</S>
