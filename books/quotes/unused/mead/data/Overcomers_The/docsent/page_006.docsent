   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. To Have a New Creation out of His Old Creation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God created the universe and man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is His old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, His intention is not to have an old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He intends to have a new creation 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To Impart Himself into His Old Creation</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to have a new creation, God imparts Himself into His old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The old creation does not have God within it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It does not have God's life or God's nature, but the new creation, constituted of the believers, who are born again of God, does John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the believers are a new creation Gal 6:15 , not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before we were regenerated, we were the old creation without God in us, but today we are happy because we have God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is our joy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible says that we should always rejoice 1 Thes 5:16; Phil 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Human life, however, is full of suffering and anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After passing through so much suffering, Job indicated that he wished he had not been born Job 3:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How can we not be anxious about anything?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is impossible in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can be free from anxiety only when we are living in God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses said, "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations" Psa 90:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is our eternal house for us to dwell in. He is our dwelling place, and we are His dwelling place 1 Cor 3:16; Eph 2:22 . We abide in Him and He abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This mutual abode is the new creation, and this new creation is God's intention.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To Consummate This Project in Four Ages in the Old Creation and through Four Peoples of His Old Creation</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's eternal economy is for Him to be one with man, making man His organism so that He can have a new creation out of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a simple project.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God consummates this project in four ages in the old creation and through four peoples of His old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the Bible, there are four ages in the old creation the age before law, the age of law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God worked in the first age, the age before law, through the race of Adam, from Adam to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He continued to work in the second age, the age of law, from Moses to Christ's first coming, through the earthly descendants of the race of Abraham Gen 13:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He goes on in the third age, the age of grace, which is the church age, from Christ's first coming to His second coming, through the heavenly descendants of the race of Abraham Gen 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then He will work to consummate His project to have a new creation in the fourth age, the last age, the age of the kingdom of one thousand years, through the overcomers of the races of Adam and Abraham Rev 12:5, 11; 14:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God uses these four ages to consummate His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This divine project takes God thousands of years to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From Adam to Abraham was two thousand years, from Abraham to Christ was two thousand years, and from Christ to today is almost two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, almost six thousand years have passed since the time of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, there will be the millennial kingdom, the kingdom of one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can see from this that it takes God thousands of years to accomplish the project of His economy to be one with man, making man His organism so that man can become His new creation with Himself as the life content.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today we are in the age of grace under the process of God's project to have a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Any thoughtful person desires to know what the meaning of human life is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Solomon said in Ecclesiastes that everything under the sun is vanity of vanities 1:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But thank the Lord that we are in His intention and that we know the meaning of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God chose us before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4 and called us in time to carry out His eternal economy to have a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God has a purpose, a project, and we are in the process of His project day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I hope that eventually I can be counted by Him as one of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My goal is eventually to be an overcomer.</S>
