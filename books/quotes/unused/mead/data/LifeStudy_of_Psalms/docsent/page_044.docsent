   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The psalmist may have been wrong grammatically, but the Spirit could never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit inspired David to compose it this way, leaving an opening for us to fill in the main clause.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After he says, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained," what should be said?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The main clause can be filled in. I would propose four ways.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It could read, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained, I say, What is man....?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I say is the main clause.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or it can read, "When I see Your heavens...I wonder," or "I consider."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It could also read, "When I see Your heavens...I shout."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The psalmist also could have said, "When I see Your heavens...I weep."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After David said, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained," there is the need of a "selah," a pause.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to stop here for a rest to consider what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I see the heavens, the works of God's fingers, the moon and the stars, I have to say and I have to ask and I have to find out "what is man?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have to say this; I have to ask this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have to find out what man is that God remembers him and visits him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By what way did God visit man?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The answer follows in verse 5a "You have made him somewhat lower than angels."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today we understand that this is incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How did God visit us?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He visited us by becoming incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He put on humanity and became a man to be a little lower than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the way God visited us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was also crowned with glory and honor v. 5b . Glory refers to His resurrection, implying His death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without death He could not have entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be crowned with glory is to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be crowned with honor implies the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore in one verse, verse 5, we see Christ's incarnation, His all-inclusive death implied, His resurrection for His glorification, and His ascension for Him to be honored.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God visited man by being incarnated, living on this earth, dying, rising up from the dead, and ascending to the heavens to be crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, God visited man through the long journey of His process to become the life-giving Spirit to reach us and to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ultimately, He was consummated as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The incarnated One is now the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is this One that can produce the babes and the sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The babes and sucklings are produced through regeneration in the initial stage.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then they continue to be produced in full through their sanctification, renewing, and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through transformation they are perfected in praising the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the Lord's recovery and the Lord's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God overcomes His enemy through these babes and sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The work of Christianity is to produce active ones; they endeavor to produce "giants."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our work is to produce babes and sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 6-8 say, "You have caused him to rule over the works of Your hands;/You have put all things under his feet: All sheep and oxen,/As well as the beasts of the field,/The birds of heaven and the fish of the sea,/Whatever passes through the paths of the seas."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These verses refer to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All things will be ruled over by Christ with His Body, and all things will be subjected under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This really perfects the praise, completes the praise, in this psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This short psalm reveals so much.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It speaks of the heavens, the earth, babes and sucklings, man, three categories of enemies, and the Lord's incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, coming back, and kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We Christians may praise the Lord, but our praise needs to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to praise Him for His splendor above the heavens and His excellency on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we can praise Him for His incarnation for Him to come to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we should go on to praise Him for His human living, for His death, for His resurrection, for His ascension, and for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to praise Him with all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then our praises will be perfected, completed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This praise is the strength out of the mouths of babes and sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Such perfected praise is the ultimate consummation of the Lord's work of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and coming back to rule on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we come to the Lord's table, we stop every kind of human speaking and human doing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We stop our work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are here at the table to do only one thing to praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to praise, we must stop our work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thus, at the Lord's table, we all are the real babes and sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>While we are here being stopped from all of our doings to praise the Lord, the adversaries, the enemy, and the avenger are all defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a shame to God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to remain in the condition and spirit of the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our Christian life should be like the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we go home after the Lord's table, we should continue to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have to learn not to do too much.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the other hand, we should not be lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The point is that we should stop our human doings and be those who simply praise the Lord.</S>
