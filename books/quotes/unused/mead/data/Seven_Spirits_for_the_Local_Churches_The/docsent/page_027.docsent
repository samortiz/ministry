   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOLDEN CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Look at Christ, and look at the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not say that the church is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No, the church is golden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you say that the church is poor, sooner or later you will lose the case.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If not today, then tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Someday the church will be so golden.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have already spoken of the heathen prophet Balaam, who was hired by Balak to curse the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time the people of God were really a mess, and Balak thought that because of their poor situation it was a good opportunity for the prophet Balaam to curse them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then Balaam tried to curse them, but when he opened his mouth, he said, He God has not beheld iniquity in Jacob Num 23:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Is that not strange?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God said through the mouth of Balaam that He has not seen any sin among the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Balak was troubled because he thought the people of Israel were full of sin, yet Balaam said that God did not behold any sin among them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then Balaam was brought to another point of view and was asked to curse them again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Balak thought that if he gave him more money, he would curse them this time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But Balaam opened his mouth and said, How fair are your tents, O Jacob 24:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not say that the people of God are a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A thousand years to the Lord are but one day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will make them golden someday.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not say that the church in Los Angeles is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must say that the church in Los Angeles is really golden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time the book of Revelation was written, I believe that the apostle John was greatly disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By that time nearly all the local churches were degraded and poor, and he was in exile on the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John must have been disappointed and troubled with the situation in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But he heard a great voice, and he turned and saw seven golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was nothing impure; every stand was golden.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Can you believe that all the local churches are golden?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day, sooner or later, there will be a great voice in the heavens saying that Babylon is fallen, and the Lamb s wife is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord will perform it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must be fully assured that everything will be so marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not be shortsighted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must learn to have foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need the foresight to see that the local churches will be so golden and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us praise the Lord for Christ, and let us also praise Him for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do have something to praise about, and we do have something to praise with.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more you say that the church is poor, the poorer it becomes in your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we must forget what we think and what we feel and put our trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must have the foresight in the Lord that all the local churches in all the localities are good.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must all learn to praise the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CALLING AND PRAISING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Word says, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Rom 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It also says, The same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him v. 12 . Do not think that to call is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is it then to call?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is even something more than this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose your house is on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do you pray?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you go to your neighbor s house and ask him to please do something to help you?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is what it means to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then what is it to call?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Fire!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Fire!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Fire!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Fire!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever my temper was stirred up, I used to pray, Lord, help me not to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But eventually, I mostly always lost my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But now when my temper is stirred up, I just say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! and my temper is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must learn to call.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is not a long-distance call; this is a local call, and the line is always open.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must learn to call on the Lord, not just to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must also learn to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Calling is better than praying, and praising is better than calling.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The best call is to praise, and praising is the best calling and the best breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord has turned the age.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should not be old anymore; we must give up the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I do not know what the new way is, but the principle is this: in the new way, teaching and preaching are not the main thing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Exercising the spirit is the main thing, either by praising, by praying, or by witnessing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is why the last book of the Bible is a book of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this last age we must be praising churches, and all our meetings must be praising meetings.</S>
