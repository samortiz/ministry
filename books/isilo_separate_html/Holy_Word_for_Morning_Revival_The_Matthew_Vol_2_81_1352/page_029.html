The sign for the evil and adulterous generation was the sign of Jonah. The Lord followed this sign with the sign of Solomon. By His word in verses 40 through 42 the Lord prophesied fully concerning His death, burial, and resurrection. Jonah was a type of Christ in His death and burial, and Solomon was a type of Christ in His resurrection. His death and resurrection were to be the unique sign to this age and to that generation.</p><p>Matthew 12:43-45 reveals the rejecting generation becoming worse. Here the Lord likened them to the demon possessed man out from whom a demon had gone. That person was like a vacant house which the Lord described with three words: unoccupied, swept, and decorated. When the demon realized that the person was unoccupied, it took seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all came to occupy the vacancy. This indicates that the Jews will not accept Christ, and their situation will become worse and worse. The Jews&#8217; rejection of Christ in this chapter caused Christ to forsake them fully. Thus, in verses 46 through 50 we see a dispensational turn. After that, His relationship with people was based upon something spiritual. All those who do the will of the Father are His relatives.</p><p>The heavenly King went out of the house and gave the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom beside the sea. The house signifies the house of Israel (10:6), and the sea signifies the Gentile world (Dan. 7:3, 17; Rev. 17:15). All the parables were mysteries to that stubborn Jewish generation simply because of their pride (Matt. 13:14-15).</p><p>In the first parable, that of the sower (13:3-8), Christ establishes the kingdom of the heavens by sowing Himself as the seed of life into believing people. The kingdom is not established by outward working but by inward growing. The Lord&#8217;s recovery today is the produce of the seed sown by Sister M. E. Barber and Brother Watchman Nee.</p><p>This parable makes it clear that our heart is the soil (v. 19), the earth, the very place where the seed is sown and where it grows. The first type of soil, the wayside-because of much worldly traffic-corresponds to those who are not poor in spirit and pure in heart. The second, the rocky places, corresponds to those who still have their temper, lust, sin, self, and flesh beneath the surface. Instead of depth, there are rocks. The third type of soil, the thorns, is difficult for the seed to grow in because of anxiety and the deceitfulness of riches. The fourth type of soil, the good heart, is the soil that can grow the kingdom.</p><p>The kingdom of the heavens began with the second parable (13:24-30, 36-43) and began to be established when the church was built (16:18-19) on the day of Pentecost. From that time, the tares, the false believers, were sown among the true believers, the wheat, forming the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The wheat and the tares are allowed to grow together in the world, not in the church (1 Cor. 5:2, 13). At the time of the harvest, the judgment upon the tares will be so serious because they have been confusing, frustrating, and damaging God&#8217;s economy.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
