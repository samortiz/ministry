   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our High Priest, Christ, who is great in His person, qualification, work, accomplishment, and attainment, has passed through the heavens 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After He was crucified and before He was resurrected, Christ walked through Hades, having a good sightseeing tour.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As He was passing through the air, the evil spirits, the principalities and powers, tried to grasp Him and hold Him back, but He stripped them off, making a display to the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the meaning of Colossians 2:15, which tells us that Christ stripped off the rulers and the authorities and made a display of them openly, triumphing over them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this verse we see three main points: that Christ stripped off the rulers and the authorities, that He made a display of them, and that He triumphed over them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now, having risen from Hades, having stripped off the rulers and the authorities, and having passed through the heavens, He is sitting on the throne at the right hand of God, where He is restfully enjoying a Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But He desires to see that all His members come into His Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The way to enter into His Sabbath is by experiencing Him as our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We simply need to come forward to the throne of grace on which He is sitting and receive mercy and find grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we do this, we are immediately in the Sabbath rest of the church life, waiting with Him for the better Sabbath to come in the age of the millennial kingdom.</S>
