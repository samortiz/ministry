 <h2 class="head1">THE SPEAKING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Hebrews emphasizes that today this wonderful One is the Spirit. In the Old Testament God spoke to the fathers in the prophets, but in the New Testament God speaks to us in the Son (Heb. 1:1-2). The opening words of chapter one introduce us to the Son, but from this time onward Hebrews refers to the Spirit. Hebrews 3:7-8a says, &ldquo;Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.&rdquo; This shows us again that the Son in chapter one is also the Spirit in chapter three. God speaks in the Son in chapter one, but in chapter three the Holy Spirit is speaking.</p>
<p>Chapter one indicates that in the New Testament age God speaks to us in the Son. In the original Greek there is no article before &ldquo;Son&rdquo;; therefore, we can say that in the New Testament God speaks to us in Son. Darby&rsquo;s New Translation of Hebrews 1:2 says that at the end of these days God &ldquo;has spoken to us in [<em>the Person of the</em>] Son.&rdquo; To say that God speaks in the Son means that God speaks in the Person of the Son.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God spoke through certain men, but in the New Testament God Himself came to speak in the way of incarnation. John 1:14 tells us that the Word, which was God Himself, became flesh. The incarnation of God means God becoming flesh. This is the way that God came. He came to speak in a man. This man is the Son of God, Jesus Christ. God&rsquo;s coming to speak in this man meant God came to speak in the Son, in the Person of the Son. The Person of the Son is God Himself. The main item in a man is the person or the personality. In a man there is a person, but you cannot say that in a person is a man. This means that, in Person, God is one with the Son. In the Son there is a Person. The Person of the Son is the Father. This is what it means when we say that God speaks in the Person of the Son.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:2 indicates that in the New Testament God speaks in the Person of the Son, but in the rest of the book of Hebrews, there is not one verse which tells us that the Son speaks. The introduction of the book of Hebrews is on God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son, but Hebrews 3:7 shows us that the Holy Spirit is speaking. Actually, in the rest of the book of Hebrews the Spirit is the One who is speaking. This indicates that God in the Son and the Son as the Spirit is the speaking One. Thus, the divine Trinity is the speaking One as the Spirit, who is the consummation of the divine Trinity in the book of Hebrews. The divine Trinity is God in the Son and the Son as the Spirit. In the book of Hebrews the Father is speaking in the Son as the Spirit. We can also say that the Spirit is speaking as the Son with the Father. Hebrews tells us that God speaks in the Son, but this book also indicates that the Spirit speaks. Therefore, God speaks in the Son as the Spirit, and eventually the Spirit as the Son with the Father is speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT&rsquo;S SPEAKING CONCERNING<br />
THE WAY TO ENTER INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit shows by the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies that the way of the Holy of Holies has not been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing (Heb. 9:8). The Holy Spirit tells us that when the old tabernacle still remained, the way to enter the Holy of Holies was not yet opened. Also, the Spirit, by this illustration, tells us that the way to enter into the Holy of Holies has been opened and that the old tabernacle has been removed. Today we do not have the old tabernacle but the new tabernacle&mdash; Christ. In the book of Hebrews the tabernacle is Christ and the offerings today are all Christ. Christ is realized as the Spirit, so when you have the Spirit, as a partaker of the Spirit, you have the tabernacle and all the offerings. The New Testament is a book of such a wonderful, unlimited Person replacing everything of the Old Testament. This Person does not replace God because He is God Himself, but He replaces Moses, Aaron, the tabernacle, and all the offerings, and His covenant replaces the old covenant. As the eternal Spirit He is everything and everywhere and He is not objective. This Spirit is always subjective within us. This eternal Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God has become our eternal enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PARTAKERS OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Hebrews 6:4 tells us that the believers have become partakers of the Holy Spirit. This shows us that we are the partakers of a wonderful Person. The Holy Spirit is the One as the Son, with the Father, being the consummation of the Triune God. We are the partakers of such a One. We have not only received the Holy Spirit, but we are now partakers of the Holy Spirit. As long as we have the Holy Spirit, we are His partakers. He is a priceless treasure.</p>
<p>Hebrews was written to show the Jewish believers that the believers in Christ have this wonderful One as a treasure who is much more precious than the angels, than Moses, than Aaron, and than the old covenant. This treasure is the all-inclusive Christ. In our practical experience, however, this all-inclusive Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit. Hebrews does not tell us that we are the partakers of the all-inclusive Christ, but that we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and the Spirit is the reaching to us of the Triune God. Without being the Spirit, the Father cannot reach us. Without being the Spirit, the Son, Christ, cannot reach us. The reaching of the Triune God to us is the Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God. This Spirit is much superior to the angels, much superior to Aaron, and He is the reality of the new covenant, which is much superior to the old covenant; we are the partakers of this Spirit. As long as we are the partakers of this Spirit, we partake and enjoy the processed Triune God with all His riches.</p>
