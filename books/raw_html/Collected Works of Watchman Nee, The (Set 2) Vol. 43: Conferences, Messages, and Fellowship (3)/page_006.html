<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD INTERRUPTING MAN'S SPEAKING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 12, 1937<br />Place: Canton<br />Scripture Reading: Mark 9:5-7; Matt. 17:24-27; Acts 10:14-16, 28-29, 34-35, 43-45</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD INTERRUPTING MAN'S SPEAKING</h2><p>All the verses we have read tonight are related to Peter and his speaking. Peter was particularly fond of talking. He always had something to say even though it was not always the opportune time to say it. Of the many times that Peter spoke, God interrupted him three times. First, the Father interrupted his speaking; then Christ interrupted his speaking; and finally, the Holy Spirit interrupted his speaking. God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit interrupted Peter's speaking three different times. These three instances are very unusual. First, God came in to restrict Peter when he had run out of words. Second, God restricted Peter before he had even begun to speak. Third, God restricted Peter after a lengthy speech as he was about to continue. These three instances were recorded in Mark 9, Matthew 17, and Acts 10.</p><h2 class="head2">The Father Interrupting Peter's Speaking<br />on the Mount of Transfiguration</h2><p>On the Mount of Transfiguration, the Lord Jesus changed His appearance, and Moses and Elijah suddenly appeared. When Peter saw this, he said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah" (Mark 9:5). Peter often addressed Christ as Lord (Adonai). But here he addressed the Lord as Rabbi. The Bible continues, "He did not know what to answer." On the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter saw Christ as the Rabbi, and he also saw two others in addition to Christ&mdash;Moses and Elijah. While Peter was saying, "It is good for us to be here," God would not allow him to go on. He stopped Peter's speaking: "And a voice came out of the cloud: This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him!" (v. 7). This was the Father interrupting Peter's speaking.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ Interrupting Peter's Speaking<br />in the House at Capernaum</h2><p>In Matthew 17 when the Lord was in Capernaum, the temple-tax gatherers came to ask Peter, "Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?" (v. 24). Peter said, "Yes." After Peter answered, he thought, "What if Christ does not pay the tax?" Therefore, he came into the house to tell the Lord. But the Lord had already prepared something to say to him. Verse 25 says, "Jesus anticipated him, saying..." This means that Christ would not allow him to speak. On the Mount of Transfiguration, the Father interrupted Peter's speaking. Inside the house beside the seashore, Christ interrupted Peter's speaking.</p><h2 class="head2">The Holy Spirit Interrupting Peter's Speaking<br />in the House of Cornelius</h2><p>Peter was a Jew, and Jews did not associate with Gentiles. However, God purposely chose Peter to open the door of the gospel to the Gentiles; He did not choose anyone else. One day Peter saw a vision. "He beheld heaven opened, and a certain vessel like a great sheet descending, being let down by four corners onto the earth, in which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven. And a voice came to him: Rise up, Peter; slay and eat! But Peter said, By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean. And a voice came to him again a second time: The things that God has cleansed, do not make common. And this occurred three times; and immediately the vessel was taken up into heaven. Now as Peter was utterly perplexed in himself as to what the vision which he had seen might be, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made diligent inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate. And they called out and inquired whether Simon, who is surnamed Peter, was lodging there" (Acts 10:11-18). The Holy Spirit then urged Peter to go with them.</p><p>The next day Peter went with the messengers of Cornelius. When he arrived at the house, he preached the gospel to the people with the opening words: "In truth I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons, but in every nation he who fears Him and works righteousness is acceptable to Him" (vv. 34-35). Peter evidently perceived the significance of the vision, but did not entirely agree with God. He went on and on with his speaking, but the Holy Spirit did not wait for Peter to finish. He fell upon all those who heard the word (v. 44). This was the Holy Spirit interrupting Peter's speaking. When Peter saw that the Holy Spirit was being poured out on the Gentiles, he said, "Can anyone forbid the water so that these would not be baptized?" (v. 47).</p>
