   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the economical Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His economy, the Divine Trinity is distinctly the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit of God, the Third of the Divine Trinity, has become the life-giving Spirit as the aggregate of the Divine Trinity, the consummated, compound Spirit of the processed Triune God, even the consummation of the processed God 1 Cor 15:45b; John 7:39; Matt 28:19b; Phil 1:19b; Rev 22:17 .</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A hin of olive oil, which was the base of the ointment, was compounded together with the spices of myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, is the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would experience God today as the consummated God, we have to experience the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Day by day, morning until evening, our Christian life, our Christian walk, and our Christian experience are all a matter of enjoying the consummation of the processed Triune God, who is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
