   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Cor 9:24-27; Phil 3:12-14; 2 Tim 4:7-8 The Christian life is a race, and we must run this race to receive the prize, the incorruptible crown, which the Lord will award to His overcoming saints who win the race Heb 12:1; 1 Cor 9:24-25: All the saved Christians must run the race to win the prize 1 Cor 9:24 , which is not salvation in the common sense Eph 2:8; 1 Cor 3:15 but a reward in a special sense Heb 10:35; 1 Cor 3:14 .</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must pursue toward the goal, the fullest enjoyment and gaining of Christ, for the prize, the uttermost enjoyment of Christ in the millennial kingdom as a reward to the victorious runners of the New Testament race Phil 3:12-14: In order to gain Christ to the fullest extent, we need to forget the past, not even lingering in our past experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lingering in our past experiences, however genuine they are, frustrates our further pursuing of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must be the wise virgins, redeeming the time to be filled with the Spirit, and the faithful slaves, using the Lord s gift to the fullest extent, so that we can participate in the Lord s joy in the coming kingdom Matt 25:2-4, 22-23.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To live in the reality of the kingdom, we must exercise to be poor in spirit, to be pure in heart, and to have the righteousness which exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees Matt 5:3, 8, 20.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To live in the reality of the kingdom, we must forgive others Matt 18:21-22, 35; Eph 4:32; 5:2 and seek forgiveness from others Matt 5:23-24 .</S>
