The fellowship contained in the following pages became the governing principles by which many have learned to serve in the church life
The first principle in New Testament service is that this service is absolutely different from the old way of religion
If we would spend time to read the Old Testament carefully, we would be deeply impressed with the service in the Old Testament age
If some of us would migrate to another city to begin the church life there, we should not try to do something in a great way
For a virgin to conceive a child is against the natural concept and against all the knowledge the world can offer
The Old Testament service is a service of doing, but the New Testament service is a service of conceiving and bringing forth Christ
We should not visit others in a natural way; our visiting should be something newly and instantly initiated by God
While the people were paying their attention to the priests and the leaders, God went to one little virgin to have a new beginning
When the Pharisees were arguing with the Lord Jesus concerning the matter of divorce He told them that from the beginning it has not been so
It is not something of knowledge, letters, regulations, thinking, imaginations, or dreams, but of the Holy Spirit
It is not something conceived of knowledge about certain things, and it is not something conceived of the environment or of circumstances
It is something conceived of the Holy Spirit, something which is apparently against nature, culture, and teaching
A virgin like Mary is not strong, experienced, or preoccupied, but so weak, so young, so keen, so fresh, and so open
The Lord will send Gabriel to us with good news, and we will be commissioned to conceive something holy of the Holy Spirit
Our service will bring forth the saving power, the greatness of Christ, the kingship of Christ, and the corporate Emmanuel
What we have pointed out in the preceding chapter can be summarized as four main principles of New Testament service
As we mentioned, the first instance in the New Testament is the birth of Jesus Christ, showing us the principles of New Testament service
When he was met by the Lord, however, he was delivered out of religion and was through with all the traditions
Even the place where Jesus was brought up was not a great religious center like Jerusalem, but a despised region and a little town
Today there is much religious service and work carried on in a way that is contrary to the principles of Christ's birth
When others ask what kind of a work we are doing and what church we go to, it may sometimes be difficult to answer
It begins with the birth of Christ in chapter one, and it ends with the church going forth to meet Christ in chapter twenty-five
If we are not virgins, we have nothing to do with Christ, and if we are not virgins, we have nothing to do with the church
In the New Testament service there should be the freshness of a virgin, with nothing old, religious, or traditional
Everything should be so young, so new, so fresh, so up-to-date, and so much against culture, human nature, and even the natural law
At the time of the birth of Christ, the problem was the Jewish religion, but today it is the Christian religion
One day, however, when the New Testament way was revealed to him, all the religion and all the traditions passed away
If they would pray-read the Word, what a difference it would make, and what a change would take place in their lives!
The religious and traditional people, however, do not like anything new; therefore, they do not like pray-reading
If we avoid offending people by not speaking about anything new then we would need to keep all the old things and the recovery would be gone
Suppose that in the time of Martin Luther someone told him not to speak about anything new because it might offend others
All the old things the outdated things the religious and traditional things will be put aside and we will be living active and aggressive
The second principle in the case of the birth of Jesus is that there is no human effort, human strength, human doings, or human working
There is no need for us to do something for the Lord, but there is the need that the Lord work something into us
The New Testament service is not something conceived of teaching, tradition, or religion, but something conceived of the Holy Spirit
When the Spirit comes in to do something in us, then we see that it is altogether different from what we have learned
The New Testament service is a matter of staying in the presence of the Lord, not a matter of learning a certain way
The proper church life in a locality is the saving power of Christ, and God-with-us manifested in a corporate way
When others come into such a church life, they will immediately sense the saving power of Jesus and the presence of God
In the preceding chapters we have seen only Mary's side of the birth of Christ, but there is another aspect-the side of Joseph
With Joseph, there are, in addition, two main aspects in bringing forth Christ, the aspects of coordination and guidance
Not many of those who study the Bible have realized the need of coordination on Joseph's side for the birth of Jesus
Of course, the prophecy that Christ should be called a Nazarene was easily fulfilled, because Mary was living in Nazareth
It is so interesting to see that after the conceiving of Jesus, everything concerning the birth of Jesus was related to Joseph
Because Mary was related to Joseph, both Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem to be registered according to their house and family
While they were there, the days were fulfilled that the child should be delivered, and Christ was born at Bethlehem
The leading and guidance of the Lord's move does not come through you, but through another to whom you are related
The leading came to Joseph, not only for going down to Egypt, but also for coming out of Egypt to return to the land of Israel
While he considered the matter, he received guidance from the Lord to turn from Judea to Galilee and settle in the city of Nazareth
To fulfill the prophecy of the Lord, which means to fulfill the Lord's purpose, requires the coordination of Joseph
Today's problem is that the able persons are not willing to submit to those who are not as able in certain aspects as they are
The wife in the church life may be quite capable; yet she is willing to submit to those who are not so capable, but who have the position
We thank the Lord that many of the blessings that have been brought into the church life have come simply through the proper coordination
We need to realize that we need coordination regardless of how much we are able to do or what kind of position we have
There is the need of Mary in the aspect of the reality of life, and there is also the need of Joseph in the aspect of the position and move
It is only in this way that we could bring forth Christ, that is, by the proper coordination of Mary and Joseph
She had the ability to conceive, but she did not receive any leading from the Lord concerning the necessary moves
Suppose the angel of the Lord were to come to you and tell you to take Mary, who has a child in her womb, as your wife
When we consider all the steps of the Lord's leading with Joseph, we need to realize that not one step was easy for Joseph to take
It was necessary for Joseph to go to the home town of his relatives, and to take with him his future wife who had a child in her womb
After Jesus was born, another leading from the Lord came that Joseph should take the child and his mother to Egypt
Mary and Joseph need to work together to bring forth Christ in an adequate and perfect way to fulfill God's purpose
The New Testament service in the church life is a service of coordination in every step to fulfill the Lord's purpose
We do have an expository note written on the first seventeen verses of Matthew 1, published in Chinese in 1936
In Genesis 22:18a God promised that Christ would be the seed of Abraham through whom the earth will be blessed
The genealogy in Matthew follows the line of Solomon to Christ, whereas the one in Luke follows the line of Nathan to Christ
In the line of Nathan, the genealogy in Luke eventually comes to Heli, who was Mary's father and Joseph's father-in-law
It may have been that Heli died without a son, and therefore his daughter's husband, Joseph, became his son according to law
Christ is the seed of David, but not the seed of Jeconiah; therefore, the curse that fell on Jeconiah has nothing to do with the Lord Jesus
Though anyone born of Joseph was cut off from the royal throne, yet apparently he was still the legal successor to the throne of David
In position Jesus was the son of the legal heir of the throne of David, and in life He is the proper descendant of David
The fulfillment of all the prophecies regarding the birth of Christ was fully accomplished through coordination
No matter how impossible things may seem, when they are brought into the coordination of the church, they become possible
If we mean business to serve the Lord in the New Testament way, there is no other way but the way of coordination
If we would cooperate with God in coordination, we may be assured that this kind of coordination will bring forth Christ to others
After three days of fruitless searching, they returned to Jerusalem and, going to the temple, they found Jesus sitting there
If this were done according to the way of some today, eventually the church in Los Angeles would become a Pauline church
When something wonderful has been raised up and built up through you, the Lord will say that this is the time for you to take your hands off
No doubt they will bring forth something of Christ there in Chicago, and after a number of years, something of Christ will be raised up
When Jesus went forth to minister, Mary and Joseph were not with Him; yet sometimes some of His family followed Him
We need to learn to serve the Lord to bring forth Christ in a solid way, but not one bit should be in our hand
It is not easy to work and yet not keep this work in our hands, and it is even harder to work and leave the work in the hands of others
They knew that no prophet had ever come out of Galilee, and they thought that nothing good could issue from Nazareth
We should keep in mind that the New Testament work is to bring forth something lowly and small, without form and without outward beauty
Many good, sound, and fundamental Christians have come to our meetings and have seen only the outward appearance
The outward appearance of our meetings may not have been what they expected, but surely our meetings are full of God!
When we go to another city we should keep in mind that we need such a coordination the coordination in life and the coordination in position
In the following chapter, Matthew 13, the people said that they all knew His father, His mother, and all His brothers and sisters
When we are faithful to the Lord to bring forth Christ, it is really difficult for us to keep our hands off what we have brought forth
It is rather difficult for any one of us to keep our hands off the work that we have accomplished for the Lord
When we help some saints to grow in life and eventually they have matured, will we be able to keep our hands off?
The Apostle Paul accomplished much work in building up so many local churches, but eventually he was imprisoned
When we were young, many of us attended Sunday schools and in that setting were presented with the Bible as a book of stories
Many Christians make the Bible a story book, and some, especially the great teachers and speakers, make it a book of teachings
In that chapter regarding the genealogy and conceiving of Christ we do have a story and a certain amount of teaching
Merely to hold the Bible in our hand and read Micah 5:2, which indicates that Christ will be born in Bethlehem, does not work
To find and serve Christ according to the principle shown us in Matthew chapter two was not according to the Old Testament Scriptures
Numbers 24:17 says, 'There shall come a Star out of Jacob,' but this star did not appear to any of the people of Jacob
Now consider what the wise men did: they saw the heavenly star and they followed it, but they made a great mistake
They received the vision, but they soon turned to their human concept and exercised their natural understanding
Those who received the vision made a great mistake and, apart from divine intervention, would have caused the loss of the little child Jesus
Herod called the chief priests and scribes of the people together and asked of them where Christ should be born
When the wise men came into religion, they missed the star; but when they left religion, the star appeared to them
Not one found Christ merely according to Bible knowledge; those who followed the heavenly star found Him and worshipped Him
God told His people in His holy writings that Christ would be born in Bethlehem, and all His people received this knowledge
During Mary's pregnancy He was brought to Bethlehem for a short time, not in an ordinary way, but in an extraordinary way
A short time later He was brought away from Bethlehem to Egypt, and then brought out of Egypt to settle in Nazareth and grow up there
Jesus fulfilled the Scriptures by being born in Bethlehem, but we may say that it was done somewhat in a 'sneaky' way
If we have His presence, we will know when He is in Bethlehem, when He goes away, when He comes back, and where He is raised up
What the Lord has been doing throughout history, toward the worldly and religious people, has been hidden and 'sneaky'
We need to learn to praise Him, to see Him, to trace Him, and to find Him, but we should not try to understand Him
Once we knew Christ after the flesh and considered Him the little man of Nazareth, but now we know Him no longer in this way
We should forget about the outward things, forget about the flesh; we need to see the church not after the flesh, but after the spirit
There was gold, there was silver, and there were the precious stones; there was the beauty of the precious things
Outwardly speaking, the church is clothed with badger skin-there is no beauty, but there is toughness and even perhaps wildness
All the main things of the Bible, as a rule, begin in the Old Testament and go right through the New Testament to the end of the Bible
In this book we have Christ as the morning star and those faithful followers of Christ in the churches as the stars
At the beginning of the New Testament the star was outside of religion, but at the end of the New Testament the star is within the church
If you would see the star today, there is no need for you to look to the sky; there is no need for you to do as those wise men did
In the Acts and the Epistles the leading ones were called elders or bishops, but in the last book of the Bible they are the stars
None of the leading ones in the local churches should claim their position they should not say I am one of the elders you must recognize me
It is by the shining in today's darkness that people receive the guidance and are turned from the wrong way to the right way
In every local church there is a star: in every local church there is something shining, leading people to the right way
Praise the Lord that today we are not in the age of Matthew 1 and 2, but in the age of the book of Revelation, in the local churches
We should take heed to the words of the Bible until something as phosphorous rises within us-that is, Christ as the morning star
We should take heed to the sure Word until it rises within us as Christ, as the phosphorous, as the day breaking through the darkness
To have the Bible in our hands is one thing; to take heed to the Word until the morning star rises in our heart is another
What we need today is to take the Word into us, to take heed to the living Word until something within rises and shines in our heart
Other times, however, when we open our heart and take heed to this sure Word, something within is shining, rising, dawning, breaking through
The situation may not be bright, the surroundings may be full of darkness, but something within is enlightening, shining, filling with glory
If we have the living Word as the morning star rising within us and we are one with the seven Spirits, eventually we will become the stars
We not only have the star shining within us, but by looking to the star and following in the Spirit we become the stars
The Lord said unto Abraham, 'I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore'
Those persons may have the knowledge of the Bible, but the more they talk with you, the more you feel imprisoned
There is no tag attached to him saying, 'I am a heavenly star,' but when you meet him, you simply have the sense of shining
Another brother, however, may answer that he simply does not know the answer, but while he is speaking, you sense that he is crystal clear
No word can express it, but while you are with him, you begin to be clear, and you know what to do about your marriage
They themselves are wandering: they have no ground, they have no standing, they have no certain way to go on with the Lord
Anyone who keeps us from the genuine local church and from meeting on the ground of unity with the Lord's people is a wandering star
The true stars are those who turn many to righteousness, those who do not lead people astray, but turn them to the right way
May the Lord be merciful to us that we may always be kept in the right way to serve the Lord, to worship Him, and to offer our love to Him
The heathen wise men were the first ones to find Christ, and John the Baptist was the first one to testify of Christ
The New Testament tells us that from the time John was conceived in his mother's womb, he was filled with the Holy Spirit
As you know, from the time of the vision concerning John's birth, Zachariah had been unable to speak because of his unbelief
The Gospels tell us that he wore a garment of camel's hair, even though Leviticus 11 tells us that camels are unclean
John the Baptist, who was the first witness, the first martyr of Christ, kept nothing of religion and nothing of culture
John did not teach from any book of the Bible, he did not teach any commandment, and he did not teach any part of the law
In the entire Old Testament you cannot find such a prophecy, for the baptism of John was something entirely new
They dared not say that John's baptism was of man lest they risk being stoned, for the multitude recognized John as a prophet
Neither could they say that it was of heaven, because the Lord would then ask them why they did not believe it
He indicated that we should repent, change our mind, change our concept, because the kingdom of the heavens is coming
We need to turn from the mere Bible knowledge, from the teaching, the doctrines of letters, to the Lord Himself
The people in John's day needed to turn to the Lord from the law, the temple, the altar, the offerings, and all the religious things
John did very little teaching he simply told people to change to turn to get themselves ready for the kingdom of the heavens and for Christ
When John says, 'Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near,' he is saying that we need to repent because Christ is here
For this reason some have tried to make the matter of baptism more cultured by using a little bowl with some water in it
Mary conceived and brought forth Christ outside of Judaism, and the heathen wise men found Christ outside of Judaism
He did not care for religion or culture, but this does not mean that he was fighting against religion and culture
He was outside of religion for Christ, and he had nothing to do with religion because it keeps people away from Christ
He was not different from religion and culture merely for the sake of being different, but he was different for Christ's sake
He was negative toward his home, his family, the temple, Jerusalem, the Jewish religion, and the Jewish culture
To abandon religion and culture for Christ is not at all the same as giving up religion and culture without a purpose
Even our spiritual seeking can be a substitute for the Lord if we care more for our spiritual seeking than for Christ
It is possible for our spiritual seeking to replace Christ so that we love our spiritual seeking much more than we love Christ Himself
If we merely try to teach her in this way, it may be that we ourselves have not come under the heavenly ruling of God
If we help others with the concept of being good rather than evil, we fail to bring them under the heavenly ruling
What matters is not how good we are or how well we behave ourselves in our family, but whether or not we are under God's ruling
It is not a matter of why we cannot do certain things, but altogether a matter of whether or not we are under the ruling of the heavens
If we will simply turn to the Lord and be under His heavenly reign, we will see that it really works for us to call on His name
After testifying that we need to be in the right position, John's first point concerning Christ is that He is the Son of God
If we would believe in Christ, we need to believe in these two things: His redemption and His baptism in the Holy Spirit
We simply read in the Word that we have been sprinkled with the Lord's blood, and we take this matter by faith
The church should henceforth testify for Christ that He is not only the Lamb of God, but also the Baptizer with the Holy Spirit
As the Redeemer, He has accomplished redemption, and as the Baptizer, He has accomplished the baptism in the Holy Spirit
If we keep our work for the Lord in our own hands as our own increase, we will not allow Christ to have the increase
We need to consider what happened to John the Baptist after he said that he must decrease and Christ must increase
Eventually He becomes the Bridegroom, and whatever we have worked out will become His bride, the church, which is His increase
We should not labor with some expectation of a reward at our retirement, for the church will reward us with a decrease
Following the case of John the Baptist is the fourth case in Matthew, the case of the disciples following Christ
Matthew put all the facts together under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit for a definite purpose, not according to chronological order
Because Matthew is a book that has been written according to doctrinal arrangement, we need to understand this book in such a way
He departed from Jerusalem, the temple, the Jewish religion, and the political center to Galilee of the Gentiles
When Jesus departed from Jerusalem to Galilee of the Gentiles, the Bible says that He was a great light springing up in darkness
He did not appear to those in Jerusalem, He did not appear to those in the temple, but He appeared to those in Galilee of the Gentiles
In 1 Corinthians 110 this word is translated attuned the only difference being that one is in the active voice and the other in the passive
In 1 Thessalonians 3:10 this word is translated 'perfect,' that we may 'perfect what is lacking in your faith'
Galatians 6:1 says, 'If ever a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness'
Why did Matthew mention these four persons in giving us a record of those whom Jesus had called to follow Him?
If we read the New Testament, we will see that Peter was the first in the New Testament ministry and that John was the last
We need to realize that while Peter and Andrew were fishing and James and John were mending, there were many priests praying in the temple
The Lord is doing a work to build up His New Jerusalem-this is His ultimate intention, and this is what He cares for
For the completion of His building He needs to have fishers to bring in the materials and menders to build up the materials into a building
We prayed that the Lord would bring in more Ezras with more groups of people, and the Lord has answered our prayers
We need the menders to attune them, to prepare them, to feed them, to bring them up, and to add something more of Christ to them
Outwardly, we are mere human beings, but inwardly we have the life-giving Spirit, and we have been baptized into the Holy Spirit
The last book of John's ministry is the book of Revelation, and that book is the ultimate consummation of God's building
Peter was the first apostle in the New Testament service, and John was the last one recorded in the New Testament
These two, the fishing and the mending, are the main ministries in the New Testament service in following the Lord Jesus
Although John's ministry was the building, he was the writer of one of the Gospels, and his Gospel also speaks about reaping the harvest
In too many cases, however, the matter of fishing is given full attention, and there is very little mending, if any
To pile material up requires no mending, but to build up that material requires much mending, perfecting, equipping, and attuning
Eventually, all the followers of this great light became the light, because the great light had been wrought into them
We need to be attracted by His shining, and we need to be transformed by His shining so that we become the light
The disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?
Now no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment and a worse tear is made
Not only the Pharisees became religious, but even the disciples of the forerunner of the New Testament service also became religious
The disciples of John even took the lead to speak to the Lord and say Why do we and the Pharisees fast much but Your disciples do not fast
We believe God is for fasting and prayers, but we are certain He would not care for what Your disciples are doing'
If we simply maintain what we are doing now for a long period of time, we will become the disciples of John, not the followers of Jesus
When we have the Bridegroom feasting with us, and we are covered with the new garment and filled with the new wine, how could we fast?
While the Lord Jesus was on this earth, what He was and what He did was somewhat like an untreated, unfulled cloth
Before His death and resurrection, He was a piece of new cloth, not treated, not dressed, not completed for wearing
We could not damage Him, but our old garment would be damaged by our trying to use Him as the new cloth to patch it
He was a piece of new cloth, but now He is no longer a piece of unfinished new cloth; He is a completed new garment that we can put on
In so doing they are simply cutting out a piece of the Lord Jesus as the new cloth to put upon their old garment to patch up the holes
Neither should we cut a piece of this complete garment to patch the holes of our old garment, for that will simply damage the old garment
The Lord, in effect, was telling the disciples of John and the Pharisees: 'Do not cut Me out and apply Me to your old religion
The Lord used not only the new cloth and the new garment to illustrate something of Himself, but also the new wine
If we have only the outward garment, we are like the prodigal son in Luke 15 before the father killed the fatted calf
He did not care so much for the outward garment; he wanted something to eat and drink to be satisfied inwardly
Praise the Lord, after speaking about the new garment, the Lord spoke of the new wine, which is Himself as our inner life
The disciples of John and the Pharisees had come to the Lord to ask Him about fasting and praying, and the Lord spoke of the new wineskin
John Wesley, however, preached on the street corners and in the open air, and his ministry brought a great revival
He is the new cloth, He is the new garment, He is the new wine, and He, enlarged in a corporate way, is the new wineskin
The new cloth is for making the new garment, and this is Christ for the outward covering, the expression outwardly
We have Christ as the new wine, satisfying us within, and we have Christ as the new garment, expressing Himself through us
Christ is our expression outwardly and our inner life, and this inner life should be contained in the church life
The Lord spoke such simple parables, yet they contained all the main points of God's mystery and God's eternal purpose
They were short illustrations concerning four new things, but they contained the mystery of Christ and the church
The past, but many times what has helped us in the past is the very thing that frustrates us from going on in the present
On one hand, we appreciate the old things that have helped us, but on the other hand, we should be willing to drop them for something new
We need to remember the principle that all those who have been drinking the old wine will say that the old is better
He is an up-to-date and ever-present Christ, a Christ always new in nature, completely different from the old things
We need to be clear that the New Testament service is always outside of religion, having nothing to do with the old system
If we try to take something of the Lord Jesus to fit our old religion we are using the new cloth or the new garment to patch our old garment
By the Lord's mercy we need to drop the old garment and put on the new garment, and we need to put the new wine into the new wineskin
It is not a matter of religion, not something old, but a matter of the proper church life, something so new in nature for Christ to dwell in
All of these cases have illustrated clearly, adequately, and completely that the New Testament service is outside of religion
Some may say that this is simply our way to interpret these four cases; therefore, we do need confirmation from the Lord's own teaching
By this we will see that the way we have interpreted these four cases is soundly confirmed by the Lord's teaching
In the above passages, there are four cases that reveal something of the Lord's teaching concerning the New Testament service
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a wine drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners
By looking at the way he ate, drank, and lived, they thought that he had lost his mind and that he was possessed by a demon
We may think that it would be better to compromise a little and to be somewhere in the middle, not at either extreme
Because we have the life of Christ, we do not need to go along with any outward rules, but we need to go along with His life within us
Gentlemen condemn the hippies, and the hippies condemn the gentlemen, but we do not condemn anyone, nor do we justify anyone
If you consider yourself a gentleman, you may see all the hippies among us and think that we are a 'hippy-church'
You need to take note that we also have many so-called gentlemen among us, but this does not mean that we are a gentleman-church
Then with John the Baptist is a case showing us that the proper Christian life is outside of religion and culture
At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the grainfields; and His disciples were hungry and began to pick the ears and to eat
The Pharisees seeing it said to Him, Behold, your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath
Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?
Jesus and His disciples went into the wheat field, and the disciples plucked the ears of wheat and ate to satisfy their hunger
We should not think that it was merely a coincidence that the Lord Jesus allowed His disciples to do such a thing on the Sabbath
Because the Pharisees asked regarding eating on the Sabbath, the Lord Jesus referred to David and his followers
According to the regulation of the Pharisees, people must keep the Sabbath, and they must keep it without eating this way
When the Pharisees said that this was unlawful, Jesus answered them by asking, 'Have you not read what David did'?
In the answer of the Lord Jesus to the religious people, there is the implication that the dispensation has been changed
To keep the Sabbath was a rule of the dispensation of the priests, but the dispensation of the priests is over
It is now the dispensation of the king; therefore, there is no need for anyone to keep the regulation of the old dispensation
The Sabbath-keeping law was something of the dispensation of the priests, but now the dispensation of the king has come
Have you not read in the law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless'?
Outside of the temple, people needed to keep the Sabbath law, but when they were in the temple, they were freed from that law
Some may say that such a thing is not scriptural, but we need to look at so many dead ones who have become alive by being buried
Should we think that the Lord cares for religious service without life, although it seems to be fundamental and scriptural?
The unique sign of this age is for Christ to die on the cross and rise again that He might release us in resurrection
We first need to experience Christ as the dead and resurrected Jonah, and then we can experience Him as the wise Solomon
He is the One who brings us into death and brings us out of death in resurrection, and He is also the One who judges and discerns within us
For Christ to be greater than Solomon means that He is the One who has been entrusted with all of God's economy
We can see by all these cases that the New Testament service is outside of religion, but altogether with Christ
In the first chapter of Matthew we have seen the conceiving of Christ, and in the second chapter, the finding of Christ
There is the conceiving of Christ, the finding of Christ, the testifying of Christ, and the following of Christ, but who is Christ?
Peter, James, and John, with the others, were all followers of Christ, but there was nevertheless the problem of who Christ is
When we are in the religious district, the religious sphere, it is doubtful that we will ask questions about Christ
Once we move outside of the religious world and the religious circle, immediately the question comes, 'What about Christ'?
The reason is that the New Testament service is outside of the religious region, the religious circle, the religious sphere
Jesus said to him You are blessed Simon Barjona because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but My Father who is in the heavens
The Lord told him that his answer was not of flesh and blood, but it was something that had been revealed from the Father in the heavens
In the following chapter, the Lord Jesus brought Peter, James, and John up to a mountain, where suddenly He was transfigured before them
Not only did Peter receive a revelation in chapter sixteen, but in chapter seventeen he also saw a transfiguration with his physical eyes
We need to hear the living Christ, not merely the written law represented by Moses, nor the written prophets represented by Elijah
We should realize that Peter had suggested putting up three tabernacles, one for Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elijah
There is another portion in Matthew 17, a portion describing another event which occurred a short time after the transfiguration
And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the half-shekel came to Peter and said, Does not your teacher pay the half-shekel?
Peter was careless, not paying attention to what had been revealed to him, nor to what he had seen in the vision of the transfiguration
Many times we may have seen the vision, and we may even have heard the voice, but we simply do not apply what we have seen and heard
Such a thing happens because, on the one hand, you have seen the vision, but, on the other hand, you are still in the old tradition
We feel that we still remember what we have seen, but the Holy Spirit sends the tax collector in an unexpected way
He should not have answered according to tradition, because he had seen the vision and heard the voice from the heavens
It is not such a simple lesson to learn to do whatever the Lord says, regardless of what He has said in the past
The Lord said that He would pay the tribute to keep from offending the others, but He would not give money to Peter for him to pay it
Peter needed to go fishing to find some money in the mouth of a fish, money that would be sufficient for both the Lord and himself
It was by such a simple matter that the Lord caused Peter to know that today it is not Moses who gives the commandment, but Jesus
Now to pay the poll tax is not a matter of keeping the law of Moses, but a matter of keeping the word of Christ
Either way, the case is in His hand, because today He is the living Law-giver; therefore, whatever He says is right
Christ is not only the present Moses, but He is also today's Prophet, the Prophet who is living in our daily life
He does not give a lot of teaching and doctrine, but He gives simply a little prediction with a living instruction
We do not need a great prophecy that has no meaning, but we need a few little words that teach us some lesson and supply some need
The fourth question was asked by one of the Pharisees, who was a lawyer, a learned one with knowledge of the Scriptures
All of these leading ones with their high attainments, knowledge, power, and position surrounded the Lord Jesus to entangle Him
They reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
If we say that John's baptism is from man, we will offend the people, because they all regard John as a prophet'
If the Lord said they should not pay, then the Herodians would immediately charge Him with being against the Roman government
The Sadducees, somewhat like today's modernists, prided themselves in their knowledge; they came to Him and asked a question
Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies not having children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother
The Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection; therefore, they thought they could catch Jesus with this question
In other words, if Jesus said that there was a resurrection, whose wife would this woman be in the resurrection?
Jesus answered the lawyer, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them, saying, What do you think concerning the Christ?
Those trying to entangle the Lord had asked questions concerning religion, politics, faith, and the interpretation of the Scriptures
They were correct concerning the knowledge in their mind, but there was nothing of the heavenly vision in their spirit
How many dear ones have been distracted, frustrated, and kept away from Christ by the mere knowledge of the Bible!
We should be careful not to let the knowledge of the Bible frustrate us, distract us, or keep us away from Christ
Let us forget about politics, beliefs, and the interpretation of the Bible, but let us not at all forget about Christ Himself
Speaking in faithfulness, we respect it even more than many others, but we do so in the presence of the Lord and under His anointing
Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom
For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps
The prudent answered, saying, Lest there be not enough for us and for you, go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves
As they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut'
In this parable of the virgins, the Lord is not speaking of individual virgins, but He is saying something about a group of virgins
We need to realize that we should not try to be a separate individual, loving the Lord and living for the Lord
The one that conceived Christ of the Holy Spirit was a virgin, and the corporate ones moving together are also virgins
The lamp mentioned here was an oil lamp; therefore, there was the need of a vessel along with the lamp to contain an extra portion of oil
We may all have been regenerated of the Holy Spirit, but so many of us are not filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit
Regeneration is sufficient to save us, but we need the infilling of the Holy Spirit to be ready to meet the Bridegroom
The parable of the ten virgins is not a matter of salvation; it is a matter of being prepared for the wedding feast of Christ
Suppose you go to the department store and select an item for purchase, but the Spirit within tells you to drop it
We are children of God, we have been regenerated, but the problem is that we will not pay the price by dropping so many things
For it is as a man who, going into another country, called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions
To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability; and he went into another country
It was in a similar way that the Lord gave us four words that have become rich and wonderful to us in these days O Lord Amen Hallelujah!
