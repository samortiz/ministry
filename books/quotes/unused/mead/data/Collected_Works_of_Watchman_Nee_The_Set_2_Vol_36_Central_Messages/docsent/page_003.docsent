   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE OVERCOMING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Last Lord's Day, we saw that it is possible for every Christian to have a life that is perfect see "The Extent of the Believer's Salvation," Collected Works, Volume 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is possible for him to have a pure conscience, a clean heart, and to be anxious for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is possible for his mind to be single and undistracted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is possible for him to obey God and love Him absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is possible for him to overcome whatever peculiar physical constitution he has, and to present his members as weapons of righteousness to God unto sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every Christian can reach the point where he can say that he is crucified with Christ and that it is no longer he who lives, but Christ who lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is possible and attainable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today I will speak on another subject, which is the way to obtain the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. THE LIFE CHRIST LIVED WHILE HE WAS ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Christ lived on the earth, He was absolutely obedient to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had absolutely no love for the world, and He did not speak or walk according to His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He never allowed any temptation to overcome Him, and He never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was obedient to God unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But how about us?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Have we obeyed God absolutely?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No. Have we denied our self-will completely? No. Are we sinless? No. Are we totally free from the love of the world? We may not love the world outwardly, but our heart loves it secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Has anyone here never been shaken by any temptation?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No. This is terrible! According to the Bible, a Christian should obey God absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He should not love the world or go along with his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He should not sin at all or be shaken by any temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But brothers and sisters, both you and I have to confess that this is impossible!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have been Christians for more than one or two years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some of us may even have been Christians for three, four, or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where have we been successful during these years?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We often repent, feel remorseful, or even weep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But where is our victory?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We know the standard of a Christian set forth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must absolutely deny our self, we must be righteous as God is righteous, and we must pursue after the kingdom with singleness of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But what is our real condition?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We often sin, our hearts are unclean, and we still lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We love the world secretly, and we are controlled by our lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not like to read the Bible or pray, and sometimes we almost think that it would be better if we were not Christians at all.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible says that we "ought to," but we say that we "cannot."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Truly, we always "ought to," but it is also true that we forever "cannot."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Can we lower the standard of God's truth?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Can we say that it is all right for us to sin just once?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Can we say that some should love God, obey God, deny themselves, and be holy, but that this standard is not necessarily for everyone, but only for a few special ones?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brothers and sisters, we have seen that although we cannot make it in ourselves, there is One who has made it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This One is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We ought to be perfect, but we cannot be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet Christ has made it; He is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This shows us three things:</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1 The standard which God has set for our living is something which every Christian should be able to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>2 However, we cannot meet this standard.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>3 Throughout history, only one person made it Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do we believe that we cannot make it?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do we believe that Christ has made it?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of us must admit that we ought to make it, but we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we also must admit that Christ has made it all the way to perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What then does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A standard of living that is according to God can only be lived out by God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is true because God is higher than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But this would be true even if God were lower than us; there must be the same kind of life in order to have the same kind of living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only a bird can live a bird's life, and only a beast can live a beast's life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, only God can live God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since Christ is God, only He can live out God's life.</S>
