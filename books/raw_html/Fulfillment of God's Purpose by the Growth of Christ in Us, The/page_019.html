<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEING SAVED AND RENEWED<br>BY CHRIST AS LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10; 6:4; Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:22-24, 15-16; 2:21; Col. 2:19; 1 Pet. 2:2, 5</H1><P>Thus far, we have seen the way to take life in and how life grows and transforms us. In this chapter we want to see something more about life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SAVED IN HIS LIFE</H2><P>Romans 5:10 says, "Much more we will be saved in His life." Life grows, life transforms, and life saves. We all have to pay our full attention to Romans 5:10. It says that when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God. To be reconciled to God is good, but we still need something more, much more. Much more we will be saved in His life. Once we were enemies to God and were absolutely fallen. In one sense, even today while we are here on this earth and in this flesh, we are still in a fallen condition, a fallen situation, and a fallen nature. So we need to be saved.</P><P>We need to spend time in the presence of the Lord to pray, "O Lord Jesus, show me the items from which I need to be saved." You may say that you need to be saved from self, Satan, and the power of sin. But if you ask the Lord, He will show you hundreds of items from which you need to be saved.</P><P>One thing from which we need to be saved is our looseness. This looseness comes not from God's original creation but from our fall. To be loose proves that we are fallen. An example of our looseness is that we are not accurate when we report something. We may say that there were about one thousand people present in one of our meetings, but our report is exaggerated. We need to be saved from our looseness and from many other things.</P><P>We have been saved from eternal perdition and from God's condemnation, but we are fallen people, and all of the things related to us are in a fallen condition. The way we talk is fallen, the way we express ourselves is fallen, our attitude is fallen, and our talk is fallen. Even the way we walk is fallen. The way we dress and cut our hair is fallen. The way we laugh and shout is fallen. The way we look at people is fallen. Whatever we do, whatever we are, whatever we have, whatever we say, and however we behave are altogether fallen. Our conduct is absolutely a fallen matter. Since it is fallen, we need salvation; we need deliverance.</P><P>We need to be delivered from the way we talk to people, from the way we laugh, and from the way we express ourselves. We need to be delivered from the way we dress. Now that we have been reconciled, much more we will be saved in His life. In the fallen situation, Satan is subtle with certain persons in one aspect and with other persons in another aspect. Some people are wild. Wildness is a proof of the fall. We are wild because we are fallen, so we need to be saved from being wild. But this does not mean that we should be refined. To be refined is a matter of culture. Some people may be refined without, but within they are like wild beasts. We all need to be saved by His life. When we call on the Lord by saying, "Lord Jesus," we take Him in as life, and this life saves us from being wild or from our natural refinement.</P>
