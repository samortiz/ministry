   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY PREPARED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God did many things to make it possible for us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He had to create the heavens, the earth, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then He Himself had to become incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The infinite God lived in humanity for thirty-three and a half years!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then one day He went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God in the flesh entered into death by crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After death, He entered into resurrection, ascension, enthronement, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now our God has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is ready to enter into all those who open up to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"O God, I am a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>O Lord Jesus, You are My Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You died on the cross for me."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whoever opens himself to this extent will have this life-giving One enter into the inmost part of him, his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He comes into us with all His involvements and all His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His involvements include eternity, creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, with the enthronement and the crowning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is our God, our Redeemer, our Savior, our Lord, our Master, and our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His virtues include life, light, love, grace, truth, holiness, righteousness, victory, and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This life-giving Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The two spirits are mingled, making us one spirit with the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In ourselves we are sinful and insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are nobodies in a vast universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet we are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This profound fact should be a factor affecting our living.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ today is both in the heavens and in us, just as electricity is in the power plant and also in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is prevailing in us because He is in the power plant of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the message you need to tell people!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You are the Lord's spokesman to tell others that He is living, real, available, and within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Have you ever told your parents this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You are silent and passive because you do not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is living!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Pray to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you pray even for a half hour, you will see what happens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The motor within will start up!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God" Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a wonder that the divine Spirit is one with our human spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How can we live by Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is simply by walking according to this mingled spirit which is within us Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Our Relationships with Others</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose two brothers come to me after they have had a disagreement.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They tell me their story and want me to settle the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I can handle them in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I can listen to them, trying to discern which one is right.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I watch their eyes and their facial expressions to be sure they are not lying.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this is my way of dealing with people, I am living by myself; this is a human way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The other way is to listen while inwardly I am praying.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"Lord, I would live by You.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have been crucified with You.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now You live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What would You say to these brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What do You realize concerning them?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What would You do with them?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This constant, inward turning to the Lord is what is meant by praying unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Not only so.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have my natural discernment, by which I could read their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But I further say to the Lord, "Lord, I do not want to live by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I want to go by what You feel, what You discern, what You see.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I want to say what You would say to them."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose, further, that while the brothers are talking to me, my temper is aroused by what they say.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am about to rebuke them, but I sense that I am not abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this situation I do not do or say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, within I pray, "Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>My natural man has come to the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Lord, cover me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Be my person.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Be my life."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After I have been listening to these two brothers in an attitude of prayer and oneness with the Lord, He will lead me to say a word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What it would be, I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord is living and flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whatever He would say through me will be either light shining over them or life supplied to them within.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The result will be that both of them are enlightened, nourished, and supplied with life.</S>
