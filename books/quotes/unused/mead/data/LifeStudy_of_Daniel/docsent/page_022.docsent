   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DANIEL MESSAGE SIX THE VICTORY OF THE YOUNG DESCENDANTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD'S DEGRADED ELECT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OVER SATAN'S FURTHER DEVICES 4 OVER THE COVERING THAT HINDERS PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FROM SEEING THE RULING OF THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>BY THE GOD OF THE HEAVENS Scripture Reading: Dan 4</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Daniel is a book of the divine revelation concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapters one through six, this book does not present God's economy in theology or in teaching but in a series of cases.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are at least six cases recorded in Daniel 1 6 which show us what God's economy is and how God's economy can be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These six cases are illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apparently the cases in chapters one through six stand alone and have nothing to do with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually these cases are all connected.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, to find the crucial point of the second case, the great human image in chapter two, we must go back to chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The secret of understanding chapter two is in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, the secret of understanding chapter three is in chapter two, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The case in chapter six is a conclusion to the five foregoing cases.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to describe the first case, in chapter one, we must paint a portrait.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, we must portray the figure of a fighting, overcoming general, Nebuchadnezzar, who has just returned from Jerusalem to Babylon with many captives following behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second, we see four brilliant young men among the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Third, these young men are specially chosen from among the captives and then presented with the king's choice food.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Fourth, they set their hearts to keep themselves for God, and they reject the royal food and eat vegetables only.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, the four become very pleasant, happy, and healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then as a result, God's presence, wisdom, and insight are with them, and they can understand things ten times better than all the others in Nebuchadnezzar's realm.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second case is in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That great, victorious general dreamed a dream that he could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because he was blinded by worldly glory and power, he could not understand the dream and eventually forgot it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, there was a person named Daniel who did not care for worldly glory and power, who had a heart for God, and who had the ability and the capacity to understand this dream.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had not only the right position and the right angle to understand but also an intrinsic capacity in his being to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, when such an unknown matter was brought to him, he had the insight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He saw through the worldly glory and majesty related to human government.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then he gave the king a vision to open his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Nebuchadnezzar was void of the capacity to know God inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although outwardly he was helped by Daniel to see that God is the Most High God, nothing within him was touched.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regarding Daniel as a hero, this great, overcoming general worshipped him and offered him an oblation with incense.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the scene at the end of chapter two.</S>
