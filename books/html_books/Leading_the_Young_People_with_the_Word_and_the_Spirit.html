<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book contains a series of messages released by Brother Witness Lee to a group of saints serving with the young people in Taipei, from March to September of 1961. These messages are included in chapters 1 through 12. It also contains messages given during a young people&#8217;s conference held in Hong Kong in July and August of 1959. These messages are included in chapters 13 and 14.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EMPHASIZING BOTH KNOWLEDGE AND LIFE<br />
IN OUR LEADING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: March 10, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FIVE MATTERS IN LEADING THE YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In our fellowship concerning how to lead the young people, we need to look at five matters. First, the serving ones should focus on the material and skills needed in the work with the young people. We should study and discuss the material to use in the young people&rsquo;s meeting and whether the material that we used in the past is appropriate and practical. If a businessman wants to manufacture a good product, he must conduct substantial research in order to have the proper skills to make a product. Similarly, we need to study and find the most effective way to work with the young people. This cannot be worked out in a short period of time. We need to study together and experiment in various places to see whether a particular way is practical and effective. Then we should follow up with more study and improvement.</p>
<p>Second, we need materials, including outlines, sections, and lines of study. We hope that the serving ones will consider the matter of materials thoughtfully and use them in a flexible way after digesting and assimilating them. Third, the serving ones must learn some hymns, because there is a need to lead the young people to sing in the meetings. Hence, the serving ones must familiarize themselves with the hymns that the young people sing. Fourth, the serving ones must pray much for the young people. Fifth, the serving ones must learn to blend together in spirit. When we come together, we should not behave as if we were sitting in a meeting of a secular academic organization, waiting for others to speak and taking notes. Every meeting should be an opportunity to fellowship and blend in spirit. We should be free to open our spirit and fellowship our feelings and problems. When we pray, we should release our spirit without hesitation. We should learn these five matters in order to lead the young people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BRIEF HISTORY OF<br />
THE YOUNG PEOPLE&rsquo;S WORK AMONG US</h2>
<p>The young people&rsquo;s work among us began in 1935 or 1936. Before 1936 there was not much work with the young people. In 1932 Watchman Nee went to Tsinan, the capital of Shantung Province, and preached the gospel to a group of medical students at Cheloo University, and many were saved. Shortly thereafter, a group of believers began to meet in Tsinan. This was the first time that there was a work among the young people. However, the scope of the work was not big, because it was limited to the medical school in Tsinan.</p>
<p>In 1936 we began to work more aggressively with the young people in Beijing. Before the Japanese army invaded China, the top educational center was in Beijing, where the largest number of students and the best universities were located. At that time the Lord opened a door to some of the best universities in Beijing. The first door opened to us was at Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). At that time, PUMC was a renowned medical school in the world. Many of the nurses there were sisters, and some students and doctors also began to meet with us. At the same time two very good national universities, Tsinghua and Yenching, were also opened to us by the Lord. From that time onward, I began to bear a substantial burden for the young people&rsquo;s work. Later the work continued to spread among the young people. However, the work was mainly among vocational nursing schools, and there were quite a number of nurses among us who were sisters. In Tientsin, Tsinan, Shanghai, Nanking, and Soochow, nursing students were the main target of our work among the young people.</p>
<p>From 1946 through 1948 the young people&rsquo;s work in Shanghai expanded and became more solid. At that time there were quite a number of young brothers studying in Chiao-tung University. In addition to this school, there were students at Shanghai Medical College and the National Defense Medical Center in Shanghai. The Lord also opened the door to Central University, and many were brought to salvation. In this way we gained experience and knowledge concerning how to choose the right material and how to apply the proper skills.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE YOUNG PEOPLE&rsquo;S WORK<br />
HAVING A BRIGHT FUTURE</h2>
<p>After we came to Taiwan, the brothers began to work with the young people. In the beginning I was with the brothers in their fellowship. As I became busy with other matters, however, I was not involved in the young people&rsquo;s work very much. In recent years the young people&rsquo;s work in Taipei has developed, and the burden for the work has increased greatly. Therefore, the elders feel that we should consider the needs in this work.</p>
<p>Whenever I go abroad, whether to Manila or Hong Kong, and wherever there is a large local church, I encourage them to pay more attention to the young people&rsquo;s work. In recent years many young people have been gained by the Lord in Manila. The situation in Hong Kong is also good. During this past winter, the number in the young people&rsquo;s meeting in Hong Kong reached nearly three hundred. The church in Hong Kong is smaller than the church in Taipei; nevertheless, they have gained over two hundred fifty students. The church in Hong Kong continues to preach the gospel to young people because gaining students has a long-term effect. Once a student is gained, the growth can be endless. When a student is gained, he can gain two or three of his fellow students, and these two or three can gain some as well. Thus, the number can continue to multiply. Furthermore, when young people are gained by the Lord, they also affect their families.</p>
<p>All the serving ones know that there is a bright future in the young people&rsquo;s work. The young ones who are fifteen years old now will be very useful in ten years. Then after another ten years, some who are thirty-five will be ready to be elders in the church. The future is unlimited. The Chinese have a saying that the young generation holds a vast potential for greatness; this is surely true. The saints who are in their fifties are often set in their ways; it is not so easy for them to change. The young people, however, can be raised up relatively quickly to be productive. This is the reason we should pay attention to the young people&rsquo;s work.</p><h2 class="head1">FOCUSING EQUALLY ON KNOWLEDGE AND LIFE<br />
IN OUR LEADING</h2>
<p>According to our experience, we must impart spiritual content into our young people. This spiritual content must be related to spiritual knowledge on one hand and to spiritual life on the other hand. These two aspects are indispensable in leading the young people. We should not lean too much toward knowledge or too much toward life; we must be balanced. Those who serve the Lord know that according to God&rsquo;s law in the universe, everything is balanced. The more we touch the Lord&rsquo;s service, the more we realize that something is effective only when it is balanced. For example, God created man with two hands and two feet. There are countless other examples of balance in the universe. For instance, in a family there is a husband and a wife, and in society there are men and women; this brings balance to human situations.</p>
<p>In our work and in the administration of the church, we should keep the principle of being balanced. In the Old Testament God used the kingship and the priesthood to rule over His people. The priesthood balanced the kingship, and fellowship balanced authority. Today we should lead the children of God in the same way. I treasure very much what the apostles said in Acts 6:4: &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; The apostles did not just give messages to care for the ministry of the word; they also continued steadfastly in prayer. Their service was balanced.</p>
<p>In our service with the young brothers and sisters, we should keep the principle of being balanced; we must instruct them in matters related to spiritual knowledge and to spiritual life. We should not focus on knowledge and then on life; rather, we should give the young people knowledge and life in a way that these aspects interact with each other, being both a cause and an effect, and balance each other. The content of what we give them should be absolutely spiritual; however, in teaching, we should adopt the way of instruction. Our time of leading the young people should be educational with two-thirds of the time being like a teaching meeting of the church. Our teaching and speaking depend on the Spirit, but when we teach and speak, our words must be logical and follow a line of thought. Both logic and a line of thought are needed in order to touch a person&rsquo;s rational mind; hence, our teaching must be educational. Nevertheless, our way of teaching should not be exactly like a worldly education, because worldly education has knowledge but no life. The messages we speak have a spiritual content, but this spiritual content must be imparted through material that is educational.</p>
<p>When we give a message, we must touch the parts of a person&rsquo;s soul, because people are moved and inspired through the soul. If we cannot speak a message in a clear way to a person&rsquo;s mind, he will not be touched. If we give a confusing message, we should not expect people to be touched in their spirit. Hence, when we give a message, we must enable people to understand in their minds even though we use our spirit. A good message will open a person&rsquo;s mind and enable him to understand, because the spoken word has been mingled with the spirit. A message should not only make a person clear in his mind but also touch his spirit through his mind because the word has been released from the spirit.</p>
<p>In order to give a good message, the speaker must have a sharp and clear mind. He should have a definite idea concerning the line of thought, the main points, and the word that should be spoken first. Then when he speaks, his words will enlighten people&rsquo;s thoughts and minds. A good message should also have the Spirit, because the Spirit imparts spiritual content through the speaking that is related to the line of thought. When a speaker speaks, his words should follow a line of thought to open people&rsquo;s mind so that they may understand. At the same time, the Spirit will touch the spirit of the hearers through these words, causing them to have a response in their spirit.</p>
<p>When we lead the saints to study the Bible or a spiritual topic, we must have an educational focus. We need to realize that the young people are currently receiving an education; therefore, they have a predisposition to receive instructions. The schools they attend, from elementary schools to college universities, are all educational in nature. If our speaking in the young people&rsquo;s meeting does not fit with their educational experience or is not educational in nature, they will feel that the content is outdated. Hence, we should not ignore their educational disposition when we seek to impart spiritual knowledge and life into them. We can compare this situation to moving forward on railroad tracks that have been laid. We need to move forward on the tracks; we do not need to find another way.</p>
<p>Young people receive an education in a progressive way. Consequently, they should not come to a meeting merely to listen to a message on randomly chosen topics. Rather, they should go through a definite learning process. For example, young people attend junior high school for three years, high school for three years, and college for four years; there is a continual and definite progression in their learning. Similarly, our leading should progress over the course of several years, and we should speak to them in ways that correspond to their academic level. It would be ideal if we could teach them progressively and enable them to reach new levels of understanding each year. When a young person graduates from junior high school, he should also be led from a &ldquo;junior high&rdquo; understanding of matters related to spiritual knowledge and spiritual life to a &ldquo;high school&rdquo; level. He should similarly progress from a &ldquo;high school&rdquo; level to a &ldquo;college&rdquo; level when he graduates from high school.</p>
<p>Many of the families in the church in Taipei have children who are in the sixth grade. When these children begin junior high school, we should have a course of spiritual education for them. When they begin high school, we should have another set of spiritual material for them, and when they are in college, they should receive four years of advanced spiritual education. If our young saints receive a spiritual education in this way, we will see great results in ten years. This is not too difficult.</p><h2 class="head1">USING MODERN INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS</h2>
<p>Based on the disposition of young people to receive an education, we should use our spiritual materials effectively and teach them according to modern, instructional methods. In both the East and the West, educational systems utilize modern instructional methods, and we should do the same. While the material should be absolutely spiritual, the method of instruction should be modern.</p>
<p>For example, proficiency in mathematics requires a system of instruction. If an educator wants to teach the next generation a proper understanding of mathematics, he must consider the entire educational system; that is, he must consider what should be taught in elementary school, in junior high, in high school, in college, and even in graduate school. In this way he will be able to pass on mankind&rsquo;s accumulated knowledge of mathematics to the young ones of the next generation. This is true in regard to any field of knowledge, and this is the practice in modern educational systems.</p>
<p>We should adopt this way of instruction in regard to the spiritual material that we present to the young people, approaching it from the aspect of spiritual knowledge and of spiritual life. I hope that some brothers or sisters will work on compiling materials on knowledge and life. They also should consider the appropriate content for a young person in junior high, high school, or college. There should be a definite progression in the material. From the start of junior high to their graduation from college, we should use these ten years to infuse the content of our spiritual material into the next generation. I do not have the time to prepare such material. I can only present this to you in order to see if something can be worked out.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING MATERIAL FLEXIBLY</h2>
<p>Our young people&rsquo;s meetings need to address our lack of leading that is appropriate to various age groups. The leading for each age group should be different. Junior high students should be led in a way that is suitable to the junior high level, and high school and college students also should be led in their respective ways. Therefore, in our preparation of material for these respective age groups, we should be flexible. For example, an elementary student will learn a basic outline of history, but in junior high school, high school, and college, more historical details are added to their studies. Concerning the topic of the divinity of the Lord Jesus, junior high students may need only two verses from the Bible, while high school students can be given more verses. College students have the ability to consider this topic as it is presented throughout the entire Scriptures. Although the topic may be the same, the depth of the material should increase as the age of a young person increases. This is the principle of using material flexibly.</p>
<p>We should follow this principle when we cover material related to spiritual life. When we teach the junior high students to know the flesh, we should use material that is easy and simple. However, we should use deeper material with the brothers and sisters who are in college. Although we may be speaking about the same topic of knowing the flesh, the material that we use with each group should vary in weight, depth, and quantity. We should use material flexibly.</p>
<p>Even though we know that we need to use modern instructional methods, it is still difficult to have proper material. We should consider the progression of the topics to cover. The skills required to prepare this material is a major issue as well. It would be very good if some saints received a burden to compile this material, because there is indeed such a need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS AND DIRECTION OF THE MATERIAL</h2>
<p>The young people&rsquo;s meeting can stress matters related to spiritual knowledge one week and to spiritual life the next. It does not matter which aspect is covered first. Nevertheless, the material must be given in the way of education, and the person who speaks must also exercise his spirit. Young people need to receive material in the way of education, and in order to understand the material, there should also be exercises. This is the new way of education. Our exercises must be more serious than those in the schools. The young people meet once a week, and our time with them is precious. Hence, we should teach them seriously. We do not need to teach them many things at once, but what we teach should be thorough.</p>
<p>Concerning instruction in matters related to spiritual knowledge, it is profitable for junior high students to read the books in the Bible sequentially. However, it is more profitable to lead them to study the Bible according to topics. Spiritual knowledge can be divided into four major topics: Christ, redemption, life, and the church. The entire Bible is focused on these four points. All the verses in the Bible can be classified according to these four topics. These four topics can also be linked by one sentence: Christ came to accomplish redemption so that man may have life for the producing of the church. All our instruction related to spiritual knowledge should convey these four points. We can even use these four points to compile a curriculum for junior high, high school, and college students, leading them to know Christ, redemption, life, and the church.</p>
<p>Regarding our leading of the young people in matters related to spiritual life, we can speak according to the four stages of spiritual life. The first stage is the salvation stage&mdash;our being in Christ. The second stage is the revival stage&mdash;our abiding in Christ. The third stage is the stage of the cross&mdash;Christ living in us. The fourth stage is the stage of spiritual warfare&mdash;Christ being fully grown in us (see <em>The Experience of Life</em>). This is a brief sketch. The important points in life are very fine, but we cannot speak of them in detail now.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">TEACHING SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE&mdash;<br />
THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: March 10, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TEN POINTS CONCERNING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The first item to teach the young people related to spiritual knowledge is Christ. Concerning Christ, we need to pay attention to ten points: His divinity, His relation to all things, His incarnation (including His humanity), His crucifixion, His resurrection from the dead, His becoming the life-giving Spirit, His ascension, His giving of the Holy Spirit, His second coming and the establishment of the kingdom, and His centrality in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IMPORTANT VERSES CONCERNING<br />
THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will look at some important verses concerning the divinity of Christ. Christ exists from eternity past. His nature is eternal and divine. We cannot separate Christ&rsquo;s divinity from His eternal being. We must help the young people to see that our Savior is the unique God, who is without beginning and without end and who is self-existing and eternally existing.</p>
<p>There are several important verses that speak of His eternal, divine nature which we can use as material, but we must be flexible in our use of them. Of these verses, most are appropriate for junior high students. A few more of them can be added for high school students, and all the verses can be used with college students. This is a big topic that will require more than one meeting to cover.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;His Goings Forth Are from Ancient Times, /<br />
From the Days of Eternity&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel; / And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; This verse is quoted in Matthew 2:5-6 to prove that Christ as the Savior, the Ruler, would be born in Bethlehem of Judea. When Micah 5:2 says that Christ would be born in Bethlehem, it is referring to His birth in time and space. However, the last part of the verse says, &ldquo;His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; Hence, although our Savior was born in time and space, He exists from ancient times and from the days of eternity. <em>Ancient times</em> and <em>days of eternity</em> denote eternity past, before time even existed. These words are equal to the phrase <em>in the beginning</em> in John 1:1, which is different from the phrase <em>in the beginning</em> in Genesis 1:1. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; but Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; <em>In the beginning</em> in John refers to the eternal existence of the Lord Jesus, which is from eternity past, without a beginning. <em>In the beginning</em> in Genesis refers to the creation of the universe, which occurred at the beginning of time. This explanation has levels of complexity that need to be considered when speaking to junior high, high school, and college students.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;In the Beginning Was the Word&rdquo;</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; These verses show that the Word who was in the beginning, who was God, and who became flesh and tabernacled among us is Christ. The Christ who was in the beginning was not only God but also the Word. This Word is God spoken, God expressed. <em>Word</em> indicates that God, who was in the beginning, would be expressed.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s words are rather philosophical. He was not a simple man. When he wrote this Gospel, John was dealing with philosophical problems that were current at that time. In particular, there were many issues being debated concerning the divinity of the Lord Jesus. John wrote this book to deal with this particular problem. He began by saying that Christ is the Word, that is, God expressed. If Christ is God, God is the Word. This means that God can be expressed. As the Word, Christ is God expressed. This expressed God was in the beginning. Although His expression was not visible to others, He existed, and He desired to speak Himself forth, to express Himself more fully. In the beginning He was both God and the Word. God is His essence, and the Word is His expression. In essence He is God, whereas in expression He is the Word. This content, which is more philosophical in nature, is more appropriate for college students.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;A Son Is Given to Us...<br />
and His Name Will Be Called...Eternal Father&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us... / And His name will be called... / Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; Although He is the Son given to us, He is the Father. <em>Mighty God</em> is in contrast to <em>child.</em> Although He is the child born to us, He is the Mighty God. Hence, this verse speaks first of a child and Son and then of the Mighty God and Eternal Father. <em>Son</em> and <em>Eternal Father</em> are a pair, just as <em>child</em> and <em>Mighty God</em> are a pair. This truth is presented in the way of contrast, and when we point out this contrast, it is not too difficult for even a junior high school student to understand. This is a wonderful portion of the Bible that refers to the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was called the Son. John 3:36 says, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life.&rdquo; John 5:22 says, &ldquo;Neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son.&rdquo; Furthermore, 3:16 says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.&rdquo; From these verses we see that the Son given to us is the Lord Jesus; He is the only begotten Son given to us. Then in verse 36 John says, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life.&rdquo; Furthermore, according to 10:30, the Son and the Father are one. Hence, the Son given to us is called Eternal Father; He is the Father from ancient times (Micah 5:2). If we are speaking to students in junior high or high school, Isaiah 9:6 is sufficient. If we are speaking to college students, we can include the verses from the Gospel of John.</p><h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Your Years Are without End&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Psalm 102:24-27 says, &ldquo;My God,... / Your years are throughout all generations. / Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, / And the heavens are the work of Your hands. / They will perish, but You endure; / Indeed all of them will wear out like a garment; / Like clothing You will change them, / And they will be changed. / But You are the same, / And Your years are without end.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s years are without end, and He will never change. These verses are quoted in Hebrews 1:10-12, which say, &ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands; they will perish, but You remain perpetually; and they all will become old like a garment, and like a mantle You will roll them up; like a garment they will also be changed; but You are the same, and Your years will not fail.&rdquo; These verses, which refer to Christ, show two points. First, Christ existed before the heavens and the earth were created. He existed before the heavens and the earth came into being because He laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of His hands. This proves that He is without beginning. Second, even if the heavens and the earth perish, He would remain the same. This proves that He is without end. Hence, He is the eternal One.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;From Eternity to Eternity, You Are God&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Psalm 90:2 says, &ldquo;Before the mountains were brought forth, / And before You gave birth to the earth and the world, / Indeed from eternity to eternity, You are God.&rdquo; The first <em>eternity</em> refers to eternity past, and the second <em>eternity</em> refers to eternity future. From eternity past to eternity future Christ is God. Based on the quotation of Psalm 102:24-27, which speaks of God being eternal, and Hebrews 1:10-12, which refers to Christ, we know that <em>God</em> in Psalm 90:2 refers to Christ. Christ is God from eternity to eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;I Am Who I Am&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Exodus 3:14 says, &ldquo;God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And He said, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.&rdquo; The divine title <em>I AM</em> denotes that God is the One who is self-existing and ever-existing. <em>Self-existing</em> denotes that He is without beginning, and <em>ever-existing</em> denotes that He is without end. This is the equivalent of saying that He is from eternity to eternity. God said, &ldquo;I AM WHO I AM,&rdquo; indicating that He is God without beginning and without end and from eternity to eternity. This verse also is a reference to Christ, who is eternal in His divinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;I Am the Alpha and the Omega&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Revelation 1:8 says, &ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.&rdquo; Alpha is the first of the twenty-four letters of the Greek alphabet, and omega is the last letter. This denotes that the Lord is the First and the Last. At the same time, He is also the Almighty, the One who is, who was, and who is coming. <em>Who was</em> refers to the past, <em>who is</em> refers to the present, and <em>who is coming</em> refers to the future. Christ is such a One; He is the Almighty, He who is from eternity past to eternity future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Having neither Beginning of Days<br />
nor End of Life&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Hebrews 7:3 says, &ldquo;Being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.&rdquo; This is a depiction of Christ as the eternal Son of God, who, having no genealogy in time, has neither beginning of days nor end of life.</p>
<p>The first seven references mentioned above can be used all or in part with students in junior high and high school, but the last reference is entirely for college students. We should lead the young people to memorize these verses, but the younger ones can memorize important phrases in the verses rather than memorizing the whole verse or the whole section. In this way they will have a basic understanding of the divinity of Christ and the eternal nature of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING IN SPIRITUAL LIFE&mdash;<br />
GOD&rsquo;S CREATION AND GOD BEING LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: March 10, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TEACHING IN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DEPTH ACCORDING TO AGE</h2>
<p>In leading the young people we should follow a line related to spiritual knowledge and a line related to spiritual life. Both of these lines are important. Although we cannot take care of both lines in every meeting simultaneously, we can cover them alternately, focusing on spiritual knowledge one week and on spiritual life the next week. Since the young people are at various levels of human growth, our leading should vary as well. We can speak something simple to junior high students, something deeper to high school students, and something still deeper to college students. When we apply this principle, we need to be flexible and avoid making hard and fast rules. We should determine the level of depth according to the actual situation.</p>
<p>In leading the young people, we should avoid the way of giving a message; rather, we should give a main point and several verses. When we come to something that they do not understand, we should stop and speak again, and we should ask them to write down the main point and study what they have learned when they go home. The next time we meet, we should ask them to repeat the points by speaking in a way of testing. Although they may think that this is too difficult, it will be profitable to them. In every meeting we should use the first half for testing and the second half for a new lesson. This will give them a deep impression of the truth, and the content of the truth will be deeply rooted in them. Whenever someone is being tested, everyone will receive help. This is the best way to train the mind of the young ones and to help them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STIRRING UP PEOPLE&rsquo;S INTEREST<br />
WITH AN OPENING WORD OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>When we speak to the young people concerning the matter of life, we should say something that will stir up their interest, but it does not have to be too long. For example, we can say, &ldquo;Life gives meaning to the entire universe, and life makes the universe interesting. Just imagine if all the organisms in the universe were removed, the universe would have no meaning and would be void of anything of interest. The universe is interesting because of life, and life causes people to have a sense of wonder and meaning. If there were no plant life or animal life, the universe would be desolate and entirely void of meaning. Hence, life is the central focus of God&rsquo;s creation. In the universe life is the central thought and concept. In a garden there are flowers, grass, and trees, including fruit trees, all of which are full of the beauty of life. Without life, a garden would be a boring and desolate place.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE BIBLE AS A BOOK OF LIFE</h2>
<p>After we cover the matter of creation, we can speak about the Bible. The Bible is a book on life. There are billions of books in the world, but only the Bible is crucially focused on life. If we removed life from the Bible, it would be the same as removing life from the universe. Without life, the universe is desolate, boring, and meaningless; likewise, without life, the Bible is empty. The Bible speaks of the tree of life at the beginning (Gen. 2:9), and it speaks of the tree of life at the end (Rev. 22:2). Moreover, there is a river of water of life flowing at both the beginning and the end of the Bible (Gen. 2:10; Rev. 22:1). This shows that the focus of the Bible is on life. Life is mentioned repeatedly in the New Testament. For example, the Gospel of John is filled with the matter of life. In the Old Testament Psalms also mentions life (36:9). The Bible is a book on life, and all the knowledge in it is for the purpose of imparting life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Creation Taking Life as Its Goal</h2>
<p>We should present the matter of creation according to the first two chapters of Genesis. There is an innumerable variety of things in the universe, but even if there were a record of every item in the Bible, it would not exhaustively explain the work of God&rsquo;s creation. Nevertheless, God uses only two chapters in the Bible to record the items of His creation, because His emphasis is on life. Genesis 1:1-4 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. But the earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.&rdquo; For the earth to become waste and emptiness and for darkness to be on the surface of the deep indicate a situation of death, which is in contrast to life. When there was no life, darkness was on the surface of the deep. Therefore, God said, &ldquo;Let there be light&rdquo; (v. 3). When light came in, there was a separation from the darkness. Then God said, &ldquo;Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters&rdquo; (v. 6). God created the expanse and separated the waters under the expanse from the waters above the expanse (v. 7). When the waters were separated, an expanse was produced. Then God said, &ldquo;Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear&rdquo; (v. 9). &ldquo;God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good&rdquo; (v. 10). This step caused the waters to gather together, and it separated the waters from the land. There was a separation of light from darkness, a separation of what is above from what is below, and a separation of the waters from the land because God desired to create an environment for life to grow. After these steps, the earth produced grass and all kinds of plants (vv. 11-12), and one by one different kinds of life appeared (vv. 20-25). This shows that life is the goal of God&rsquo;s creation.</p><h2 class="head2">Creating Life from the Lower Forms<br />
to Higher Forms</h2>
<p>God first created the lower forms of life and then the higher forms. His creation began with plant life, which is the lowest form of life. Then He created the animal life and then man&rsquo;s life, which is the highest form of life. Plant life has no consciousness. Of the created forms of life with consciousness, God began with organisms that have the lowest form of consciousness, that is, the animals in the water. Then He created the animals in the air and the animals on the ground (1:11, 21, 25). In principle, animals on the ground have a higher degree of consciousness than those in the air. Following the creation of the animals on the ground, God created man (vv. 26-27). Man has the highest form of consciousness and sense among all of God&rsquo;s creation, whether in the sphere of water, air, or land. Among all the created organisms, except for angels, man&rsquo;s consciousness and senses are the highest. Nevertheless, Genesis 2 shows that God was not satisfied that man would have only the created life; He wanted man to receive the uncreated divine life, the highest life in the universe, which is God&rsquo;s life. Hence, after creating man, God placed him before the tree of life so that man would receive this life (v. 9). From this we can see that life is the content and the goal in God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>We must tell the young people that God is life. In the Bible there are many verses that speak of God being life. Psalm 36:9 says that God is the fountain of life. The Gospel of John begins by saying, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1), but then it says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (v. 4). In 10:10 the Lord said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&rdquo; Colossians 3 says, &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo; (v. 4). First John 5:11-12 says, &ldquo;God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; In chapter 22 of Revelation, which is the last book of the Bible, the tree of life and the river of water of life are mentioned again (vv. 1-2). All these verses show that God emphasizes life, that God Himself is life, and that God desires to give us eternal life.</p>
<p>The matter of God being life requires a change in our natural concept, because the first thought of most people about God is not related to life. The first thought of both Christians and non-Christians concerning God is not related to God being life. Some think of God as being the sovereign One, others of God as the Creator, and still others as the almighty One, but rarely do they think of God as life. Even theologians do not place much emphasis on the matter of God being life. Most tell people that God is mighty, holy, compassionate, righteous, and so forth. Rarely in Christianity is there a message emphasizing that God is life. Nevertheless, the Bible reveals that God is life. According to the record in the Bible, after God created man, the first thing that He did was to place man in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden (Gen. 2:8-9). The first impression God gave to man of Himself was not related to power, holiness, love, or righteousness but to life.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2, after God created man, He did not speak to man of His power or His love; rather, He placed man in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden. This shows that God is life to man. When I saw this, I had a great inward turn. Formerly, I thought of God as a great God, but on that day I became clear that God is life to us. Even though He is great, He became a tree of life with fruit for us to eat. In the New Testament many people viewed the Lord Jesus as a person of great power because He performed many miracles, such as changing water to wine and even raising people from the dead. However, the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life&rdquo; (John 6:35), and He likened Himself to the children&rsquo;s bread (Matt. 15:26). This reveals that God is life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Flowing Out to Be Man&rsquo;s Life</h2>
<p>God is not only life, but He also longs to be our life. However, in order to be our life, He had to come forth to be our life and to be gained by us. The Bible shows that the coming forth of God is a matter of flowing. The first step in His flowing out was in the Lord Jesus. The second step of His flowing out is as the life-giving Spirit. The flowing out of God in the Lord Jesus may not be obvious to us. However, we can clearly see that the Spirit is the flowing out of God. In the Old Testament, when Moses struck the rock, living water flowed out of the rock. The flowing out of the living water is a type of the Spirit (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). John 7:38-39 also says that rivers of living water will flow out of the innermost being of those who believe into the Lord and that the Spirit is this living water. Hence, the Spirit is the flowing out of God, the ultimate means of God flowing into man.</p>
<p>God became flesh in the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, and then He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection (1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b). His &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; in these two steps was for the purpose of flowing out in order to be received into us. This is seen at the conclusion of the Bible. Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits.&rdquo; Both the living water that flows out of the throne and the tree of life are God, because the tree of life is the Lord Jesus and the water of life is the Spirit. The picture at the end of Revelation shows that God is flowing out to be our life. He is the tree of life full of fruits for us to eat; He is also the gushing water of life for us to drink. Because He is flowing out, we can take Him into us to be our life.</p>
<p>If the Lord Jesus had not become the life-giving Spirit, it would not be possible for us to receive Him. After becoming flesh and then becoming the life-giving Spirit, God is available to be received by us.</p><h2 class="head2">God Creating a Spirit for Man</h2>
<p>In order for God to be life to us, He cannot be outside of us; rather, He has to enter into man. In order for us to receive anything into us, there is the need for a receiving organ. For example, in order to receive food into our physical body, we need a stomach; to hear sound, we must have ears; and to see colors, we must have eyes. If we want to receive something, we must have an appropriate organ in order to receive it. Consequently, man needs a receiving organ in order to receive God. Therefore, God created man with a human spirit. Of all the living creatures, only man has a spirit, although angels, who are also created, are spirits (Heb. 1:14). When the Lord Jesus spoke of being the bread of life to eat and the living water to drink, He was not speaking of food that is received by our stomach, the food that perishes (John 6:27), but of Himself as spiritual food to be received in our human spirit (v. 63). In our spirit we can receive God as our spiritual bread and our spiritual water.</p>
<p>God created man with a spirit so that He could be received by man. Genesis 2:7 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.&rdquo; God used dust to form man&rsquo;s body and then breathed the breath of life into man&rsquo;s nostrils. This breath is not the same as God&rsquo;s Spirit. However, when this breath entered into man, it became man&rsquo;s spirit. In verse 7 the word <em>breath</em> is the same word in the original language as <em>spirit</em> in Proverbs 20:27. As a result of God&rsquo;s breathing, man became a living soul. Man has three parts: a physical body made from dust, a spirit formed by the breath that was breathed into him, and a soul that was produced when God&rsquo;s breath was breathed into him. The soul is deeper than the body, but it is not as deep as the human spirit.</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:23 confirms that man has three parts, saying, &ldquo;May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete.&rdquo; This verse clearly states that man has three parts: spirit, soul, and body. Hebrews 4:12 proves that the spirit is distinct from the soul, because it speaks of the living word of God that is piercing &ldquo;even to the dividing of soul and spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Spirit Being for Contacting God</h2>
<p>God created a spirit for man so that man could receive Him, because He is Spirit. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; Man&rsquo;s spirit is for man to contact God. If we consider this matter more deeply, we can add two more verses. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; The fact that the Spirit can witness with our spirit proves that the purpose of our spirit is to receive God as Spirit and that God can come into our spirit because He is Spirit. Thus, the Holy Spirit can witness in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We can be joined to the Lord as one spirit because we have received Him as the Spirit in our spirit; thus, the Spirit and our spirit are one spirit. These two verses are quite deep, and we must consider whether we should present them to high school students or only to college students.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing Man&rsquo;s Spirit</h2>
<p>Besides the crucial points above, we must help the young saints to know their human spirit. Our conscience is a part of our human spirit, and the function of our conscience proves that we have a spirit. Despite the fact that a decision makes sense according to our intellect and reasoning, we still may have an uneasy sense in the depth of our being. This is because our reasoning capacity, which is related to our soul, is not as deep as the function of the conscience in our spirit. Although we may make a decision according to our intellect, there often is a sense in the depth of our being that causes us to have a sense of unease related to a decision that is based merely on our intellect. This sense is the response of our conscience. The most obvious example is stealing something from another person. Even though stealing may bring some sense of pleasure to our soul, there is an accusation, a condemnation, and even a fear in the depths of our being. These sensations come from the operation of our conscience in our spirit. In addition to our soul, there is a deeper part of our being that is our spirit, and this deeper part is manifested to us through the operation of our conscience in our spirit. Many times our intellect and emotions are in agreement to do a certain thing, but our conscience protests and condemns the inclination of our intellect and emotion. This proves that our spirit and our soul are different and that our spirit is deeper than our soul.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing Man as God&rsquo;s Vessel</h2>
<p>We can also speak to high school or college students about man being a vessel created by God. Romans 9:21-23 says, &ldquo;Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor? And what if God, wishing to demonstrate His wrath and make His power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, in order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory.&rdquo; This shows that God-created human beings are vessels. The purpose of a vessel is to contain something. God created man as a vessel to contain Himself.</p>
<p>Many people think that God created man as an instrument to be used by Him. This is not accurate. God created man as a vessel, and He wants to put Himself into this vessel so that He can be expressed. God does not want us to be an instrument. Second Corinthians 4:7 says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.&rdquo; When we were saved, God entered into us; thus, we have a treasure in us, the earthen vessels. Our main function in this universe, or we may say our only function, is to be God&rsquo;s vessel. Just as a light bulb is a vessel designed to contain and express electricity, we are vessels designed to contain and express God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">TEACHING SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE&mdash;<br />
CHRIST AND ALL THINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: March 16, 1961</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the matter of the relationship between Christ and all things. There are twelve points related to this truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST CREATING ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>First, Christ created all things. When we speak to the young people concerning the relationship between Christ and all things, we should begin with the matter of Christ&rsquo;s creating all things and explain that to create means to bring something into existence out of nothing.</p>
<p>In the Bible the word <em>create</em> means to produce something out of nothing, to call things not being as being. In Romans 4:17 God is identified as the One who &ldquo;calls the things not being as being&rdquo; and who &ldquo;gives life to the dead.&rdquo; God has two creations in the universe&mdash;the old creation and the new creation. The old creation came into existence through God&rsquo;s calling things not being as being, whereas the new creation came into being through death and resurrection. The old creation came into existence out of nothing, but the new creation was produced by God giving life to the redeemed believers in the old creation, who were damaged by death. Hence, God is a God who calls things not being as being and who gives life to the dead. We, the saved ones, are God&rsquo;s new creation in Christ.</p>
<p>There are several verses concerning Christ&rsquo;s creating all things. John 1:3 says, &ldquo;All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.&rdquo; When we serve the young people, the most important matter is to plant into them the concept that all things and all matters come into being through Christ. Everything that has come into being came into being through Him.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 8:6 says, &ldquo;One Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through Him.&rdquo; Christ is the Lord, and through Him are all things. Colossians 1:16 says, &ldquo;All things have been created through Him.&rdquo; Hebrews 1:2 says, &ldquo;Through whom also He made the universe.&rdquo; To the young people who are relatively young in life, it is sufficient to give them two of these four verses. Those who are deeper in life, however, can be given all four verses.</p>
<p>If it is possible, we can also speak a word of correction and rebuttal concerning the theory of evolution to the young ones. Even though many scientific studies in recent years have shown that some parts of the evolution theory are not correct, many young ones may have been poisoned by it. We should mention a few points in a brief way, but there is no need to mention much else. First, the theory of evolution offers no explanation for the source from which all things evolve. Even if organisms evolve, they cannot evolve out of nothing. There has to be a beginning, a source, a point of origin. We cannot ignore the fact that there is a source. For example, a chair comes from wood, wood comes from trees, and trees come from seeds. However, where do the seeds of the tree come from? People have no answers to questions related to the origin of the source itself. Even scientists are unable to say how all things came into being. Only the Bible tells us that God created all things. In order for the theory of evolution to stand, it must account for creation. However, when we trace everything back to its beginning, there is nothing from which things could have evolved. The only explanation comes from the Bible, which is that God created all things by calling not being as being. It is also wrong to associate evolution with the mere phenomenon of change. For example, an egg undergoes a change when it is hatched and a chicken is produced, but this is not evolution. Similarly, a tree will gradually grow and bear fruit, which, in turn, will ripen gradually. The fact that living organisms change does not prove evolution or negate the revelation in the Bible that God is the Creator of all things. Even things that change have their source in God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must tell the young people that God established a law in His creation that stipulates that every organism is according to its own kind (Gen. 1:11-12, 21, 24-25). Living things cannot evolve from one species to another species. Fish are fish; they cannot evolve to become birds, and neither can birds evolve to become horses. This is a law that God established when He created all things. A horse and a donkey cannot evolve into a mule that can reproduce other mules because their different natures prevent this. Although a donkey and a horse can produce a mule, the mule that is produced is infertile and cannot procreate.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE ORIGIN OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Second, Christ is the origin of all things. Concerning the matter of origin, we should share some common knowledge concerning the universe. From all the theorems and laws in the universe, scientists and physicists know that the universe has only one source, not many sources. The laws and theorems discovered by the astronomers, geologists, and physicists prove that the universe came from a single source. We also know that the universe came out of a single source because it is very orderly and not chaotic. This is something that cannot be overturned. The more people study physics and other natural laws, the more they discover that the entire universe is one unified system. Under this system, there are numerous sub-systems, but none of them is in conflict with the others. If several people work on something together but are not of one mind, they will not produce something that is unified. However, the universe is a single unified system. This shows that the whole universe was created by our one God. Our Lord, the Creator, is the unique origin of the universe. We do not have two or more origins because there is only one Lord, one source.</p>
<p>Concerning this point, we should show the young people several verses. Romans 11:36 says, &ldquo;Because out from Him... are all things.&rdquo; <em>Out from</em> implies origin. This verse refers to God. However, God is Christ, and Christ is God Himself (John 14:7-11). To say that God is the origin of all things is to say that Christ is the origin of all things. Out from Him are all things, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being (1:3). All things come out from Him; He is the origin of all things.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 8:6 says, &ldquo;Out from whom are all things.&rdquo; This refers to God the Father; however, we know that Christ and the Father are one (John 10:30). Hence, to say that the Father is the source of all things is to say that Christ is the source of all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE LORD OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Third, Christ is the Lord of all things. Since all things were created by Him and He is the origin of all things, He is the Lord of all things, the Sovereign over all things.</p>
<p>In Acts 10:36 Peter spoke to the household of Cornelius, telling them that Jesus Christ is Lord of all; that is, He is Lord of all persons and things. We should tell the young people that in the whole universe there is no other Lord besides our Lord Jesus Christ. Only Christianity identifies the One whom it follows as Lord. Buddhism does not say that Sakyamuni is Lord, only that he is Buddha. Islam does not say that Muhammad is Lord. Neither Confucius (Confucianism) nor Lao-tzu (Taoism) claimed that its leader is the Lord. It is remarkable that only the Bible says that Jesus is Lord. This is because He is indeed Lord of all. He is the Lord of all people and all things; besides Him there is no other Lord in the universe. As the Lord of all, He is the Lord of heaven and earth, the Lord of animals and plants, and the Lord of seas and oceans. He is your Lord, and He is also my Lord. Christ is the Lord of all things. All things were created by Him and came out of Him; hence, all things belong to Him. He is the Lord of all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE HEAD OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Fourth, Christ is the Head of all things. Ephesians 1:22 says that Christ is the Head over all things. The Lord Jesus is not only the Lord of all things but also the Head over all things. All things take Him as their Head and as their end. Nothing is higher than Him, before Him, or above Him. He is the topmost and foremost One; He is the Head over all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING BEFORE ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Fifth, Colossians 1:17 says, &ldquo;He is before all things.&rdquo; Christ is before all things. <em>Before all things</em> emphasizes the aspect of time. As far as time is concerned, He is before all things. Before all things came into being, He existed. All the young people should be able to recite this verse.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING ABOVE ALL</h2>
<p>Sixth, Christ is above all. This point emphasizes the aspect of space. In space Christ is above all; in time Christ is before all. John 3:31 twice speaks of Christ being &ldquo;above all,&rdquo; and Romans 9:5 says that He is &ldquo;over all.&rdquo; In the Greek language the two phrases denote different things. John 3:31 emphasizes position. According to position, Christ is above all. Romans 9:5 emphasizes administration. According to administration, Christ is over all. Christ administrates from above. This shows that Christ being above all is related to His governance of all things, not merely to occupying the highest place in space. John 3:31 shows that the Lord Jesus, the One who is in the highest heaven and who is above all, came to the earth, whereas Romans 9:5 emphasizes that He is the One who administrates over all because He is above all.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST FILLING ALL IN ALL</h2>
<p>Seventh, Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is &ldquo;the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; Christ fills all in all in order to be the content of all things and to be in all things. The point of Christ&rsquo;s filling all in all is not easy to understand, and it is also very difficult to explain thoroughly. However, we can mention a few points.</p>
<p>The first point is that even if we cannot fully understand all the spiritual things in the universe, we should believe what is spoken of in God&rsquo;s Word. For example, the Word speaks of God and of God being Spirit (John 4:24). Although God is invisible, we cannot deny His existence simply because we cannot see Him. Christians know that God is invisible and that the Spirit is intangible, but we also know that God exists. Although the Bible reveals that God created us in order to be related to us, the Bible does not tell us everything that pertains to God. Hence, it is impossible for us to comprehend everything in the universe based on our limited understanding. Even if there are certain spiritual matters in the universe that we do not understand, we should believe and receive them according to the word in the Bible. Although we may not have a clear sense or understanding of the Lord filling all in all, we should not deny this truth, because it is revealed in the Bible. We may not understand today, but one day we will understand that all things in the universe have the element of Christ. Christ is in all things.</p>
<p>The second point is that the Bible tells us that all things are created by Christ, that all things exist through Christ, and that all things are upheld and borne by Him (Heb. 1:3). All these points are related to Christ filling all in all. Christ filling all in all means that He created all things, that He causes all things to exist, and that He upholds and bears all things.</p>
<p>The third point is that in the universe and in all things, there are forces, theories, laws, and phenomena, all of which are very profound and which even physicists with great intelligence cannot fully explain. Nevertheless, all these things symbolize Christ. The Bible says clearly that the Lord is our power (Phil. 4:13; 2 Tim. 1:7; 4:17) and that the Lord is our light (John 1:4; 8:12). The Bible also says that the Lord is our law, which can be illustrated by the law of the Spirit of life in Romans 8:2. However, it is not so easy to point out a theory or a phenomenon in the Bible. We can deduce from the Bible that, at the very least, these forces, theories, laws, and phenomena are symbols and depictions of Christ. Romans 1:20 says, &ldquo;The invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made.&rdquo; The eternal power of God is an aspect of the forces in the universe. Thus, these forces, theories, laws, and phenomena symbolize God and enable us to comprehend God in a limited way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we cannot fully understand how our Lord is the force in the universe. Perhaps in the coming glory we will understand how the Lord fills the forces, theories, laws, and phenomena in the universe. The Lord Jesus is the One who fills all and who is in all. Only when we enter into eternity will it even be possible for us to understand how Christ fills all in all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THINGS COHERING IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Eighth, all things cohere in Christ. Colossians 1:17 says, &ldquo;All things cohere in Him.&rdquo; All things exist because they cohere in Christ. For example, all the spokes on a wheel are held together by the hub. If we take away the hub, the spokes would fall apart. This is the meaning of the word <em>cohere.</em> All things cohere in Christ; hence, if Christ were removed, all things would collapse and disintegrate. In 1933 Brother Nee mentioned this verse in a conference, saying that all things are &ldquo;unified&rdquo; in Christ. The entire universe coheres in Christ; in Christ there is cohering power.</p>
<p>According to astronomical studies, there is indeed an indescribable holding power in the universe. If we removed this holding power, the universe would collapse. Colossians 1:17 indicates that Christ is the central force holding all things together in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST UPHOLDING AND BEARING ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Ninth, Christ upholds and bears all things. Hebrews 1:3 says that the Lord is &ldquo;upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power.&rdquo; While most people&rsquo;s understanding of this matter is limited, even a physicist or an astronomer cannot fully explain how all the stars and planets are upheld in the universe. All the galaxies in the universe have existed for billions of years, but scientists do not know why the universe exists or how it is held together. The Bible, however, clearly tells us that the Lord upholds and bears all things by the word of His power. Furthermore, Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;The universe has been framed by the word of God.&rdquo; In creation, God &ldquo;spoke, and it was; / He commanded, and it stood&rdquo; (Psa. 33:9). Not only was the universe created by the Lord&rsquo;s word, but the universe itself coheres because the Lord upholds and bears all things by the word of His power.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THINGS HAVING BEEN GIVEN TO CHRIST</h2>
<p>Tenth, all things have been given to Christ. John 3:35 and 13:3 speak of the Father giving all things into the hand of Christ. These verses may cause a person to ask, &ldquo;If all things were created by Christ, why is there a need to hand over all things to Him?&rdquo; This point requires some theological explanation. Although the Lord Jesus and God are one, as the Christ the Lord Jesus was also sent. The meaning of <em>Christ</em> is &ldquo;the anointed One,&rdquo; and in the Bible an anointed person is one who is commissioned and sent to accomplish a certain task. Christ was commissioned with the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s will; He was sent to accomplish God&rsquo;s plan in the universe, including the creation of all things according to God&rsquo;s intention. God planned to create, and Christ created all things. When the work of creation was completed, the Father gave these things to Christ. Hence, Christ was given all things from the Father&rsquo;s hand. Christ&rsquo;s inheritance of all things is a matter of righteousness; He does not take anything by force. Hence, John 13:3 says, &ldquo;The Father had given all into His hands.&rdquo; The Father, as the source, gives all things to Christ, the Son.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE HEIR OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Eleventh, Christ is the Heir of all things (Heb. 1:2). All things were created by Christ and are being upheld and borne by Him. God has given all things to Christ. Hence, Christ is the Heir of all things; all things are for Him. Colossians 1:16 says, &ldquo;All things have been created...unto Him.&rdquo; The word <em>unto</em> in this verse and the word <em>to</em> in Romans 11:36 are the same in Greek, meaning that all things are given to Him as an inheritance. Hence, Christ is Heir of all things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THINGS BEING HEADED UP IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>Lastly, all things will be headed up in Christ. Ephesians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; We need to consider the meaning of <em>head up,</em> which is related to the thought of gathering together. For example, forty people may be apart from one another even though they are each tied to a rope. If I gather all the people together by drawing all the ropes to me, they will be gathered to me and headed up by me. Similarly, when a person goes to the market to buy fish, he uses a rope to tie the fish together. When he picks up the rope, the fish are collected together by the rope. These are illustrations of the meaning of heading up in Greek. At the fullness of the times, God will head up all things in Christ.</p>
<p>All things were created by Christ, Christ is the Lord of all things, and all things have been given to Christ. Eventually, all things will be gathered together in Christ as the One who is the Head of all things. These twelve points concerning Christ and all things should be conveyed to the young people according to their level of understanding. The serving ones should consider and decide how to present these matters.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING IN SPIRITUAL LIFE&mdash;<br />
MAN&rsquo;S FALL AND MAN&rsquo;S REGENERATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: March 23, 1961</h1>
<p>In chapter 3 we spoke of spiritual life as it relates to God&rsquo;s creation and to God being life. Now we will consider man&rsquo;s fall and man&rsquo;s regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S FALL</h2>
<p>There is a great deal of speaking in Christianity concerning God but very little speaking concerning God being life. There is also much speaking about God&rsquo;s creation of man but very little speaking about God creating a spirit in man so that man could receive God&rsquo;s life. Similarly, Christianity speaks concerning man&rsquo;s fall, but it rarely refers to the fact that the human spirit was damaged by man&rsquo;s fall. Most Christian teachers stress that man&rsquo;s fall resulted in his judicial condemnation by God. Those with a deeper understanding teach that man not only commits sins worthy of condemnation but also has a sinful nature as a result of the fall. Nevertheless, it is rarely pointed out that the fall damaged man&rsquo;s God-created human spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Spirit Being Damaged and<br />
Losing Its Function</h2>
<p>When we speak to the young people about man&rsquo;s fall, we must present three points. First, man sinned, and this sinful act condemned him before God as if he were in a court of law. Second, man&rsquo;s fall caused man to have a corrupt nature, to have sin within him. Hence, man not only commits sinful acts outwardly but also has a sinful nature inwardly. Because man has a sinful nature, his human nature is contaminated by sin. Third, from the viewpoint of life, man&rsquo;s fall resulted in his spirit being damaged. When Satan tempted man and caused man to fall, Satan damaged man&rsquo;s spirit, which was originally created as a vessel for man to contact and receive God. Although a light bulb can receive electricity and shine forth light if its outward surface is dirty, it will be unable to shine forth light if its inner fuse is damaged. Satan damaged the part within man that enabled man to contact God and receive God&mdash;the human spirit. Once man&rsquo;s spirit was damaged, man was truly fallen.</p>
<p>The proof that man&rsquo;s spirit was damaged in the fall can be seen in God&rsquo;s word to Adam in Genesis 2:17. God said, &ldquo;Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo; Physically speaking, however, Adam did not die on the day that he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Although he did not die physically, his spirit died. Consider the example of the light bulb. From the outward appearance, it is often not possible to know if a light bulb is good or bad, especially if the light switch is turned off. Outwardly, a light bulb can appear to be intact, but if its fuse is broken, it will not conduct electricity. When Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his spirit was deadened even though he was outwardly alive. His spirit was deadened because it lost its function.</p>
<p>The function of the spirit is to contact God. Since the function of our eyes is to see and the function of our ears is to hear, we can say that those who are blind or deaf have lost the function of their eyes and ears. Hence, their eyes and ears have been deadened. After Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his spirit was deadened. Although his body was still alive, his spirit was deadened within because he lost the ability to contact God. To God, it was as if Adam were dead, because the function of his spirit was damaged.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:1 says, &ldquo;You, though dead in your offenses and sins.&rdquo; <em>Dead</em> refers to the deadness of the human spirit, because Paul was addressing believers who were living. When he said that they were dead in offenses and sins, he meant that their spirit had been deadened by their sins. When a person drowns, we say that he died in water. To say that people are dead in offenses and sins is equivalent to saying that people are damaged in their spirit because of their sins. We were dead in our sins because our spirit was damaged by our sins. Colossians 2:13 says, &ldquo;You, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh.&rdquo; This means that our offenses and our flesh caused our spirit to lose its function; that is, our spirit was deadened because of our offenses and our flesh.</p>
<p>Matthew 8:22 says, &ldquo;Let the dead bury their own dead.&rdquo; The first reference to <em>dead</em> speaks of those who are alive physically but dead in spirit, and the second reference to <em>dead</em> speaks of those who are physically dead. Thus, for the dead to bury their own dead means that those who are physically alive but dead in the spirit should bury those who are physically dead.</p>
<p>All these verses speak of people who are spiritually dead, not physically dead. When Satan tempted man to sin, his purpose was to damage the spirit that God had created in man. God created the human spirit so that man could contact Him and receive Him. When Satan damaged man&rsquo;s spirit, man could no longer contact God. Once man&rsquo;s spirit was damaged, man was in complete darkness. If someone wants to prevent us from seeing, the easiest way is to damage our eyes. Once our eyes are damaged, we will be in darkness and see nothing. The primary goal in Satan&rsquo;s corruption of man was to damage man&rsquo;s spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Results of Man&rsquo;s Spirit Being Damaged</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Man Being Alienated from God</h2>
<p>After man&rsquo;s spirit was damaged, it lost its function; as a result, man became alienated from God. Ephesians 4:18 says, &ldquo;Being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart.&rdquo; The Gentiles, being fallen, are darkened in their understanding and ignorant within; consequently, they are alienated from the life of God. Man is alienated from God and unable to receive God as life because he is darkened within and deadened in his spirit. Man&rsquo;s alienation from God is mainly related to his inability to receive God&rsquo;s life. God wants man to receive Him as life in order to contact and enjoy Him, but Satan damaged man&rsquo;s spirit, making it impossible for man to receive God as life. As a result, man is alienated from God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man Losing All Feeling</h2>
<p>A further result of man&rsquo;s fall is that man lost his inner feeling; that is, he lost the consciousness of his conscience. Ephesians 4:19 says, &ldquo;Who, being past feeling.&rdquo; <em>Being past feeling,</em> in the original Greek language, means to discard all feeling, indicating that a person has lost feeling in his conscience. With a deadened spirit and with his alienation from God, man lost all feeling related to his inner sense of God. We must tell the young people, seriously and emphatically, that people are corrupt because their deadened spirit and their alienation from God have caused them to lose all feeling within them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Giving Themselves Over to Lasciviousness<br />
to Work All Uncleanness in Greediness</h2>
<p>The third step of man&rsquo;s fall is that people &ldquo;have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness&rdquo; (v. 19). To give oneself over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness means to do all kinds of immoral things and to live one&rsquo;s life in lasciviousness and uncleanness. This is a matter related to life and to our living. Because of the fall, a person&rsquo;s spirit is deadened. This deadness issues in three things: alienation from the life of God, losing all feeling in his conscience, and a lascivious living that is full of immorality and uncleanness in greed. This is man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S REGENERATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Regeneration</h2>
<p>Now we will cover the matter of man&rsquo;s regeneration, which is related to our salvation. Even though man fell, he can be saved. Man&rsquo;s salvation is related to regeneration. The central meaning of salvation is regeneration. If a person is not regenerated, he has not been saved. A saved person has been regenerated. According to John 1:13, which says, &ldquo;Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God,&rdquo; regeneration means that man is born of God, that God enters into man to be his life. When God enters into man to be his life, He causes man to be born again. Every saved person has two births. His first birth is of his parents, whereas his second birth is of God. A saved person is born again of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man Being Regenerated in His Spirit</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, man is regenerated in a specific part of his being. In John 3:3 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Man needs to be born again in order to enter into God&rsquo;s kingdom. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; This indicates that man must be born of water and the Spirit in order to be born again. Hence, to be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit. God is Spirit (4:24). When God as the Spirit enters into man, man receives God as life and is born again. Then John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; This verse clearly shows that when the Holy Spirit enters into us, He enters into our spirit and causes our spirit to be born again, because &ldquo;that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; The first reference to <em>Spirit</em> in this verse is to the Holy Spirit, and the second reference to <em>spirit</em> is to our human spirit. Regeneration does not produce a person of flesh and blood but a person with an enlivened spirit. This verse also proves that God regenerates us in our spirit. God is Spirit, and He enters into our spirit to regenerate us.</p>
<p>According to Ezekiel 36:26, God said, &ldquo;I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you.&rdquo; God said that He would give us a new heart and put a new spirit within us. Without a doubt this refers to God&rsquo;s regeneration of our deadened spirit, which makes our spirit new. <em>New spirit</em> does not mean that God creates another spirit for us; rather, He renews our old spirit. God renews our old spirit by coming into our spirit as the Spirit of God thereby enlivening it. Once our spirit is enlivened, it becomes new; that is, our old spirit becomes a new spirit by being enlivened by the Spirit. In verse 26 God said, &ldquo;A new spirit I will put within you,&rdquo; and in verse 27 He said, &ldquo;I will put My Spirit within you.&rdquo; When we are regenerated, God&rsquo;s Spirit comes into us to renew our old spirit, making it new, and to enliven it, making it alive.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Spirit and God&rsquo;s Spirit<br />
Becoming One Spirit</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s Spirit indwells our spirit and mingles with our spirit to become one spirit. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; The witnessing of the Spirit with our spirit proves that the Holy Spirit is in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; The Lord is the Spirit, and when the Lord enters into our spirit and is joined with our spirit, the two spirits become one. These verses show that when God enters into us for our regeneration, the Spirit of God enters into our spirit. Through regeneration, our deadened spirit is made alive.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Function of Man&rsquo;s Spirit Being Recovered</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:5 says, &ldquo;Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ.&rdquo; Being made alive refers to being regenerated in our spirit. Colossians 2:13 says, &ldquo;You, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our offenses.&rdquo; Here, <em>being made alive</em> also refers to being regenerated in spirit. When we are regenerated, our human spirit is restored to its function. A spirit with a restored function is a spirit that has been made alive.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man Being Able to Fellowship with God</h2>
<p>Our spirit being made alive results in three things. First, we are able to fellowship with God. This is in contrast to being alienated from God. A regenerated person is able to fellowship with God. First John 1:1-3 speaks of the fellowship of life. A person who has the life of God can fellowship with God. God&rsquo;s life enables man to fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man Being Full of Feeling Inwardly</h2>
<p>Second, a person who has the life of God is full of inward feeling. This is in contrast to being past feeling as spoken of in Ephesians 4:19. First John 3:19-21 says, &ldquo;In this we will know that we are of the truth, and we will persuade our heart before Him...If our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God.&rdquo; The ability of our heart to be persuaded and to not blame us and the boldness that we have toward God are indications of the presence of feelings. Romans 8:6 also says, &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; This verse speaks of having inner feeling. When our mind is set on the spirit, we have an inward sense of life and peace.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man Being Able to Live Out<br />
All the Virtues of God</h2>
<p>Third, a person with an enlivened spirit is able to live out the virtues of God. This is in contrast to a lascivious living that is according to all uncleanness in greediness. First John 3:14 says, &ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers. He who does not love abides in death.&rdquo; Those who love the brothers have passed out of death into life, and those who do not love abide in death. The ability to love the brothers is proof that we have been enlivened inwardly. Romans 13:8 says, &ldquo;He who loves the other has fulfilled the law.&rdquo; Love is the underlying principle of all good deeds; love produces good deeds. The ability to live out love speaks of the ability to live out the virtues of God. Our ability to live out love proves that we have been enlivened in our spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT<br />
AND PRACTICING TO SPEAK<br />
FOR THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: March 31, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SPIRIT BEING LIVING AND RELEASED<br />
AND NOT WAITING FOR INSPIRATION</h2>
<p>When we lead the young people&rsquo;s meeting, our spirit should be living and released. The atmosphere in a meeting is crucial because it can either enliven or kill the saints. If we activate and exercise our spirit when we arrive at a meeting, the saints will be enlivened by the atmosphere of the meeting. Due to our background, however, many brothers and sisters are passive when they attend the bread-breaking meeting or the prayer meeting. Instead of exercising their spirit, they wait to be inspired by the Spirit. This is not a good situation. If we merely sit on chairs with Bibles and hymnals in our hands but do not exercise our spirit, it will be difficult to experience the flow of the Spirit.</p>
<p>If we do not stir up our spirit, the Spirit will not be able to move us. A car moves only when its engine has been ignited. If we do not &ldquo;ignite&rdquo; our spirit and, instead, wait for others to &ldquo;ignite&rdquo; it, the atmosphere of the meeting will not be living. Our meetings have suffered greatly in the past because this has been our practice. We need to break this pattern. Others always know when our spirit is not exercised. Without an exercised spirit, our spirit will be lethargic, and we will have an attitude of waiting for the Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration in the meeting. Furthermore, a lethargic spirit is not a serving spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE MEETING WITH OTHERS<br />
IN A SERVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We can illustrate this situation by considering a basketball game. When basketball players arrive at a game, they must be ready to play. If they come onto the court wearing long gowns instead of uniforms, they will not be prepared to play. Similarly, the meeting will be affected if we sit quietly and our spirit is not exercised through either praying or singing. However, if we exercise and release our spirit as soon as we arrive at a meeting and if all the saints bear the burden of the meeting by praying together in a blended way, the meeting will be full of power. If we are burdened, we will even arrive at a meeting five or ten minutes early and we will begin to pray with whomever is there. Consequently, the prayer will begin spontaneously with just two or three.</p>
<p>Coming together to meet is a service, so we must have a serving attitude. Just like a basketball player who is prepared to play, we must be prepared to &ldquo;play ball&rdquo; when we arrive at a meeting. We cannot merely be spectators. When we arrive at a meeting, we should not wait for others to function. Neither should we wait for the leading brothers to pray or call a hymn. Young saints who do not pray in a young people&rsquo;s meeting are like basketball players who do not play ball when they arrive at a game.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT AND FELLOWSHIPPING<br />
WITH THE LORD CONTINUALLY</h2>
<p>We cannot be spectators in the regular meetings of the church and then exercise our spirit when we are serving in the young people&rsquo;s meeting. This kind of service cannot receive much blessing, because we cannot fool God. The law of God&rsquo;s blessing is that we must exercise our spirit. We must exercise our spirit at all times in order to receive His blessing. Our spirit is strengthened whenever it is exercised. If we do not exercise our spirit during the regular meetings of the church, it will be difficult to exercise our spirit when we are serving in the young people&rsquo;s meeting. The church has not advanced much because the saints are waiting to be inspired by the Spirit and thus are not exercised in their spirit. The thought of waiting for the Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration is an erroneous concept.</p>
<p>Those who serve the young people should come together to pray for the young people&rsquo;s meeting. If there is a preparation time before the young people&rsquo;s meeting, the serving ones should come early and pray together. It is not good for serving ones to be singing during the preparation time while others arrive late and at a leisurely pace. Someone who comes late does not have an attitude that corresponds to a serving spirit. If a person has a serving spirit, he will arrive early because he is burdened inwardly, not because he is following a pre-arranged schedule. If the saints have a serving spirit, they will arrive early to pray and sing. Thus, when they go to the young people&rsquo;s meeting, the meeting will be living, and the atmosphere will be absolutely different.</p>
<p>If the serving ones prepare material related to some points and only begin to exercise their spirit when they arrive at the young people&rsquo;s meeting, this is not a proper attitude. If they do not exercise their spirit regularly, their time in the young people&rsquo;s meeting will only be a performance. When some saints begin to serve with the young people, they have a burden, and they pray. However, as they continue to serve, their service becomes routine, and they do not continue to pray. Then their service becomes a duty that they force themselves to fulfill. A serving one should be a man of prayer, even if he is serving only out of a sense of duty. The Yangtze River in China flows continuously; it flows whether people need water or not. Likewise, when a serving one is preparing to give a message, he needs to pray, but even if he is not giving a message, he still needs to fellowship with the Lord. It is not enough to pray only when he has to give a message. His fellowship and prayer with the Lord should be continual, just like the continual flowing of the Yangtze River.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT CONSISTENTLY<br />
TO KEEP OURSELVES FRESH AND LIVING</h2>
<p>Even the responsible brothers who are taking the lead do not have a consistent exercise of the spirit. We need to pray desperately for this situation because this affects our work with the young people. A brother once asked me what he needed to do in order to keep his spirit fresh and living. The only answer is that we must exercise our spirit. If we do not exercise our spirit, we will become old, but if we learn to exercise our spirit, we will be fresh and living.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to try this: exercise your spirit in every situation, neither exhibiting nor humbling yourself in a conscious manner, forsaking both pride and humility and without any thought of being hidden or manifested in your exercise. Instead, simply exercise your spirit. Try this and see if you become fresh and living. If you exercise in this way, another person may read a verse in a dead and old way, but your reading will be fresh and living. It will be fresh and living because your reading will come out of the exercise of the spirit. When you exercise your spirit, you will be in Christ, and in Christ the old things have passed away and have become new (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>For example, when we are in a meeting and read a verse, we can often sense that some saints are reading in a living way and others are not. This is not merely a matter of tone or emphasis, because even the mimicking of a certain tone cannot eliminate a sense of death. The only thing that matters is whether we are exercising our spirit continually. This is the key to whether or not we are fresh and living. The church is in need of this revolutionary change, but it will not be easy for those who are not accustomed to exercising their spirit. I hope that an atmosphere of exercising the spirit will be gradually cultivated among our young people. The young brothers and sisters should have such an attitude when they come to the meeting; they should not wait for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT AND BEING MOVED<br />
BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The concept of waiting to be inspired by the Holy Spirit is not according to the Bible. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Whenever we come together, some will have a song, a teaching, a revelation, and so forth. Brother Nee spent a great deal of time to study this verse in the original Greek language. He discovered that <em>each one has</em> does not mean that each one will have something after arriving at the meeting; rather, it means that each one already has something before coming to the meeting. Hence, having something is not a matter of sudden inspiration in a meeting. Our meeting can be likened to playing a basketball game. The players on the court do not play based on inspiration. They have to be ready to receive the ball whenever it is passed to them and from whatever direction it comes. They cannot say that they will catch the ball when they feel inspired to do so. This is not a proper attitude. However, some saints have this kind of attitude. They care only for the matter of their own inspiration, not for others. Consequently, when everyone is singing a hymn with full enjoyment, they are unmoved and inactive. We should meet in the same way that basketball is played. When the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; comes, we should respond. When a hymn is called, we should follow the movement of the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; and sing. After one offers a prayer, another can strengthen it with a hymn. After singing the hymn, still others can continue to pass the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; with additional prayer. In this way we will be coordinated together. Coordination requires initiative rather than inspiration. Actively exercising our spirit in this way is very different from passively waiting for the Spirit. Actively exercising our spirit is the scriptural way to meet.</p>
<p>In our experience the opening of our mouth is rarely the result of inspiration from the Spirit; rather, it is the result of simply taking the initiative to speak. Often the real move of the Spirit comes only when we open our mouth to speak. Even though some brothers pray only when they are about to give a message, the Spirit still comes when they pray. Similarly, when others bear the responsibility to pray in a meeting, the Spirit comes as soon as they pray. This is an amazing thing. If we bear no responsibility and take no initiative, it seems as if the Spirit does not move, but once we bear some responsibility, the Spirit comes. Is such a result the issue of the movement of the Spirit or of the initiative of the brother? According to our experience, when we take the initiative to serve, rather than waiting passively for the inspiration of the Spirit, the Spirit moves. I believe that we understand this key, but we need to apply it consistently.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEVOTING TIME AND ENERGY<br />
TO EXERCISE OUR SPIRIT<br />
AND LEARNING TO SPEAK FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>In order to have proper meetings with the young people, we must improve in two areas. First, we must exercise our spirit, and second, we must learn and practice the skills that are needed in order to speak for the Lord. No one can do these two things for us. In regard to our service with the young people, we are not short of material. Furthermore, we have the support of the churches. However, those of us who work with the young people are short in the exercise of the spirit and in the skills needed to speak for the Lord. These two matters are crucial. If we address these two aspects in an adequate way, however, we will be able to achieve something. But if we fail to address these matters, we will not have any results. Hence, we must be trained to exercise our spirit and learn the skills that are needed in order to speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>The important thing in leading the young people&rsquo;s meeting is not the preparation of material, because much material is already available. However, the exercise of the spirit and the skills needed to speak cannot be provided by others. Although two people may use the same material, one may produce a certain kind of flavor, whereas another person will produce a different kind of flavor. The difference in the flavor is determined by the exercise of the spirit and the skills that have been learned. Both aspects require time and energy in order to exercise and learn; no one can do this for us. Even though parents try their best to educate their children, their children must learn to read and write for themselves by devoting time and energy to practice and learn. No one can learn for them. It is not possible to learn merely by watching others; we must practice for ourselves.</p>
<p>I hope that all the saints are clear that leading the young people&rsquo;s meeting requires much more than merely preparing material for them. Both the exercise of the spirit and the skills needed in order to speak for the Lord require time, energy, and practice. There is no shortcut or easy way. Everyone who serves must know how to use his spirit and practice speaking. If we do not practice and learn these two matters, our success will be minimal at best.</p>
<p>In short, with other factors being in place, the key to our success lies in the exercise of the spirit and in the practice of our speaking. If we are willing to exercise our spirit and practice our speaking, the number in the young people&rsquo;s meeting will reach one thousand within a year. It is easy to gain an increase among the young people because every one of them can bring another young person to salvation each year. However, it is not easy for the young ones to lead the ones whom they have gained. If there is a meeting for them, it will be very easy to progress, and many will be saved. It would not be difficult to have a twofold increase in a year, but everything depends upon the amount of time and energy we devote. There are many basketball teams, but when some teams play, no one wants to go to their games, but when other teams play, it is hard to get a ticket to the game. The difference lies in how much effort a team has devoted to advancing. Different efforts will reap different results. We should not overlook the young people&rsquo;s meeting. Rather, we should do a solid and focused work and always make progress. If our work is progressing well, however, we should be wary of becoming proud.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h2 class="head1">TOUCHING THE YOUNG PEOPLE&rsquo;S SPIRIT<br />
BEING ESSENTIAL IN OUR LEADING</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship briefly concerning how to lead the young people. When we lead the young people in matters related to life, we should charge them to practice the points that we cover. In the following meeting we should review the point that was covered and fellowship about their practice. Then we can introduce another point. When we are leading the young people&rsquo;s meeting, our spirit must be strong since it is possible to fall into a doctrinal discussion because of the substantial educational element associated with teaching spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>Young people like to use their mind. Even as children they use their mind and engage in reasoning. Consequently, our teaching can hinder them spiritually if our spirit is not strong, uplifted, and released in the meeting. When we open our mouth to speak or pray, our spirit should be released. When our spirit is released, it is easy for their spirit to be stirred up. Such an atmosphere will affect them strongly. Without the release of the spirit, the young people&rsquo;s meeting will fall into the realm of knowledge. If we give the young people a small amount of Bible knowledge in every meeting but do not touch their spirit, we will be giving them only educational points. Even though these points are different in content from the general education in the world, they will have no reality without the release of the spirit.</p>
<p>According to my observation, we fail to touch the spirit of the young ones in the young people&rsquo;s meetings. Some of them come to the young people&rsquo;s meeting or the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting simply because their parents are Christians. However, they do not receive much supply in their spirit. At the most they receive a little knowledge. This is because those who are leading the meeting are neither fresh nor strong in their spirit. While it is true that we should give them something that is educational in nature, it is even more important that we touch their spirit. Our leading should have a component of both education and spiritual exercise. On one hand, they should receive something educational to instruct their mind and focus their intellect. On the other hand, our leading should touch their spirit in a fresh and living way. At the same time, they should be encouraged to exercise their spirit to pray so that the Spirit can touch them in their spirit. As the young ones learn to pray, they will also experience being enlivened in their spirit. When they begin to pray, an atmosphere of prayer will be manifested, and gradually, their prayer will come out of the spirit. Then they will receive a genuine supply in the meeting. In this way the knowledge that they receive will be matched by the supply in the spirit.</p>
<p>Being supplied in spirit cannot be separated from receiving knowledge, because every person has a mind as well as a spirit. Our leading of the young people should involve instruction for their mind. However, if our instruction has no element of the release of the spirit, our leading will be ineffective. When we speak to the young people, our word must be educational in nature, having an intellectual component, but at the same time, our spirit must be strong and full. In this way our words will convey an element of the spirit. We must release our spirit when we speak, when we pray, and when we sing in order to touch the spirit of the young people. Our instruction of knowledge and our stirring up of the spirit must occur simultaneously. Knowledge enlightens the mind, whereas the release of the spirit touches the spirit. When our intellect is enlightened and our spirit is open, our fellowship with the Lord will result in receiving a genuine supply.</p>
<p>It is not easy to lead the young people&rsquo;s meeting. Some think that it is easier to lead the young people&rsquo;s meeting than it is to lead a regular meeting. This is a wrong concept. From a certain standpoint, it is easy for the young ones to be stirred up to pursue the Lord; but from another standpoint, it is not easy for young people to genuinely touch their spirit. The young people are easily excited, and they can easily be touched in their intellect. However, leading them to touch their spirit is often much more difficult than leading the older saints. In order to lead the young people, we must be strong in our spirit.</p>
<p>In the young people&rsquo;s meeting, we should pay attention as to whether or not the number of those who are attending is increasing. Furthermore, we must also pay attention to whether or not the young people are comprehending and receiving the teaching that is being given. Even more important, however, we need to see a response in their spirit. Every young person must have a strong response in his spirit at least once in order to have a genuine change before the Lord. We also must contact the young people individually and apart from the young people&rsquo;s meeting. If we do not have time to contact every one of them, we should seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading and make contact with them individually according to the need. During our contact, we should exercise our spirit so that we touch their spirit and cause their spirit to be enlivened.</p>
<p>In the young people&rsquo;s meeting, the most crucial matter involves the spirit of the young ones being enlivened. Therefore, the speaking related to the material that has been prepared should be limited. If we speak too much, they will receive it only with their mind. If we continue in this way for six months, the majority of what they receive from the meetings will be related to the material rather than to the moving and activity in their spirit. Such a result goes against the nature of a Christian meeting, which should be focused on supplying people with the spirit. Nevertheless, in order to supply others with the spirit, we also need to enlighten their mind. In the world the purpose of education is solely directed toward developing the human intellect; there is no consideration of the spirit. However, when we speak a message, we should impart a spiritual education for the purpose of touching their spirit. If we only instruct the mind without reaching the spirit, we have utterly fallen short of our goal, and our work will be in vain. Consequently, those who are involved with the young people&rsquo;s meeting should be very clear that the goal of using the materials to instruct the young saints is to touch their spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INCARNATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>For the remainder of this message, we need to present another major point of teaching concerning Christ. In chapter 2 we saw the divinity of Christ, and in chapter 4 we saw Christ in His relation to all things. Now we will look at the incarnation of Christ. A Christian must know the Lord in His incarnation more thoroughly than in any other matter because this is the turning point, the central point. All the points previously fellowshipped depend on this point, and all the subsequent points that we will fellowship come out of this point. In other words, everything that the Lord has done was either for His incarnation or depends upon His incarnation. Without His incarnation, the Lord would be meaningless to us. Hence, this point is central and crucial. We should present the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation to the young people from several vantage points.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Prophecy concerning Incarnation</h2>
<p>We should begin by speaking of the prophecy concerning the incarnation. In the Bible the prophecy concerning the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation is very clear, and it is recorded in numerous places, but we will consider only two verses. In Genesis 3:15, after man fell, God said to the serpent, &ldquo;I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head, / But you will bruise him on the heel.&rdquo; At first glance, the phrase <em>her seed,</em> that is, the woman&rsquo;s seed, seems quite simple, but the implications of it are very profound. First, God&rsquo;s speaking related to the seed of a woman coming forth clearly indicates the matter of birth. Second, this birth involves a human being, because the seed is of a woman. Third, the seed who would be born according to this prophecy would be different from every other person born in the world because they are the seed of a man rather than of a woman. The fact that this human seed is the seed of a woman indicates that this seed is different in both origin and nature. The seed of a man comes out of man; as such, its origin is of man, and it has the nature of man. However, the seed in this prophecy comes out of the seed of a woman; as such and by inference, His origin is of God, and He has the nature of God. Therefore, the simple phrase <em>her seed,</em> the seed of the woman, infers that God would come to be a man through incarnation. This is the first prophecy in the Bible concerning God&rsquo;s coming to be a man.</p>
<p>The second prophecy is in Isaiah 7:14, which says, &ldquo;The virgin will conceive and will bear a son.&rdquo; This verse closely follows the thought related to the seed of the woman, because the Son born of the virgin is the seed of the woman prophesied in Genesis 3:15. Christ is indeed the seed of the woman, because His birth involved only a woman, a human virgin. Isaiah 7:14 continues, saying, &ldquo;She will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; The name Immanuel means &ldquo;God with us,&rdquo; that is, God with man. This reveals the special source and particular nature of the woman&rsquo;s seed spoken of in Genesis 3. The Son born of the virgin was called God with man, indicating that He is God with man, God joined to man, God mingled with man. He has the element of humanity as well as the element of divinity. In His name God and man, man and God, are joined. Thus, the prophecy of God&rsquo;s coming to be a man, God&rsquo;s incarnation, is very clear.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Accomplishment of Incarnation</h2>
<p>The accomplishment of the prophecy of God&rsquo;s incarnation in the Old Testament is spoken of at the beginning of the New Testament. We will consider two portions. Matthew 1:20-23 says, &ldquo;An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph...do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins. Now all this has happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, &lsquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel&rsquo; (which is translated, God with us).&rdquo; This portion clearly tells us that the prophecy in the Old Testament has been fulfilled. A virgin was indeed with child, and her being with child was of the Holy Spirit, indicating that the source was the Holy Spirit, that is, God. The Son born of her would also be the Savior of sinners; that is, He would save us from our sins. Hence, His name was called Jesus, meaning &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior.&rdquo; <em>Jesus</em> is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name <em>Joshua</em> (Num. 13:16), which means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the salvation of Jehovah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Galatians 4:4 says, &ldquo;When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under law.&rdquo; This is God incarnated, the expression of God, the manifestation of God. The Son of God is God manifested. A son expresses his father. Hence, the Son of God is the expression of God; He is also God expressed. The expression of God was born of a woman and became a man; this is incarnation. The God who became flesh fulfilled the prophecy of incarnation.</p><h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Incarnation</h2>
<p>We can see the meaning of incarnation by looking at several verses. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; Simply put, the Word is God expressed and also the expressed God. The incarnated God is not a hidden God but an expressed God. The expressed God is the Word who became flesh. <em>Flesh</em> does not refer merely to human beings in general but also to mankind after the fall. When the Lord Jesus came to be flesh, man was fallen. Hence, the flesh that He put on refers to fallen man, or we may say that He put on fallen man. When speaking of this truth, we must be very precise.</p>
<p>Romans 8:3 says, &ldquo;God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin.&rdquo; We should point out that even though the expressed God became a man, we should not assume, based on John 1:14 alone, that this expressed God was a sinful man. We must also consider Romans 8:3, which shows that even though He became flesh, He came only in the likeness of a fallen man outwardly without having the fallen nature, the nature of sin inwardly. This is illustrated in the type of the bronze serpent. In John 3:14 the Lord said, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo; The bronze serpent lifted up by Moses in the wilderness is a type of the Lord Himself (Num. 21:4-9). The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but not the element of the serpent&rsquo;s poison, the nature of the serpent. After the Lord Jesus became flesh, He had the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the sinful nature of fallen man. Romans 8:3 speaks of the likeness of the flesh of sin, which proves that the Lord came in the likeness of the flesh of sin but did not have the nature of sin.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:7 speaks of the Lord taking &ldquo;the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men,&rdquo; and verse 8 says that in His &ldquo;being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.&rdquo; Although God was joined to man and expressed through man in incarnation, He did not have man&rsquo;s sinful nature. Nevertheless, He was a genuine man, not a fake man, becoming, in reality, in the likeness of men.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2:14 says, &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil.&rdquo; This verse proves that when the Lord was incarnated, He had blood and flesh, the elements of man. First Timothy 2:5 says, &ldquo;There is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.&rdquo; The phrase <em>the man</em> is emphatic; it means that the Lord is indeed a man. He is no different from us other than the fact that He is without sin. He became a man and is a man. First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s becoming flesh is God&rsquo;s expression of Himself in the flesh. Except for the fact that He does not have the element of sin, He is the same as every man. He is the manifested God, the God who is expressed in the flesh.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Issue of Incarnation</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15 speaks of the issue of the incarnation. Verse 45 speaks of a &ldquo;last Adam,&rdquo; and verse 47 speaks of a &ldquo;second man.&rdquo; This shows that the Lord is the last man as well as the second man. From these two portions of the Scriptures, we can see that there are only two men in the universe; the first Adam, who is the first man, and the last Adam, who is the second man. As the last Adam, the Lord is the second man, which proves that He is a man. This second man is the mingling of God and man, a second man produced through incarnation. The issue of the incarnation is that another man was produced in the universe. Formerly, there was only one man in the universe, who was out of the earth. Through the incarnation of God, the last Adam, who is also the second man, was produced. This man is out of heaven. Therefore, before the incarnation of God, there was only one man in the universe, the first Adam. When the Lord was incarnated, a second man was produced, who is also the last Adam.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:3 speaks of Christ as the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory and the impress of His substance. The Lord&rsquo;s incarnation is the shining of the glory of God and the expression of the impress of the substance of God. In the incarnation God is expressed through man. John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; The issue of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation is that the last Adam, the second man, was produced and that God was expressed and declared. Matthew 1:23 says, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel (which is translated, God with us).&rdquo; Through the birth of the Lord, Emmanuel, who is God with us, came forth. This is wonderful.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
TO KNOW THE LORD<br />
AS THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: June 2, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
BY THE SPIRIT BEING THE REAL HELP</h2>
<p>Those who lead the young people&rsquo;s meeting must lead the young people to pray. This is a matter of great importance. There are several ways to lead a meeting. Some lead by emphasizing knowledge, and others lead by appealing to people&rsquo;s emotions. These kinds of leading will result in only a small amount of help. Strictly speaking, genuine help can be rendered only by leading the meeting with the spirit; hence, there is a need for prayer in the spirit.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves whether we are leading the college students with knowledge, related to doctrines, and emotions or with the spirit. We must lead them with the spirit. If we want to lead the young people to pray, we must be strong in spirit and have sufficient prayer ourselves. If we do not have a strong spirit and do not pray, we should not expect the young people to pray in the meeting. We must have a praying spirit, a spirit that is living and fresh, so that we can lead the young people to pray more in the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prayer Helping the Saints to Be Open</h2>
<p>When I was with the saints in Baguio, there was much prayer. While we were on the mountain, the saints spent at least half of the time in prayer. Not many prayed on the first day, but the number of saints who prayed began to slowly increase. After seven or eight days almost everyone was praying in the meeting. They also had personal times of prayer, but most importantly, they prayed in the meetings. After breakfast and before the meeting, they would pray. There were also many opportunities for them to pray after the meeting. There was much prayer both before and after a meeting. Their prayer was very beneficial to them. Through their prayer, their spirit was opened, and the Holy Spirit was able to impart into them the message that was released in the meeting. Without prayer, it would have been difficult for the content of the message to be imparted into them. We must lead the young people to pray regularly so that their spirit will be open. In this way the word will enter into them and provide them with real help.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to this point: In our meetings we should do more than just speak, we should lead the young people in a way that causes their spirit to be open to the Lord. If our speaking is filled with only our logic and concepts, an adequate spiritual supply will not be rendered, and our message will not edify the young people. However, if we desire to lead them to be open before the Lord or to lead them to pray, our spirit must first be opened to Him. If our spirit is not fresh or living, if we do not have a spirit of prayer, and if we do not pray, it will be impossible to lead the young people to pray. If our spirit is weak because of a lack of prayer, we should not expect the young people to be able to pray in a strong way. Furthermore, if our thoughts are not logical and clear when we give a message, those who hear will not have a logical and clear understanding of the content.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Change the Concept of Meeting<br />
That Stresses the Truth but Neglects Prayer</h2>
<p>In both the young people&rsquo;s meetings and the larger meetings of the church, the matter of truth has been stressed to the neglect of prayer. In all the churches there is more stress on matters related to truth than to prayer. This has been a great shortcoming among us. Both the knowledge of the truth and the exercise of the spirit must be stressed equally. In a meeting the truth should be presented with a strong spirit that renders a spiritual supply to others. In every meeting we should release and open our spirit, and those who take the lead in the meetings should release and open their spirit. This requires much prayer. The more we pray, the more prayer we will have in the meeting. I am concerned that those who lead the young people&rsquo;s meeting spend much more time preparing for a message than in prayer. If there is an inadequate exercise of the spirit, only an objective knowledge of doctrines will be stressed. We must correct this situation by stressing prayer and the exercise of the spirit as much as the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>In the conference and training in Baguio, we grasped this point, and we spent more time in the matter of prayer. Although sixty percent of the time was devoted to prayer and forty percent was related to the truth, the truth was ministered into them with a praying spirit. Hence, the help they received in the spirit was genuine and living. We must not pay attention to methods but to our person. If the leading ones do not pray, those under their leading also will not pray. Those who lack a spirit of prayer should not expect that those under their leading will have a spirit of prayer. The leading ones must exercise their spirit and pray much so that their spirit will be strong, fresh, living, and released.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SITUATION IN CHRISTIANITY<br />
FORCING GOD TO REACT</h2>
<p>According to our observation, the concept of the brothers in the churches has not changed sufficiently in regard to serving by and in the spirit. It seems as if the exercise of their spirit always lags behind the use of their intellect, reason, emotion, feelings, and will. This is a great problem with us, and it is an even greater problem in Christianity as a whole. It is no wonder then that God has reacted in response to this situation. One example of God&rsquo;s reaction has been His allowance of the emergence of the Pentecostal movement. In this reaction emphasis on the Spirit overpowered all other considerations and all emphasis on the intellect was put aside. Nevertheless, God still allowed this reaction to occur even though it went too far. When we consider the Pentecostal movement solely from the aspect of the Spirit, we must realize that Christianity had fallen into a situation of dead knowledge, ordinances, rituals, regulations, and doctrines. Consequently, meetings that stressed such things as sitting quietly with a Bible, singing hymns, and listening to intellectual messages forced God to raise up an environment, a movement, to overthrow this emphasis on objective things.</p>
<p>Although we may not agree with everything associated with the Pentecostal movement, we must admit that the reaction associated with this movement occurred with God&rsquo;s permission. For example, in meetings where everyone was sitting so properly in their chairs, God reacted by causing some to roll on the floor. Many criticized these ones, saying that it was wrong to roll on the floor and jump in the meeting, but a considerable number were saved in their midst. In contrast, many who were brought into the denominations by &ldquo;proper&rdquo; pastors were not even genuinely saved. Those brought into the Pentecostal movement, however, truly repented and were saved. Even though some came from very dark backgrounds, including addiction to opium and possession by demons, all of this darkness fell away after their Pentecostal experiences related to salvation. Even though many of their practices are questionable, we should not deny that they are related to God&rsquo;s reaction to the situation in Christianity.</p>
<p>Even though we are God&rsquo;s children, having been regenerated with God&rsquo;s life and serving Him in some capacity, we must admit that our spirit is still rather weak. When we come together, we are either focused on intellectual or emotional things. In other words, our soul is the leading part of our being, not our spirit. This is an undeniable fact. Hence, the leading in our meetings is very poor, and it is difficult for our spirit to be living. This is true not only in the young people&rsquo;s meeting but also when the whole church comes together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THOSE WHO ARE IN THE MEETING<br />
TO PRAY AND OPEN THEIR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Acts 6:4 says, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; Prayer is a matter of the spirit, whereas the ministry of the word is a matter related to knowledge and the mind. Today, however, it seems as if we carry out only the ministry of the word and neglect the matter of prayer. Although we do not know whether the apostles prayed before or after a meeting, we know that they prayed. Consequently, when we bear responsibility for a meeting, we must endeavor to lead those who are in the meeting to pray; we must lead them into the matter of prayer.</p>
<p>In the past we suffered because we would bring people to the meetings but not lead them to pray. In one of the meeting halls in Taipei, there are at least sixty people who attend the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. According to observation, however, half of them never open their mouth. This is a fact. Among the sixty who break bread, thirty never open their mouth. If this is the situation in the bread-breaking meeting, it is even more noticeable in the ministry meeting, where many come and only listen to a message. Of the three to four hundred who come to the ministry meeting, less than one hundred pray. In other words, less than twenty-five percent of those who listen to the messages exercise to pray in the meeting. Some saints have been in this condition for many years. Although they may have listened to messages for ten years, they have never prayed in a meeting. Messages have been continually released, but their spirit has not been open. It is no wonder that the word cannot penetrate their being. This is like a person who tries to take food into his stomach through his nostrils rather than his mouth. Such an effort will have no effect. Similarly, we have been giving messages for many years, but there has been little to no effect.</p>
<p>This is the same situation in relation to our gospel preaching. Some come to our gospel meetings every week to listen to our speaking, but we do not lead them to pray. Hence, it is very difficult for them to be saved. We do not need to wait for another week to pass; we can preach the gospel and immediately lead our gospel friends to open their mouth and pray. When we preach the gospel to others, it is imperative that we open their spirit through the exercise of the spirit. As soon as their spirit is open, they will be saved. This is a basic principle in leading people to salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING THE SAINTS TO HAVE<br />
A GENUINE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Presently, the most urgent thing is to help the young people to have a genuine knowledge of the Spirit, because the genuine experience of life is altogether a matter in the spirit. Spiritual life is a matter of the Spirit. The Gospel of John shows that we are born of the Spirit (3:6) and that we worship the Spirit with our spirit (4:24). When we are filled with the Spirit inwardly, the words that we speak will also be spirit, flowing out unceasingly to become rivers of living water (7:38-39). Genuine spiritual experience is altogether a matter of the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;He Who Is Joined to the Lord Is One Spirit&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A few verses will strengthen the young people&rsquo;s knowledge concerning their spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; All that the Lord is doing in us is related to our being joined to Him. Our spiritual life is the issue of being joined to the Lord. Without being joined to the Lord, we could not have any spiritual experience.</p>
<p>If a person does not have the Lord, he does not have life, because the Lord is life (John 14:6). Hence, in order to have life, we must have the Lord. First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; Having the Son of God means that we are in union with the Lord, but we still need to understand how we are joined to the Lord. First Corinthians 6:17 tells us clearly that being joined to the Lord is a matter of being one spirit with him. We are joined to the Lord because we are one spirit with the Lord.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 6:17 is a great verse in the Bible. Strictly speaking, when the Lord comes to us, He comes as the Spirit, not as the Father or the Son. When we present this point to others, we should be precise so that there will be no misunderstanding. The Son is in the Spirit, and the Father is in the Son. We cannot receive the Son or know the Father without the Spirit. Our receiving of the Son and our knowing of the Father is entirely a matter related to the Spirit in our spirit. Even the Lord&rsquo;s entrance into us as life is a matter in the spirit. This point is confirmed by the fact that the Holy Spirit received by the disciples in John 20:22 is spoken of in Romans 8:2 as the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>When 1 Corinthians 6:17 speaks of our union with the Lord, it is in the context of our being one spirit with Him. The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). When He comes to us, He comes as the Spirit. Moreover, when He enters into us to be our life, He enters as the Spirit. In order for us to receive the Lord, we cannot use our mind, emotion, or will. We also cannot gain Him by striving or studying. We must use our spirit to receive Him because His being joined to us is as one spirit.</p>
<p>We do not need to give too much knowledge to the young brothers and sisters; nevertheless, we know that students in high school and college pay close attention to matters related to reason. Therefore, we need to stress this point concerning the spirit. We must show them that God wants us to be joined to Him and that it is only through a union in one spirit that we can receive God and God can become everything to us. Since God is Spirit, He comes to us as the Spirit, and when He enters into our spirit to be our life, He enters as the Spirit. Therefore, we must use our spirit to receive God as Spirit.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 6:17 does not speak of two spirits but of two spirits that have become one spirit. In other words, two spirits&mdash;God the Spirit and our human spirit&mdash;have become one spirit. When we are joined to the Lord and become one with Him, this oneness is the issue of two spirits becoming one spirit. This means that the Lord, who is the Spirit, has come into our spirit to become one with our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;If Anyone Does Not Have the Spirit of Christ,<br />
He Is Not of Him&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Romans 8:9 says, &ldquo;If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.&rdquo; If we are of Christ, we have the Spirit of Christ. Anyone who is of Christ is joined to Christ; as such, such a one surely has the Spirit of Christ in him. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; This verse does not say that the Lord is one person and that the Spirit is another person. The Lord being the Spirit means that the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself. Just as our spirit is inseparable from us, the Spirit of Christ is just Christ Himself. Romans 8:9 speaks of the Spirit of Christ rather than just Christ because it is in the context of Paul&rsquo;s speaking concerning our union with Christ. If the Lord were not the Spirit, He could not enter into us and be joined with us. Neither could we be joined to Christ and be of Him. The fact that we belong to Christ, are joined to Christ, and have become one with Christ is altogether related to the fact that the Lord is the Spirit. As the Spirit, He can enter into our human spirit so that these two spirits can become one. This is the reason that verse 9 speaks of the Spirit of Christ instead of Christ.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Christ does not refer to another person. We should not think that Christ is one person and that the Spirit of Christ is another. We must always remember that the Spirit of Christ is Christ, that Christ and the Spirit of Christ are one. Christ is God who was incarnated, who died for our sins on the cross, who resurrected from the dead, and who has entered into us. However, when He enters into us, He enters as the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ is the resurrected Christ entering into our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 speaks of our being joined to the Lord from a positive perspective, whereas Romans 8:9 speaks of our being joined to the Lord from a negative perspective, that is, that anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ is not joined to Christ and does not belong to Christ. We must present these two perspectives to the young brothers and sisters until they understand.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORDS SPOKEN BY THE LORD<br />
BEING SPIRIT AND LIFE</h2>
<p>After we are saved, we have the Lord&rsquo;s life. From that time onward, our relationship with the Lord is altogether a matter of union in spirit. Hence, we should not neglect the spirit by relying merely on messages. We should use our spirit to listen to a message, and we should use our spirit to digest the message that we understand with our mind. When giving a message, the speaker&rsquo;s words should open the listeners&rsquo; mind and understanding so that the Spirit, through the spoken words, can pass through the listeners&rsquo; mind and enter into their spirit. This must be the goal of giving a message. The words spoken in a message serve as an opener, a forerunner, and a lead into the spirit. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit&rdquo; (John 6:63). In this verse the Lord&rsquo;s words are a guide and herald of the Spirit. Although the Lord speaks the words, they become spirit and life to us when they pass through our understanding and enter into our spirit. Hence, if we desire to contact the Lord and be joined to Him, we cannot rely merely on our mind to understand His words. We must allow the words to open our mind and enter into our spirit through our mind. Next, we must receive the Lord&rsquo;s words with our spirit. Once the Lord&rsquo;s words enter into our spirit, they become the Spirit, and as soon as the words become the Spirit, they are life to us. When this is our experience, the words that the Lord speaks are Spirit and life to us.</p>
<p>Why does the Lord, who is the Spirit, have to enter into us through His words? The Spirit becomes words because human beings have a mind, and everything that is not physical enters into us through our mind and thoughts. Without passing through our mind and thoughts, nothing spiritual can enter into us. In order for the Lord who is the Spirit to enter into us, He must pass through our mind. To this end, as the Spirit, He becomes words that can open our mind and our understanding. Once our mind and our understanding are opened, that is, once the gate to our person is opened, the Lord&rsquo;s words can enter into our inner chamber, our spirit. As soon as these words enter into our spirit, they become the Spirit. Once these words become the Spirit, they are life to us. Hence, we should not be satisfied with the young people merely listening to a message. The message must open their understanding, change their concept, and leave a clear impression in their thoughts. This will open the gate to their spirit so that the words that they receive in their spirit will become the Spirit and be life to them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THAT THE FATHER HAS BEING THE SON&rsquo;S, AND<br />
THE HOLY SPIRIT RECEIVING ALL THAT THE SON<br />
HAS AND DECLARING IT TO THE DISCIPLES</h2>
<p>At this point we need to consider John 16:15, which is important, even though it is not easy to understand. In this verse, the Lord said, &ldquo;All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He [the Holy Spirit] receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; This verse often is neglected and put aside. It states that the Holy Spirit receives all that the Lord Jesus has and discloses it to us. In this short verse, there are four main points. First, <em>all that the Father has</em> refers to <em>all the fullness of the Godhead</em> in Colossians 2:9. Second, <em>is Mine</em> refers to <em>in Him dwells</em> in Colossians 2:9. <em>All that the Father has is Mine</em> means that all the fullness of the Godhead is in Christ. Third, in reference to the Holy Spirit <em>He receives of Mine</em> means that the Spirit receives all that the Son has. Hence, according to John 16:15, all that the Father has is given to the Son, and all that the Son has is received by the Spirit. We also can say all that is of the Father is in the Son, and all that is of the Son is in the Spirit. In order to have a complete understanding of verse 15, we must look at some preceding verses. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality.&rdquo; In verse 7 the Lord Jesus told His disciples, &ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter [the Holy Spirit] will not come to you.&rdquo; This means that if the Comforter does not come, all the reality that is in the Son will not be able to enter into the disciples. All that is of the Father can only be in the Son, but all that is of the Son cannot enter into the disciples unless the Holy Spirit, as the Comforter, comes. In order for all that is of the Father to not only be in the Son but also to reach the disciples, the Holy Spirit must come, because He receives all that the Son has. Fourth, <em>will declare it to you</em> in verse 15 corresponds to <em>guide you into</em> in verse 13. All that is of the Father is in the Son, all that is of the Son is received by the Spirit, and all that the Spirit receives is declared to us and revealed in us by the Spirit&rsquo;s guiding us into all the reality.</p>
<p>We must clearly tell the young people that they must touch the Spirit if they desire to touch God and gain Christ practically. We need to touch the Spirit because all that is of the Father is given to the Son, and all that is of the Son is received by the Spirit. Without knowing and touching the Spirit, we cannot touch anything of the Son. This is the reason we say that we need to use more than our mind when we listen to a message. We must let the words open our mind, pass through our mind, and enter into our spirit to become the Spirit. All that the Son has, which is all that the Father has, is in the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE AND THE SPIRIT BEING INSEPARABLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Words of the Bible Entering into Our Spirit<br />
and Becoming the Spirit</h2>
<p>In leading the young people, we must clearly show them the difference between the Bible, which is outside of us, and the Spirit, who indwells us. Although the Bible is outside of us and the Spirit indwells us, the two in reality are one and should not be separated in our concept. The Spirit is the Spirit of the Bible, and the Bible contains the words of the Spirit. The Bible is the utterance of the Spirit so that our mind can understand. When the words of the Bible open our mind, they pass through our mind and enter into our spirit; thus, the words of the Bible become the Spirit. Whenever we understand the words of the Bible with our mind and receive them with our spirit, we sense that the Spirit, not merely the words of the Bible, has entered into our spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit outside of us is the reality of the Bible, and when the words of the Bible enter into us, we realize them as the Spirit. The entire Bible, but especially the Gospel of John, shows us that the Lord is the Word and the Spirit (1:1; 4:24; 6:63). The Lord must be the Word so that we can understand and comprehend Him in our mind, and the Lord must be the Spirit so that He can enter into our spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s words can open our thoughts and mind, and when we understand His words, our spirit can receive His words, which then become the Spirit. The Bible is the forerunner and guide for the Holy Spirit to open our mind. The reality of the Spirit outside of us is the Bible, and the realization of the words of the Bible inside of us is the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Letter Killing but the Spirit Giving Life</h2>
<p>We should never read the Bible without receiving the Spirit. If we merely read the Bible and do not receive the Spirit, the Bible will be of no benefit to us as dead letter and dead doctrines. Without receiving the Spirit, our reading will be similar to that of the Pharisees, who cared only for the black and white letters contained in the Old Testament and not for life in the Scriptures. As a result, the Pharisees fell into the dead letter and were condemned by the Scriptures instead of being saved by them. This is because the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life (2 Cor. 3:6). If the Bible is merely the letter outside of us, it will bring us into death. However, when the words of the Bible become the Spirit in our spirit, we receive life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">Christ Making His Home in Our Heart<br />
through the Revelation of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Based on John 16:15, we must present to the young people the truth that all that the Father has is in the Son and all that the Son has is received by the Spirit. Thus, when the Spirit comes, He reveals all that He received of the Son to us. The Spirit&rsquo;s revelation is through the words in the Bible, which enable us to understand and comprehend in our mind. However, we should not be limited to just understanding with our mind, we must receive the words with our spirit. All that we understand and comprehend in our mind should be turned into prayer in our spirit. The more we pray with our spirit, the more we will receive in our spirit, and what we receive in our spirit will be the rich Spirit, not the black and white letter in the Bible. When we contact and receive this rich Spirit and fellowship with Him, He will gradually reveal all that is of Christ. Thus, we will enjoy all the riches of God in Christ. This is related to Ephesians 3:17 and 19, which speak of Christ making His home in our hearts through faith so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<p>When Christ makes His home in our hearts, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God, because the Spirit in our spirit, through the words in the Bible, will reveal Christ in us. Christ can make His home in us only through the revelation of the Spirit, and the result of Christ&rsquo;s making His home in us is that all the riches of God in Christ will fill our inner being so that we become the fullness of God, God&rsquo;s expression. Becoming the fullness of God is the result of the Spirit&rsquo;s declaring and revealing all that the Son has from the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Speaking everything in this chapter to the young people all at once may be too challenging. It is important, however, that they have a change in their concept. They must understand the Lord&rsquo;s words and receive them with their spirit. We should help them to realize that God and Christ come to them through words that can be understood, comprehended, and then received in their spirit as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Now we understand the reason that the Lord is both the Word and the Spirit, and we also understand that God has given us His Son so that we may obtain God and enjoy Him through His Son. In His Son and through His Spirit, God gives Himself to us for our enjoyment. When His Spirit operates in us, He operates through the words in the Bible. Hence, the words in the Bible serve as a guide for the Spirit to open our mind. When our mind is open and when we receive these words into us with our spirit, the Spirit enters into us. When the Spirit enters into us, God and Christ enter into us, because all that is of God is in Christ, and all the riches of Christ are received and declared by the Spirit. Therefore, through the Bible the Spirit reveals all the riches of Christ in us. Through this receiving with our spirit, the words of the Bible are no longer doctrines to us but the reality of the Spirit, the flowing of the Spirit, the passing through of the Spirit, the operation of the Spirit, and the anointing of the Spirit, which is also the supply of the Spirit. When we lead the young people, we must stress this point. Even if we have to repeat it, we should do so, because this point does not exist in man&rsquo;s natural concept and thoughts. If necessary, we should speak it again and again so that as they pursue the Lord in their youth, they will understand the importance of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the past we did not touch the matter of the Spirit in a deep way in our leading of the young people; we also did not explain clearly the key to walking according to the Spirit or following the Spirit. If the Lord is willing, we will speak in detail concerning these things, and I believe that it will render a big help to the brothers and sisters. In this way they will be able to touch the experience of the Spirit step by step and understand what it means to know God in Christ as our life. First Corinthians 6:17 and John 16:15 are two great verses in the Bible. Our speaking cannot exhaust the spiritual matters in these two verses. I hope that all the serving ones will pay attention to the Spirit in their leading. However, we do not have to be anxious or quick. Neither is it necessary for the churches and the young people&rsquo;s meetings to progress uniformly and in the same way. The need of the serving ones to touch the Spirit is more important than speed.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">RELYING ON THE SPIRIT<br />
TO CARRY OUT THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD THROUGH PRAYER</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: June 16, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SPIRIT<br />
IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE GOD</h2>
<p>Throughout the generations, those who have truly known the Lord and touched life have acknowledged that in order to know the Lord we must know life and experience life. However, in order to experience God as life, we must know the Spirit. Regrettably, our knowledge of the Spirit is deficient. Even those who carry out the ministry of the word do not know and speak of the Spirit in a complete or accurate way. There are thousands of books in Christianity, but it is rare to find a message on knowing the Spirit in our experience. However, according to the structure of the Bible, the speaking concerning the Spirit increases as the divine revelation unfolds.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN CONCERNING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Coming as the Spirit</h2>
<p>John 14 marks a turn in the revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s coming in the flesh to His coming as the Spirit. Verses 2 and 3 say, &ldquo;I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; There is much debate in regard to this verse. Some expositors think that <em>coming again</em> refers to the second coming of the Lord Jesus at the end of this age. This is not accurate. <em>Coming again</em> refers to the Lord Jesus coming as the Spirit to enter into the disciples after His resurrection.</p>
<p>Verses 18 and 19 say, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; The time between the Lord&rsquo;s going and His coming is only &ldquo;a little while,&rdquo; and even though the world could not see Him, the Lord promised His disciples that they would see Him. According to these verses, the Lord&rsquo;s going and coming again did not involve centuries or even decades; rather, it was only a matter of three days and three nights, the period after His death and before His resurrection. After His death and resurrection, He came back to be with His disciples. On the evening of His resurrection, the Lord came into the midst of His disciples, and when the disciples saw Him, they rejoiced (20:19-20). This fulfilled the Lord&rsquo;s word in 14:18-19: &ldquo;I am coming to you...The world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me.&rdquo; His coming was His coming as the Spirit (v. 17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Having a Spiritual Body<br />
after His Death and Resurrection</h2>
<p>Some say that on the evening of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus came only with a resurrected body because He allowed one of the disciples to touch the mark of the nails on His hands and put his hand into His side (20:27). Because He came with a resurrected body with flesh and bones, they are unwilling to admit that the Lord Jesus came as the Spirit.</p>
<p>Although He came with a resurrected body, He is the Spirit in resurrection. A brother who could not understand this point once asked me to explain. I replied by asking, &ldquo;Brother, is the Lord Jesus living in you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Of course, He lives in me.&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;Is the Lord Jesus who lives in you the resurrected Lord?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yes, He is the resurrected Lord.&rdquo; Finally I asked, &ldquo;After the Lord Jesus was resurrected, did He have a body with flesh and bones?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;According to Luke 24:39, when the Lord appeared in the midst of the disciples, He had flesh and bones.&rdquo; So I said, &ldquo;Then the Lord Jesus who is in you as the Spirit must have a resurrected body.&rdquo; He had no answer.</p>
<p>On one hand, the Bible clearly says that the Lord Jesus has a resurrected body, but on the other hand, it tells us that the Lord Jesus lives in us as the Spirit. If we consider this matter only with our mind, it is beyond our comprehension. Just because we cannot comprehend something with our mind, however, does not mean that it is not possible. Even with all the theories and proofs that the scientists have concerning the universe, there are numerous unsearchable mysteries about the universe. While we cannot begin to comprehend God, it is even beyond our comprehension to understand the universe created by God. If we would acknowledge that our understanding of such matters is limited, we would be able to declare that the Lord is both the Spirit and has a resurrected body with flesh and bones. The Lord Jesus, who came as the Spirit in John 20, appeared with a resurrected body with flesh and bones. Even though this is beyond our understanding, it does not change the fact that the Lord Jesus came as the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Holy Spirit Breathed<br />
into the Disciples by the Lord<br />
Being the Lord Himself</h2>
<p>In 20:22 the Lord breathed into the disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus was God Himself, and in resurrection He came as the Holy Spirit who could be breathed into the disciples. Before His death and resurrection, He was with His disciples for three and a half years, but He did not speak of His coming as the Spirit until the time immediately before His crucifixion in John 14. Then on the evening of His resurrection, He came into the midst of the disciples, breathed into them, and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The record of this event is very unique.</p>
<p>Immediately prior to His breathing in 20:22, verses 19 and 20 say, &ldquo;When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and while the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you. And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples therefore rejoiced at seeing the Lord.&rdquo; The doors were shut because the disciples were afraid of the Jews, but Jesus still came and stood in their midst. If the doors were shut, how did the Lord Jesus come in? Furthermore, He came with a body of flesh and bones, and He even showed His hands and His side to the disciples. Verse 21 says, &ldquo;Then Jesus said to them again, Peace be to you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&rdquo; Here the expression <em>as...also</em> has a special implication. When the Father sent the Lord, the Father was in the Lord and with the Lord (8:29); then when it was time for the Lord to send the disciples, they were sent in the same way. This means that the Lord was in the disciples and with the disciples. When the Father sent the Lord, the Father was in the Lord and with the Lord. This is the reason that the Lord Jesus could say that the words which He spoke were the works of the Father (14:10). The Lord sent His disciples in the same way that the Father sent the Lord. The Lord sent the disciples by being in them and with them. Hence, when the disciples went out to speak for the Lord, the Lord was in them. The Father sent the Lord and was in the Lord, and the Lord sent the disciples and was in the disciples.</p>
<p>When the Lord breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; the Lord imparted Himself into His disciples. When the Father sent the Lord, He was in the Lord, and before the Lord sent His disciples, He entered into them. The Lord entered into the disciples by breathing into them. The breath breathed into the disciples was the Lord Jesus; it was also the Holy Spirit. When the disciples received this breath, they received the Holy Spirit, and they also received the Lord. This is how the Lord entered into His disciples. In John 20:23 the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you retain, they are retained.&rdquo; This was possible because the disciples&rsquo; forgiveness was really the forgiving of the Lord who was in them. On the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up and preached the gospel to the people of Israel, saying, &ldquo;Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Acts 2:38). Peter could preach the gospel of forgiveness because the Lord who dwelt in Peter was able to forgive. Furthermore, if Peter did not forgive a person&rsquo;s sin, the sin was retained. In Acts 5 Peter said to Ananias and Sapphira that their deceiving of the Holy Spirit was their lying to God, and then they expired (vv. 3-10). Peter&rsquo;s authority was the authority of the Lord who was in him.</p>
<p>In resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit. From John 14 onward, the Lord&rsquo;s speaking concerning His going was in relation to His death, and His speaking concerning His coming was in relation to His resurrection as the Spirit so that He could be in His disciples. Hence, chapter 14 does not speak of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; return at the end of this age. If this were the case, His overall speaking would contradict His words in verses 18 and 19, which say, &ldquo;I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; The coming of the Lord in chapter 14 refers to His coming as the Spirit after His resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELYING ON THE SPIRIT TO WORK FOR GOD</h2>
<p>After the Gospel of John, the record in Acts is entirely a record of the activity of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit in Acts is actually Christ Himself. From Acts until Revelation, the center and subject of the apostles&rsquo; preaching is Christ; however, this Christ is the Spirit. In Acts and in the Epistles, Christ is no longer an objective Lord; He is the Spirit dwelling in us so that we may experience Him subjectively. We can be built up together only in the Holy Spirit. If we are not in the Holy Spirit, we can never be built up together. If we do not bring people into the Holy Spirit, we are not building up the church. In the same principle, we must be in the Holy Spirit when we lead people to experience Christ as life.</p>
<p>We have to acknowledge that we have had very little results from our gospel preaching, from our messages, and from our study of the Bible. Many people have heard our preaching of the gospel, but how much effect has there been? The reason that our work lacks results is that we are not in the Spirit. When five hundred people hear the gospel, perhaps two hundred give us their name, but only seventy are baptized. Of the seventy who are baptized, at most twenty remain. Then if we consider these twenty, we have to admit that not many of them are truly living or even know how to pray. The power of our gospel is weak because our spirit is weak and because we have not brought people into the Spirit in a genuine way. We must have a turn; we must turn from relying on messages to relying on the Spirit. Our message must match the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARRYING OUT THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD<br />
BY PRAYER</h2>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, three thousand people were saved as soon as the apostles stood up to preach the gospel (Acts 2:14, 41). The apostles relied on the Spirit of God (v. 4), not on their ability. We should rely on the Spirit in the same way. Our preaching of the word should be in coordination with the Spirit, but our actual situation is just the opposite; that is, we rely on our preaching and expect the Spirit to coordinate with us. This is the reason that there has been very little result in our work; this is also the reason for our deadened condition. As serving ones, we have prayed much with fasting. Serving ones need to pray in order to touch the Spirit, not for things. I hope that we would all pray in order to touch the Spirit and gain more of Him. Only in this way will our preaching have impact.</p>
<p>The word we preach must be living, just like the preaching of the apostles on the day of Pentecost. The apostles said, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (6:4). They carried out the ministry of the word through prayer; that is, the ministry of the word came out of their prayer. They prayed, and they received the word. Continuing steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word was the way of the apostles&rsquo; work. Our work should also come out of prayer and bring people into prayer. Both those who preach the word and those who receive the word should be ones who pray. The one who is speaking needs to pray, and those who hear should also pray. Then everything that we do will be in the Spirit. The book of Acts shows that the saints prayed day by day. Although the apostles did not cease from preaching the word, their preaching was in coordination with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Our problem today is that we are short of the Spirit, and the main reason for this shortage is our lack of prayer. We can give a thousand messages, but they will be useless without the Spirit. Any message that does not match the Spirit or does not have the Spirit is useless. People cannot be saved without being brought into the Spirit. The number and the content of our messages mean nothing if we do not bring people into the Spirit. No matter how much light is in our word, it will be useless and ineffectual without the coordination of the Spirit. All the leading ones must wake up. We cannot rely on the preaching of the word while neglecting the Spirit. The young people&rsquo;s meeting must have a turn in this direction: we must turn to prayer. Those who are in the ministry of the word must pray; the elders and the serving ones need to pray more and more.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
TO EXERCISE THEIR SPIRIT TO PRAY USING THE WORDS OF THE SCRIPTURES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: July 21, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Scriptures Supplying Us<br />
with the Food of Life</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning how to turn our reading of the Scriptures into prayer so that we may help the young people to use their spirit to pray and touch the Lord. Even though the Bible contains teachings, we should explain to the young people that the purpose of the Bible is not to give us teachings but to supply us with food. The Bible is more than teachings; its teachings are merely a means to supply our spirit with God&rsquo;s word as food in order for us to be nourished with life.</p>
<p>We need to be rescued from the natural concept that a book is an instrument of teaching to convey knowledge. On the surface, the Bible is a book like any other book in the world, with black letters printed on white paper. Hence, when a person receives a Bible, he often regards the Bible as if it were the same as any other book that can impart some knowledge. Many Christians have this concept. However, we must show the young people that the Bible is different from any other book. The Bible is not a book that contains merely teachings. Rather, the Bible supplies us with spiritual nourishment by means of its teachings. Hence, when we stress the matter of reading the Bible, we should not emphasize the matter of receiving teachings but the matter of receiving spiritual nourishment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Scriptures Supplying Us with Christ</h2>
<p>We should explain that the nourishment we receive from the Scriptures is not food for the soul. Newspapers, magazines, novels, or scientific studies provide food for the soul or for the mind because these printed materials convey knowledge and theories about the world. In contrast, the Bible supplies us with Christ, the Lord Himself. We should read the Bible in order to receive spiritual nourishment related to life. This means that when we read the Bible, we should receive the Triune God. The Triune God&mdash;the Father in the Son as the Spirit&mdash;is embodied in the words of the Bible. Hence, when we contact the Bible, we need to read the Bible with prayer so that we may receive spiritual food by touching Christ and receiving the Lord Jesus in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Teachings in the Scriptures<br />
Being Centered on Christ</h2>
<p>When we speak of touching the Lord as we read the Bible, some may say that this is not possible, because there are many portions in the Scriptures that do not contain teachings related to Christ. For example, 2 Corinthians 6:14 says, &ldquo;Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers,&rdquo; which concerns marriage and friendship. Such a word seems to be unrelated to Christ. The Bible also speaks of diligence in Romans 12:8 and in 2 Peter 1:5 and 10, which again seems unrelated to Christ. It is possible to cite numerous examples in the Bible that do not appear to be related to Christ on the surface. However, we must realize that Christ is the center of the Bible; all the words in the Bible take Christ as the center and extend outward to the circumference of every matter. If our thought in reading the Bible is limited to merely receiving teachings, we will not touch Christ or see the relationship between teachings and Christ.</p>
<p>When we read the Scriptures, we should take Christ as the center in order to see the connection between a teaching and Christ. Christ can be compared to the hub of a wheel. Many spokes spread out from the hub of a wheel to the rim of the wheel, forming a complete wheel. The truths in the Bible should be considered from the standpoint of a complete wheel, that is, Christ being the center of the wheel and all the teachings coming out of Him as spokes and being related to Him as the rim. Some teachings are directly related to Christ, and others are indirectly related; however, all are connected to Him. If we have such a concept, we will discover the proper place for each teaching in its relation to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Teachings in the Scriptures Keeping People<br />
in the Experience and Enjoyment of Christ</h2>
<p>If we read the Scriptures with the intention of touching Christ and contacting Christ, we will receive the Lord as our food. Thus, when we read 2 Corinthians 6:14, which says, &ldquo;Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers,&rdquo; we will clearly realize that believers and unbelievers should not have intimate friendships or be dissimilarly yoked in marriage, because this will hinder us from experiencing Christ. When a believer marries an unbeliever, it will not be a help to the believer in gaining more of the Lord; rather, it will hinder his experience. Hence, a believer not being dissimilarly yoked with an unbeliever will keep the believer in the best possible condition to experience and enjoy Christ.</p>
<p>It is in this regard that the Bible speaks of virtues such as diligence and prudence. A slothful person will miss numerous opportunities to experience Christ, and a careless and sloppy person will not be able to grasp many opportunities to experience Christ. A person who experiences Christ must be diligent, quiet, careful, and prudent. This does not mean, however, that a person who has these qualities will experience Christ automatically. It only means that a person who does not have these qualities will have great difficulty in experiencing Christ. If we read the Bible in this way, we will realize that it contains many teachings that will keep us in a condition to experience Christ.</p>
<p>If we desire to remain in a condition that is most favorable to experiencing Christ, we need to receive the teachings in the Scriptures. If we go against these teachings, we will not be protected, restricted, or regulated. As a result, we will lose our ground to experience Christ. The Bible contains many teachings that serve to protect, restrict, and regulate us to keep us on the proper ground for the experience and enjoyment of Christ. If we touch the Bible in this way, the connection between these teachings and Christ will gradually become clear. For example, we may read 1 Corinthians 1:2, which speaks of Jesus Christ as being &ldquo;theirs and ours.&rdquo; This word means that Christ is the portion of all the believers. Verse 30 continues, saying, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; This shows that all the teachings in 1 Corinthians are related to the believers&rsquo; being in Christ. We can connect all the teachings in the Bible directly or indirectly to Christ because He is the center of the Bible.</p>
<p>Since the Bible is not merely a book of teachings, receiving teachings from it should not be our first consideration. Rather, we should read the Bible by praying over it to absorb the Lord. The Bible is a book that supplies life; the Bible is the bread of life. When we read the Bible, we should receive a supply of life from it. This supply of life is Christ Himself. Although there are many items in the Bible that do not speak directly about Christ, they keep us, restrict us, and put us in a position to experience Christ and turn our being toward Him. Hence, all the teachings in the Bible are related directly or indirectly to Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL EXERCISE OF PRAYING<br />
OVER THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Giving Priority to Prayer<br />
rather than to Exposition and Study</h2>
<p>Now we must speak concerning the practical exercise of coming to the Scriptures in prayer. When we come to the Scriptures, rather than giving priority to expounding or studying the Scriptures, we should pray using the words of the Scriptures in order to open up the Bible. This kind of reading does not emphasize studying or even discussion and fellowship. Rather, it emphasizes the absorption of the spiritual content of the Scriptures. With this kind of reading, exposition and discussion is not critical.</p>
<p>If there is a sense while we are reading that some point should be expressed, it is best to express it through prayer. For example, if four brothers are reading the Bible together, a brother who has a certain sense about a verse should express it through prayer. When he prays in this way, another brother may receive some inspiration, which he, in turn, can express through prayer. In this way the meaning of a portion of the Bible will become even clearer than if he tried to express the meaning through explanatory words. We will also gain more than a mental understanding of the Word; instead, the words that we read will become a supply in our spirit. When we read the Word, we should emphasize prayer much more than just explanation and discussion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Praying over Too Many Verses</h2>
<p>Second, when we use the Scriptures to pray, we should not use too many verses. It is difficult to absorb many verses. This is like trying to eat a meal when there is too much food on the table; it is easy to be distracted by the choices, and it also causes those who are eating to not fully taste or appreciate the food. It also encourages one to take big bites or to eat too quickly so that the food is not digested properly. The amount of food is not important; rather, eating in the proper way is important. Likewise, when we pray over the Bible, there are certain skills that we need to learn. Sometimes we may need to read through an entire section of verses and then pray over a few verses within the section. For example, if we read only two or three verses of the genealogy in Matthew 1, we may feel very dry. It would be better to read through the entire genealogy and then select a small section to pray over. This requires discernment, because in other sections the verses are so rich that it is enough to read and pray over just one verse.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pointing Out the Crucial Points</h2>
<p>It is best if a serving one can give a little explanation of the verses that the young people will pray over. This is not a matter of giving a long exposition or message; a brief point or two will be sufficient. For example, if the selected verse is John 1:1, it is enough to point out that the Word was in the beginning, that the Word is the Lord Himself, and that all things came into being through the Lord as the Word. We can also point out that in the Lord is life and that this life is the light that shines in us. It is sufficient to point out these crucial points.</p>
<p>Concerning the genealogy in Matthew 1, we can point out that the Lord Jesus is the son of David and the son of Abraham and that there are forty-two generations from Abraham to Christ in the genealogy. The first section is from Abraham to David, the next section is the genealogy of the kings from David until the time of captivity, and the last section is of the forefathers who lost the kingdom from the time of captivity until Mary&rsquo;s husband, Joseph. Perhaps the serving one can point out that this genealogy mentions five women. Among them, only Mary was a chaste virgin, while the other four were not so good. These four were Tamar, the daughter-in-law of Judah; Rahab, the wife of Salmon; Ruth, the wife of Boaz; and Bathsheba, whom David married and who had been the wife of Uriah the Hittite. We can also point out the reason that the Lord Jesus is called the son of Abraham and the son of David. Abraham is the father of faith, whereas David is the beginning of the generations of the kings. On one hand, the Lord Jesus is the son of Abraham, typified by Isaac; on the other hand, He is the son of David, typified by Solomon. In short, the entire genealogy shows that the Lord Jesus is God coming to be a descendant of man. Furthermore, He is the One who receives the inheritance as well as inherits the throne. The son of Abraham receives the inheritance, whereas the son of David inherits the throne. It is good enough if these crucial points are mentioned briefly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading the Young People to Pray</h2>
<p>We must lead the young people to pray. In the past when we asked them to pray, they would say that they did not know what words to pray or that they did not have any feeling to pray. Now that we are practicing praying the Word, there are no excuses because they do not have to compose any prayer. Instead, they can simply pray according to the words in the Bible. For example, using John 1:1, someone can pray, &ldquo;Lord, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; He can use the verse as his prayer, or he can change the wording a little. The excuse of having no feeling to pray has also been solved because as soon as we pray with the words from the Bible, we are full of feeling. We can say, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was You.&rdquo; Sometimes when we just read the Bible, we may not have any feeling, but when we pray using the Scriptures, we receive a supply in our spirit. When we pray according to the words in the Bible, there are words in our spirit that are full of feeling. Thus, it is easy to pray, saying, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Word of God. You explain God to us, and You also speak to us from within all the time.&rdquo; This kind of spontaneous speaking to the Lord is not difficult at all.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Praying over Too Many Points</h2>
<p>When we lead people to pray, we should teach them not to pray over too many points. Each person should pray one point. Occasionally, someone may pray concerning two points but no more than what is needed. No one should attempt to cover all the points in his prayer. For example, John 1:1-4 has several crucial points: &ldquo;in the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Word was with God,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Word was God,&rdquo; &ldquo;all things came into being through Him,&rdquo; &ldquo;in Him was life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the life was the light of men.&rdquo; A person does not need to cover all these points in one prayer. It is best to pray over one point or, at most, two points. We should cover one point in our prayer and then let others have the opportunity to pray. When we all pray one point, all the points will be covered by all the saints. However, if someone still has some feeling, he can pray again.</p>
<p>When we take turns to pray in this way, our spirit will have instant feeling. Some feelings may come directly, and other feelings may come from hearing the prayers of the other saints. Some feelings arise out of a sense of mutual inspiration. As a result of such prayers, a portion of the Bible will be thoroughly opened and imparted into the young people. Furthermore, all the young people will be exercised in their spirit and supplied with spiritual food. This kind of supply from the Bible contains Christ Himself. We must explain these matters to the young people and lead them into this practical exercise.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING IN SPIRITUAL LIFE&mdash;<br />
KNOWING THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: August 25, 1961</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to speak about leading the young people in matters related to spiritual life. The practical experience of life is related to the cross, and it involves primarily accepting the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THAT IS OF MAN NEEDING<br />
TO BE TERMINATED BEFORE GOD</h2>
<p>The most important meaning of the cross is termination. We must stress the point to the young people that in the eyes of God, everything of man must be terminated. This includes not only the evil things but also the good things in man. Whatever comes out of man must be terminated. A Christian&rsquo;s experience of life is entirely different from the world&rsquo;s cultivation of ethics. Ethical cultivation tries to nurture the element of good within man and to restrict the element of evil in him. A Christian&rsquo;s experience of life, or we may say a Christian&rsquo;s practical living, is totally different. The practical living of a Christian is to live Christ. The experience of the life of a Christian is to experience Christ. Hence, in order for us to experience Christ, we must be terminated. As long as anything of ourselves remains, Christ cannot be expressed through us. In order to live out Christ, we must be terminated. Hence, Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.&rdquo; We are crucified, terminated, and it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us. When it is no longer we who live, Christ can live out of us. This word shows that the practical living of a Christian involves Christ living His life in us, not us living our life. In order for Christ to live in us, we must be terminated; thankfully, we have already been terminated through our crucifixion with Christ.</p>
<p>There are several portions in the New Testament that clearly refer to the matter of our termination. In addition to Galatians 2:20, Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ. Therefore, we must see that we have been terminated before God. Both what is good and what is evil in us have been terminated; not only the aspect of our nature that commits sin but also the aspect of our nature that desires to do good deeds have been terminated; not only our hatred but also our love have been terminated; not only our pride but also our humility have been terminated. Now all that we are and all that we have must be crucified in our experience because everything has been crucified with Christ in reality.</p>
<p>Most Christians, especially the young people, know little of this matter; hence, the more we stress this point, the better it will be for them. The matter we should stress is that in order to have the reality of the Christian life, we must accept the cross. In order to accept the cross, however, we must realize that all we are and all we have must be terminated and that this is possible because God has already terminated us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE CROSS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Work of the First Ministry<br />
in the New Testament&mdash;<br />
Burying People</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the New Testament, John the Baptist was sent by God to lead people to repent (Matt. 3:1-2). When people went to John and expressed their desire to repent, he buried them in water (vv. 6, 11). In order to enter into the reality of the New Testament, people must have a new beginning by being terminated and buried so that they can receive Christ as life and live Christ. Hence, the work of the first ministry by the first servant sent by God in the New Testament was to bury people. The work of John the Baptist was to bury people. John&rsquo;s baptism was equivalent to a burial. When people went to John, they had to confess that they were sinners, and then they needed to be terminated. John led them to repent, and then he buried them; that is, he terminated them. He had to terminate and bury them because they needed a new beginning in Christ. They needed to receive Christ as their life so that Christ could live out from them. Anyone who desires to partake of the grace, life, and blessings of the New Testament must be completely terminated and buried.</p>
<h2 class="head2">After Believing into the Lord,<br />
Man Needing to Be Baptized</h2>
<p>After believing, the first thing one should do as a Christian is to be baptized (28:19). To be baptized is to be buried. After a person believes into the Lord, he should let God do everything, and the first thing that God will do is to ask the church to bury, to put an end, to the believer. In order to live the life of a Christian, one must stand in the position of baptism, that is, in the position of one who has died, been buried, and then been raised up.</p><h2 class="head2">God Terminating Us in Christ</h2>
<p>God crucified and terminated us in Christ. When Christ was on the cross suffering God&rsquo;s judgment, we were judged in Him. In other words, God&rsquo;s judgment on Christ was also His judgment on us because He bore our sins in His body on the tree (1 Pet. 2:24). When Christ died on the cross under God&rsquo;s judgment, we were included in Him. He died, and we also died in Him. The most obvious type concerning this is the ark in the Old Testament (Gen. 6:14-21), which carried eight people in Noah&rsquo;s household through the water of death. The ark is a type of Christ, and Noah and his family typify all the believers who were redeemed in Christ. When the ark passed through the water of death, everything inside the ark also passed through the death water. Similarly, because we were in Christ, we experienced death together with Him. When Christ died, we died in Him. In Christ, God terminated us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Death Being the Most Wonderful Way<br />
of Salvation</h2>
<p>Death is God&rsquo;s wonderful way of salvation. Through death God terminated us. For sinners death brings in God&rsquo;s punishment, but for believers death brings in God&rsquo;s salvation in Christ. Apart from Christ, death is a punishment for sinners, but in Christ, death is a salvation for believers. God uses death to save sinners. In His wonderful way of salvation, God terminates everything by death. The experience of Christ is available to whomever allows himself to be terminated by death. Although we often say that God&rsquo;s salvation is a salvation of life, we must realize that this refers to the second aspect of salvation. The first aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation is death, that is, God&rsquo;s termination of us by death. Then after death God enlivens us. Hence, anyone who is not terminated by God cannot enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>In order for us to have experiences of life and to have the practical living of a Christian, we must see our need for termination and also see that we have been terminated already with Christ on the cross. When we believe into Him and are baptized, we are acknowledging the fact that we have been terminated, that we are those who have been put into death. As such, we can stand on the ground of our death with Christ as the basis for our Christian living and experience. We are dead, and we have been terminated. This is the basis for our living and our experience of life. We are dead in regard to everything, including our relatives, friends, things, and even events. The basis of our living is death; we have died in Christ on the cross. The basis of our dealing with people, things, and events is that we have died. This is the way of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>The Lord said that we should take up the cross and follow Him (Matt. 16:24). This does not refer to suffering, as most people think; rather, it speaks of following the Lord through the death of the cross. By remaining in the death of the cross, we can genuinely forsake everything and follow the Lord. This does not mean that when we forsake everything, we no longer do anything. This is not what forsaking everything means. Forsaking everything means that although we are studying, we are studying in the place of death. Likewise, forsaking everything does not mean that we cease to be a teacher. Rather, we continue to teach, but while we are teaching, we are in the place of death. It is the same with being a parent, child, or spouse. We are dead people studying; we are dead people teaching; we are dead people being parents, being children, and being spouses. In dealing with all persons, things, and events, we are dead to all that we are and all that we have so that Christ can be expressed through us. This is what it means to take up the cross and follow the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING IN SPIRITUAL LIFE&mdash;<br />
THE APPLICATION OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: September 1, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS PUTTING PEOPLE<br />
IN THE PLACE OF DEATH</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the cross and the application of the cross. When we speak of the cross, we must be clear about God&rsquo;s intention related to the cross, because only then can we lead others to have a proper knowledge of the cross. In order to experience the cross, we must have a proper and genuine understanding of it. The cross is what God wants in man; He wants all that is of man to be put to death.</p>
<p>All God&rsquo;s purpose for man and all His work related to man are to bring man to the place of death. God fulfilled this purpose through the work that He accomplished on the cross at Golgotha, where He not only dealt with man&rsquo;s sins but also dealt with man himself. At the cross, at this point in the history of the universe, God dealt with man&rsquo;s sins, and He also dealt with man. Both man&rsquo;s sins and man himself were dealt with by the Lord Jesus when He was nailed on the cross at Golgotha. God wanted man to die, and God brought man to the place of death. God&rsquo;s purpose is for man to die, and God put man into such a place at the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PATTERN OF JESUS</h2>
<p>The age of the New Testament began with termination brought in by John the Baptist, and the life of a Christian also begins with termination. When a Christian is baptized after believing, he is put into a place of death. This is how the New Testament age began, and this is how the Christian life begins. Death also marked the beginning of the ministry of Jesus. When the Lord Jesus was ready to carry out His ministry and serve God, He went to the river Jordan to be baptized before preaching any message and doing any work. The humanity that the Lord Jesus put on in His incarnation was buried in the water by John the Baptist. If the Lord Jesus were only God but not also a man, there would have been no need for Him to pass through death by going into the water. However, Jesus was a man, and as such, He needed to die; He needed to be buried.</p>
<p>Without Jesus&rsquo; being put into the place of death, the God who indwelt Him could not have been lived out through Him. On the first day of the Lord&rsquo;s work, He delivered Himself to John the Baptist to be buried in the place of death. From that day onward, He continuously remained in the position of death. This enabled Him to truthfully say, &ldquo;The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing&rdquo; (John 5:19). He also said, &ldquo;I am in the Father and the Father is in Me...The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works&rdquo; (14:10). Because the Father was in Him, He had to die; only then could the Father do His works in Him. If the Lord still lived, the Father would not have been able to do His works in Him. He died so that the Father could live; the Lord remained in the place of death so that the Father could do His works from within Him. The Lord not only worked in this way; He also spoke in this way. He did not do anything or speak anything from Himself. When He spoke, it was the Father who did His works. When the Lord Jesus spoke and preached the word, it was the Father who was speaking and working in Him because He had been buried in the river Jordan. In His ministry of three and a half years and throughout His entire life, the Lord remained in the place of death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S LIFE NEEDING TO DIE SO THAT<br />
GOD&rsquo;S LIFE CAN LIVE</h2>
<p>If the Lord Jesus had only one life, His death would have had no meaning. If He only had the human life, His death would have been the same as any other man. If He only had the divine life, He would have been unable to die, because God&rsquo;s life is eternal. But the Lord Jesus had two lives, the human life and the divine life. His human life needed to die so that the source of His living would be God&rsquo;s life. Thus, even though His human life was terminated as the source of His living, He still lived because He had another life, God&rsquo;s life. Because He had two lives, one life could die so that the other life could be lived out. Even though He lived in the place of death in regard to His human life, He was able to live because He had the divine life.</p>
<p>The life that needs to die is our human life, whereas the life that needs to be lived out is God&rsquo;s life. The need for man&rsquo;s life to be terminated is not related to its being evil or corrupt. In the human life of Jesus the Nazarene, there was no corruption or evil, but His human life needed to die so that it would not be the source for His living. Only God&rsquo;s life must be the source of our living. The human life of a man needs to be terminated in order for God&rsquo;s life to be lived out. If our human life is not terminated, God&rsquo;s divine life cannot be lived out of us. Hence, our need for termination is not related to corruption. Even if our humanity were not corrupt or evil, it would still need to be terminated in order for God&rsquo;s life to have the first place in all the things related to our human living. Man&rsquo;s life must yield to God&rsquo;s life; man&rsquo;s life needs to be removed by death so that God&rsquo;s life can be our source.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING TO ENTER INTO MAN<br />
TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>Death is part of God&rsquo;s plan because His heart&rsquo;s desire is to enter into man and be man&rsquo;s life. This is His eternal purpose and plan. God&rsquo;s plan is very profound. He created a man with a mind, emotion, and will. However, God wants man to receive His life so that His life becomes the source of man&rsquo;s innate abilities. Once man receives God&rsquo;s life, God wants man to yield the source of his living to the operation of His life. This yielding implies death, that is, the termination of man&rsquo;s life as his source so that God&rsquo;s life may become the source of his living. God&rsquo;s plan is not focused on man doing something for God out from his life but on His entering into man so that His life may be lived out of man.</p>
<p>This is the reason that man needs to be terminated and to pass through death. However, in order for man to be terminated and to pass through death, he must have two lives. If a man has only the human life, he will not pass through death when he dies. For example, the famous Chinese philosopher Wang Yang-ming had only one life, and Socrates also had only one life. Wang Yang-ming lived out only the life of Wang Yang-ming, and Socrates lived out only the life of Socrates. Since they had only the human life, their death was an end with no further significance. However, Christ&rsquo;s human life could be terminated because He had another life, God&rsquo;s life. His human life needed to be terminated so that God&rsquo;s life could be lived out. The termination of His human life enabled the divine life to be lived out.</p>
<p>Just as Christ needed to die, Christians need to die. Today we have two lives, the human life and the divine life. These two lives cannot be lived out concurrently; one of them must die. In order for God&rsquo;s life to live, man&rsquo;s life must die. Nevertheless, we must realize that even though man&rsquo;s human life is terminated, he can still live by the divine life. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; Paul was crucified with Christ, and it was no longer he who lived. However, he still lived because he had another life. God does not want us to be good and meek or to love others by living out these virtues from our human life; God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire is for man to die so that all that is expressed in our living comes out of His life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE CROSS NOT BEING A SUFFERING<br />
BUT AN ACCEPTING OF DEATH</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus began to fulfill His ministry, He first was baptized; that is, He was put in the place of death. This was His bearing of the cross. Many Christians have a wrong understanding of the cross; they think that bearing the cross means to suffer. Actually, this is a wrong concept. Bearing the cross means to stand in the place of death, to accept death. Even though death can involve suffering, suffering is not necessarily equivalent to death. If we think that the cross is related only to suffering, this concept is not accurate. In the Bible the real meaning of the cross is that it leads people to the place of death. Although crucifixion is not without suffering, the purpose of crucifixion is not suffering but death. The cross is not a place of torture; it is only a place of death. Many Christians, who focus on the cross as a place of pain, are influenced by asceticism, but they do not see that the stress of the cross is not on pain and suffering but on death. Bearing the cross is not mainly related to pain and suffering but to accepting death and standing in the place of death.</p>
<p>For example, a young brother, who has a desire to serve the Lord, may give up his pursuit of a Ph.D. and even forsake the enjoyment of the world. In his being he may truly desire to live a suffering life, but is he bearing the cross? This is not a certainty, even if he suffers. If, while he is serving, he is self-centered and has a bad temper and a strong personality, is he bearing the cross? Rather than bearing the cross, he is simply being a martyr. Many revolutionaries and statesmen have such a thought; they are willing to sacrifice their lives in order to accomplish something related to their idealism and ideology. Similarly, it is possible for some believers to forsake their future and lose everything that they have for the sake of Christ but still not necessarily bear the cross. There may be sacrifice and suffering but not the bearing of the cross. Bearing the cross means to stand in the place of death and to accept death.</p>
<p>If people can see only suffering in a person&rsquo;s work for the Lord, his work will not have much value. If, however, people can see a person who is standing in the place of death, his work will be valuable. When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, people did not see a person who was merely suffering; rather, they saw a person who was dead. The Lord said, &ldquo;The Son can do nothing from Himself&rdquo; (John 5:19). He was dead to Himself. In all His living and work, the Father who dwelt in Him was doing His works. This was also the case with the apostle Paul. Some people think of Paul merely as one who sacrificed everything for the Lord, passing through all kinds of sufferings and afflictions, and eventually being martyred. Actually, Paul was a person who bore the cross, a person who accepted death.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus bore the cross all His life, and at the end of His life He was actually nailed to a cross. With us, we begin our life as a Christian by being crucified with Him. From the moment we receive Him, we are crucified with Him, and then we must begin to bear the cross. The Lord first bore the cross and then was crucified; with us, we first must be crucified and then bear the cross. The Lord bore the cross and then died on the cross; we first must be crucified on the cross and then walk on the way of the cross. Bearing the cross means to stand and remain in the place of death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING THE CROSS</h2>
<p>When we see these points, the cross will become a test in our daily life. For example, when we go to have fellowship with a brother, we must first ask, &ldquo;Am I in the place of death? Am I a person who has died on the cross? Have I passed through the death of the cross for this fellowship? Have I passed through the death of the cross, and am I remaining in this death?&rdquo; With this kind of consideration, it will not be difficult to discover whether our fellowship is out from the Lord&rsquo;s life or our life. When we are about to speak with another person, whether it is to praise him or to rebuke him, or even to speak concerning our situation, we should test and see if we have passed through the death of the cross and are remaining in the place of death. Such a consideration will open the way for the Lord to enlighten us about our true condition.</p>
<p>When we are seeking the Lord&rsquo;s will, we should check to see if we have passed through the cross and are standing in the place of death. If we ask in this way, we will know our true condition in regard to our seeking. God&rsquo;s will can be made known only to those who are on the cross and remain in the place of death. Those who have not passed through the death of the cross do not have a way to know God&rsquo;s will. This is a principle that we can use to test every matter, whether great or small. When we are going to buy a garment or anything else, we should ask, &ldquo;Have I passed through the cross? Am I in the death of the cross?&rdquo; When we make contact with others and even when we negotiate with others, are we standing in the place of death? Have we passed through the cross? When we ask in this way, we will know whether or not we are standing in the place of death. Even when we give a message or lead others, we must ask, &ldquo;Am I standing in the place of death? Have I passed through death?&rdquo; This will deliver us not only from sin and the world but also from our natural human life, and not only from evil but also from any form of goodness that does not come from God.</p>
<p>This word may sound simple, but it is not easy to receive. By testing we can know whether or not we are in the place of death and can receive the cross. If we insist on doing things according to our desire, God will raise up an environment and show us the cross in this environment. Whether we are willing or not, God is always working to put us into the place of death, allowing the cross in our environment to deal with us. Such an operation is not based on our willingness but on His will that He would be lived out through us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>

THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h1>

<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED WITH THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>All Bible students acknowledge that Colossians and Ephesians are sister books because they have many similar utterances. For example, Colossians 3:16-17 speaks of giving thanks and praise when we are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, and Ephesians 5:18-20 speaks of giving thanks and praise when we are filled with the Holy Spirit. These two portions refer to two aspects of one thing. If we want to be filled with praise and thanksgiving, we must be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word as well as with the Spirit. Moreover, if we compare these two portions, we will understand that the Lord&rsquo;s word is the Spirit. When we are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, we are filled with the Spirit. In order to be filled with the Spirit, we first must be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, because the Lord&rsquo;s word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>Nutritionists tell us that food contains energy that can be measured in calories. Every day we need to consume many calories; hence, we must eat well in order to absorb energy from our food. Speaking on the podium consumes much energy because energy is required for the exercise of the spirit and the cooperation of the physical body. Hence, whenever I give a message, I need to eat food in order to have the energy to speak. The Lord&rsquo;s word can be compared to food, and the Spirit can be likened to the energy in the food. If we want to be full of energy, we must take in a sufficient amount of food. Similarly, if we want to be filled with the Spirit, we must be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>I believe this is what Paul had in mind when he spoke of the Lord&rsquo;s word and the Spirit in Colossians and Ephesians. Both the word and the Spirit are indispensable. The Spirit depends on the Lord&rsquo;s word, and the Lord&rsquo;s word depends on the Spirit. A believer should pay attention to the Scriptures without and to the Holy Spirit within. Thank God that we have the Bible in our hand and the Holy Spirit in our spirit. This is very precious. In order to learn to take God as life, we need to know how to deal with the Bible and how to deal with the Holy Spirit. Both the Bible and the Spirit are indispensable.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many believers do not take care of both aspects equally. Some emphasize the Bible to the neglect of the Spirit. They use their mind to study the Bible, read the Bible, and memorize the Bible. As a result, the Bible becomes dead letter to them. It is not wrong to diligently read the Bible, but if we neglect the Spirit, the letter will quickly deaden us. Others emphasize the Spirit to the neglect of the Bible. Although they believe that the Bible is God&rsquo;s Word, they rarely read it, and when they read it, they do not comprehend or understand it. Instead, they focus on spiritual practices, such as praying. When they pray, they are full of Hallelujahs and touch a sweet inner feeling that seems to give them a sense of living in heaven. However, when we speak of reading the Bible, they say, &ldquo;The words in the Bible are dead letters. What good is there to read it? It is sufficient to pray. All our problems are solved when we pray and are filled with the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; While we should pray and be filled with the Holy Spirit, the consequences of neglecting the Bible can be dangerous. Such a condition can be likened to a train with a boiling steam engine but with no train tracks to direct its motion. This is a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Once some people came to debate with us, saying, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit in us will never lead us in a wrong way. As long as we have the Holy Spirit living in us, this is enough. We do not have to pay attention to the dead letter.&rdquo; These people were very insistent concerning their views, but within a few years they fell into serious errors.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to pay attention only to the Spirit but neglect the Bible. We must pay equal attention to the Bible in our hand and to the Spirit within us. When the children of Israel journeyed in the wilderness, they were led by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire during the night (Exo. 13:21-22). Actually, the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire were the same leading of God. During the day this leading appeared as a pillar of cloud, and during the night it appeared as a pillar of fire. The Old Testament clearly reveals that God was present in both the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire. God Himself is in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire. The cloud typifies the Spirit, and the enlightening fire typifies the Bible. Just as God led the children of Israel in the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire as they journeyed in the wilderness, He leads us in the Spirit and in the Word. This is a very good type. When our condition is as bright as the day, we have the clear leading of the Spirit within us. When our condition is darker and we cannot touch the sense of the Spirit within us, we should follow the pillar of fire, the Bible. I hope that we all would follow the Lord by reading and meditating on the Bible diligently every day and by following the Holy Spirit within us moment by moment.</p>
<p>A normal Christian should have a normal relationship with both the Word and the Spirit. Whenever our being does not correspond with the Word, something is wrong. Similarly, whenever our being does not correspond with the Spirit, something is wrong. In order to be a proper Christian, our being must correspond to the Word without and to the Spirit within.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR BEING CORRESPONDING TO<br />
THE WORDS IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>We can illustrate the need for our being to correspond to the Bible with the matter of repenting and believing in the Lord. The Bible says that we should repent and believe into the Lord (Acts 20:21; John 3:16). If we read the Bible but do not have a daily experience of repenting and believing into the Lord, our being will not correspond to the words in the Bible. Thank the Lord that we are in accord with the Bible on this point.</p>
<p>In addition to the Bible speaking of repenting and believing into the Lord, it also says, &ldquo;He who believes has eternal life&rdquo; (6:47). Furthermore, the Bible says, &ldquo;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God&rdquo; (1 John 5:13). We need to ask ourselves whether or not we are experiencing eternal life. I believe that many of us would respond that we have eternal life because God is in us. But how can we know that God is in us? We can know because there is a sense of joy and satisfaction in our inner being, but if this sense of peace is lacking for any reason, we will not be able to see the pillar of cloud clearly. Even if our inner being becomes darkened so that we cannot clearly see the pillar of cloud, we should remember that we also have a pillar of fire. When we do not have a clear inner sense and it seems as if the Spirit is not present, we should not forget that we still have the Bible. The Bible says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes...would have eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:16). This is the Word of God. Although we may feel dark within, even to the point that we have no sense of God within us as life, the Word still says that those who have believed into the Son of God have eternal life. If God says this, it is so. This is the Word, like the pillar of fire, shining in a dark night to enable us to go forward on our path.</p>
<p>We know that a ten-dollar bill is worth ten dollars because we can plainly see the words <em>ten dollars.</em> The Bible is God&rsquo;s unlimited treasure house, and the value of its content is real and can be received by us, just as we can receive ten dollars worth of goods when we have a ten-dollar bill. If we do not know the words in the Bible, we will suffer a big loss. This would be like using a ten-dollar bill to receive only five dollars worth of goods. This would be quite regrettable.</p>
<p>In order to know the Bible, we should read it every day and even memorize it. The more we memorize, the better it will be. We should memorize not only John 3:16 but also the Lord&rsquo;s words in verses 14 and 15: &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; We know that we have eternal life because the Lord said, &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; Since we have believed, we have eternal life. If a person who has believed into Him says that he does not have eternal life based on his feelings alone, he is calling the Lord a liar. Who is more reliable&mdash;the Lord who says that everyone who believes may have eternal life or the person who says that he does not have eternal life based on his feelings? We should believe the Lord&rsquo;s word; otherwise, we are treating Him as if He were a liar.</p>
<p>It does not require much effort to have a proper regard for the Bible. It is enough to simply acknowledge what the Bible says. When the Bible says that we should repent, we should acknowledge this and repent. When it speaks of believing into the Lord, we should simply believe and receive. When it speaks of having eternal life, we should say, &ldquo;Amen. Praise the Lord! We have believed, and we have eternal life.&rdquo; We know these things because they are spoken of in the Bible. Some may say, &ldquo;Even though the Bible says that I have eternal life, I do not feel as if I have eternal life. What should I do?&rdquo; To those who ask such a question, we should respond, &ldquo;Your feelings do not matter, and they cannot change the truth in the Bible.&rdquo; When I am speaking, I concentrate my whole being on my speaking, and therefore, I do not necessarily feel a ten-dollar bill in my pocket, but it is still there. Our feelings are not reliable. Sometimes we may feel that we have a one-hundred-dollar bill in our pocket but realize that it has been stolen only when we reach into the pocket.</p>
<p>It is not our feelings that matter but the facts in the Bible that matter. The Bible says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; Since we are believers, we must acknowledge that we have eternal life. We should not read the Bible but ignore the facts in the Bible. If this is our situation, our being will not correspond with the Word. It is sufficient to simply believe the words in the Bible. Since God says in His Word, &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life,&rdquo; we should say to Him, &ldquo;Amen! I believe! I have eternal life.&rdquo; We should not rely on our feelings. God never lies. If we say that we have believed but do not believe that we have eternal life, we are regarding God&rsquo;s words as a lie and God as a liar. Hence, in order for our being to correspond to the Bible, we should not rely on our feelings but believe in the words in the Bible. When God speaks, we should believe.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR BEING CORRESPONDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our being should also correspond to the Spirit. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; The Spirit in our spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. We know that the Spirit is witnessing in this way because when we pray, the Spirit leads us to call God, &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo; (v. 15). First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; When we pray, sometimes we call God our Father, and at other times we declare that Jesus is Lord. We call and declare this because the Spirit is in us.</p>
<p>When a believer prays to the Lord, he often addresses Him as Lord, and when he turns to God, he often addresses God as Father. We come to Jesus as our Lord and to God as our Father because the Spirit is in us. No one calls another person father in a casual way. Even when we force ourselves to address someone in this way, we do not have a pleasant sense within us. However, when we spontaneously address our father in the flesh as father, we have a sweet inward sense. In the same way, I believe that all the brothers and sisters spontaneously have a sweet inward sense when they call God their Father. The sweet inward feeling that we have when we call, &ldquo;O Father,&rdquo; is the witnessing of the Holy Spirit with our spirit.</p>
<p>A brother once asked, &ldquo;What does Romans 8:16 mean when it says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God?&rdquo; Another brother responded by asking him if he was married. When the first brother said that he was married, the second brother asked, &ldquo;When you went with your wife to meet her parents for the first time, what did you call your father-in-law?&rdquo; The first brother thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;It was a difficult situation. When I first met him, my wife called him &lsquo;Dad&rsquo; as soon as she saw him. I called him &lsquo;Dad&rsquo; as well but rather reluctantly, and my face turned red.&rdquo; Then the second brother asked, &ldquo;When you call your own father &lsquo;Dad,&rsquo; does your face turn red?&rdquo; When the first brother said that his face did not turn red, the second brother said, &ldquo;That is because your heart is witnessing that you are your father&rsquo;s child. In the same way, when we pray to God, we are able to call Him Father without any sense of embarrassment because the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are His children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me relate another story. One day a few of us knelt down to pray with an unbelieving friend. We were praising God in our prayer, saying, &ldquo;O Father, we praise You. Thank You for being our gracious Father.&rdquo; When we finished praying, the unbeliever said, &ldquo;I think that it is good to believe in Jesus, but I cannot pray like you. When I heard you calling God your Father, I was uncomfortable. Why were you not uncomfortable as well?&rdquo; His comment proved that the Spirit was not in him and that he had not yet been born of God to be a child of God.</p>
<p>The Bible is not merely a book of words; the words in the Bible are the pledge of our inheritance in Christ. Moreover, the Spirit is a living pledge in us, enabling us to know with certainty all the things promised by God in Christ. Hence, we should read the Bible diligently and follow the Spirit faithfully. The Bible in our hand is the word of the Spirit, whereas the Spirit in us is the Spirit of life. These two correspond to each other. As we read the Lord&rsquo;s words, the Holy Spirit moves within us to touch us, and the Spirit touches us by reminding us of the Lord&rsquo;s words. These two correspond with each other and enable us to be in life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORD BEING<br />
THE COMING FORTH OF GOD,<br />
AND THE SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE ENTERING IN OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: August 1, 1959<br />
Place: Hong Kong</h1>
<p>Second Timothy 3:16-17 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.&rdquo; All Scripture, the Bible, is profitable for teaching, instruction, and equipping us for every good work. First John 2:27 says, &ldquo;As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.&rdquo; Here the matter of teaching is associated with the anointing, the moving of the Spirit in us. When we contrast these two portions of the Bible, it is easy to see that the Scriptures and the anointing are related to each other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD BEING<br />
THE COMING FORTH OF GOD</h2>
<p>God is the Word, and He is in the Word (John 1:1). God is also the Spirit, and He is in the Spirit (4:24). If God were not the Word, it would be very difficult for us to contact or touch Him. However, as the Word, God is tangible and touchable because the Word is God expressed. If God were not the Word or if He did not speak, we would not be able to touch Him. This truth applies not only to the invisible God but even to visible men. If I stood on the podium but remained silent for an hour and a half, the saints would be puzzled and ask, &ldquo;What is the matter? What is Brother Lee thinking?&rdquo; However, when I speak, the saints know what I am thinking. The more I speak, the more they know me, because I am expressed through my words.</p>
<p>Words are the expression of a person. If a person does not speak, everything within him remains hidden, but as soon as he opens his mouth, everything begins to be revealed. Consider the story of Peter&rsquo;s denial of the Lord. When the Lord Jesus was arrested, Peter followed Him until he was in the courtyard of the high priest. While he was sitting with the attendants and warming himself in the light of the fire (Mark 14:54), a servant girl saw him and said, &ldquo;You also were with Jesus the Galilean.&rdquo; But Peter denied it, saying, &ldquo;I do not know what you are talking about!&rdquo; (Matt. 26:69-70). However, the more he denied it, the more he was exposed by his Galilean accent (v. 73). This shows that a person&rsquo;s words are the expression of the person.</p>
<p>In the same way, the Scriptures are God&rsquo;s words. God expresses Himself and explains Himself through His words. Consequently, 2 Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; When God breathes out, He breathes out Himself. All the words in the Bible, whether they relate to God&rsquo;s purpose, plan, or acts, express and explain God so that we may know Him and gain Him. Hence, we can say that the Scriptures are God expressed.</p>
<p>Since the Bible is such a wonderful book, we should never regard it as an academic book or as a book of religious teachings. The Bible surpasses every book. Although there are portions in the Bible that contain teachings which are seemingly related to conduct, the essence of the Bible is the expression of God, that is, God expressed. Every time we read the Bible, we should have a strong sense that the Bible is the expression of God Himself. We should realize that we are contacting the God who has been expressed. If this is our concept when we read the Bible, we will meet God and sense that God is appearing to us, no matter what chapter or verse we are reading.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Unable to Understand the Bible<br />
Not Being a Problem</h2>
<p>Some brothers and sister often say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, when I read the Bible, I cannot understand what I am reading, and I cannot remember what I have read. Consequently, I do not have much desire to read the Bible.&rdquo; When I hear this, I tell them that these are not problems at all, and I say, &ldquo;When you are invited to a meal, sometimes you are served Western food, and sometimes you are served Asian food. Although you do not always know what you are eating, you are still satisfied. As long as we are nourished and satisfied in our reading of the Bible, understanding what we have read is a secondary matter.</p>
<p>When we read 1 and 2 Chronicles, Daniel, or Revelation, there are many portions that are very difficult to understand. The book of Daniel, for example, records King Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream of a great human image with a head of gold, a breast and arms of silver, an abdomen and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet partly of iron and partly of clay (2:31-33). The meaning of this dream is not easy to understand. In the book of Revelation there are seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls (5:1-2; 8:6; 16:1), all of which are confusing to us. Nevertheless, after reading about Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream and about the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls, we feel as if we have been fed and satisfied, even though our understanding is limited. Even though we do not understand everything that we read, we do not have a feeling of being empty and hungry. After reading the Bible, we are fed and satisfied, even though our understanding is limited.</p>
<p>The benefit that we receive from reading the Bible is not utterly dependent upon our understanding, because the Bible, as the expression of God, is different from all other books. The usefulness of an ordinary book is utterly dependent upon our ability to understand what we have read. If we do not understand what we are reading, we will gain nothing. However, the Bible is not an ordinary book. Even when we do not fully understand what we are reading, we have a sense of satisfaction and nourishment when we open to the Lord in the Word. At such a time, we have a deep sensation that we have touched something spiritual that goes beyond our mental apprehension. This is because we have touched God Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Unable to Remember<br />
the Content of the Bible Not Being a Problem</h2>
<p>The principle is the same concerning not being able to remember what we have read in the Bible. We often do not remember what we ate several days ago, but this does not change the fact that we ate. This is often our experience in reading God&rsquo;s Word. Although we may forget what we have read, we must admit that we contacted God in our reading of the Bible.</p>
<p>This can be compared to a person being in the sunlight. Although he is under the shining of the sun for only five or ten minutes, the effect of the sunlight remains with him even when he is no longer outside. This can also be compared to taking a bath. When a person completes a bath, he dries off the bathwater. Although he is no longer wet, the dirt on his body has been washed away. It is the same with reading the Bible. Although we may not understand much and may remember even less, we receive the shining of God&rsquo;s face and the washing of the water in the word when we read the Bible (Eph. 5:26). As a result, we are enlightened and refreshed. It is sufficient to read the Bible in this way.</p>
<p>It is not necessary that we fully understand or remember what we have read in the Bible. It is more important that we contact God&rsquo;s word, that is, the expression of God, which is also God expressed. Whenever we read the Bible, we must have the concept that we are not studying it with our mind but contacting God Himself with our heart and spirit. When we read the Bible and contact God in this way, we will be satisfied. If this is our situation, being unable to remember what we have read will not be a problem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Avoiding Curiosity and Inquisitiveness<br />
When Reading the Bible</h2>
<p>When we read the Bible, we must guard against being distracted by our curiosity and inquisitiveness. In reading the Bible many Christians are distracted by their curiosity and inquisitiveness. For example, the first verse in the New Testament says, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham&rdquo; (Matt. 1:1). These words immediately cause us to want to know more about David and Abraham, and the following verses, which contain a whole series of fathers begetting sons, raise more questions in our mind. Since we do not understand what we have read, we can spend much time looking for answers in reference books. Even after much research, however, we still have not gained anything. This is an example of being distracted by curiosity and inquisitiveness when reading the Bible.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we should not be too inquisitive. We should always bear in mind that the Bible is the expression of God. Hence, when we read the Bible, our goal should be to contact God. It is good if we understand what we are reading, but if we come across something that we do not understand, we should not strain for an understanding. If we read chapter 1 of Matthew in this way, without being bothered by our inability to understand and without being distracted by a desire to merely seek knowledge, we will have a sense of enlightenment and freshness when we finish reading the chapter. It will be as if we are under the shining of the sun and the washing of water. First and foremost, we need to remember that we should read the Bible to contact God.</p>
<p>The Bible is the Word of God, the expression of God. God expresses Himself in order that He may enter into us to be our life. God is so mysterious that without the Word, it would be very difficult to contact Him. Thankfully, He is the Word. When we touch and contact the Word, we can touch and contact God. Therefore, in order for us to contact God and enjoy Him as life, we must read the Bible. However, when we read the Bible, we must be careful not to fall into the temptation of merely studying with our mind. We must have the firm realization that the Bible is the expression of God. Therefore, we need to use our heart and spirit to contact the words in the Bible. If we do this, we will be inwardly satisfied, restful, and watered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF GOD<br />
BEING THE ENTERING IN OF GOD</h2>
<p>God is not only the Word and in His words, but He is also the Spirit and in the Spirit. God is in His words for His expression, and God is in the Spirit for His entering into us. The Word is God coming forth to us, God being expressed, and the Spirit is God entering into us. Hence, the Word is God&rsquo;s coming forth, whereas the Spirit is God&rsquo;s entering in. As the Word, God presents Himself to us; as the Spirit, God enters into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word Being outside of Us and<br />
the Spirit Being within Us</h2>
<p>In actuality, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. Outside of us, the Spirit is embodied in the Word; inside of us, the Word is realized as the Spirit. Whenever we receive the words of the Bible into our being, these words become spirit and life and are realized as the Spirit. Although the words in 2 Corinthians 6:14 seemingly speak only of not being dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers, we can sense the operation of the Spirit in us when we read this verse. As soon as these words enter into us, we realize them as the Spirit.</p>
<p>When the words of the Bible become the Spirit in us and operate in us, they are life to us. Even though the Bible is a book of life, this is not readily apparent because outwardly the Bible appears to be just a book. The words in the Bible must be read and received into us so that the words in the Bible can become life to us through the operating Spirit. The Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). This shows that His words are life only when they are spirit to us. If the Bible is merely words to us, it will not be life to us. The words in the Bible must become the Spirit to us, and then they also will be life. The words in the Bible become the Spirit when they enter into us. Strictly speaking, if the Bible is only a book in our hands, its words will not be life to us but rather letter, because they are only in our mind. The words in the Bible will become the Spirit to us when we read the Bible with our spirit and allow the words in the Bible to touch our spirit and enter into us.</p><h2 class="head2">Experiencing God<br />
as the Word and as the Spirit</h2>
<p>If we desire to know God and experience Him as our life, we must experience Him as both the Word and the Spirit, because today He is in His words and also in the Spirit. Touching God and contacting God is not something that should be abstract to us. Rather, it is something that can be genuine and real if we calm down our outer man, rein in our mind, and exercise our spirit to read and contact the Lord in the Word. Then His Word will become the Spirit operating in us. In this way we will contact God in our spirit.</p>
<p>This is a marvelous and mysterious matter. The Triune God is in His words and in the Spirit, and the Spirit and the Word are connected. If we had only the Spirit, God would be beyond our comprehension, but because His Word is connected to the Spirit, God can become very real to us. Contacting God is not a matter of religious practice. Religious regulations can only tell people what to do, but God&rsquo;s salvation involves His entrance into us to be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Entering into Us to Be Our Life<br />
through the Word and the Spirit</h2>
<p>God can be our life because, as the Word, He became flesh, and then through death and resurrection, the Word, who became flesh, became the life-giving Spirit. As the Spirit, God enters into all those who believe into Christ. Incarnation brought God into man; death and resurrection brought man into God. In this way God accomplished a mingling and union of God and man and man and God so that He could enter into man as the Spirit to be man&rsquo;s life. The Spirit contains many elements, including divinity, humanity, death, resurrection, the mingling of humanity and divinity, and the heavenly element. These elements are in the Spirit.</p>
<p>However, even though God is the Spirit with all these elements, He can still be abstract to us. Therefore, sympathizing with our weakness and according to the extent of our capacity to understand, He also gave us the Bible. This Bible contains God&rsquo;s words, God&rsquo;s breathing. God is Spirit, but the Spirit has been connected with the words in the Bible. Hence, we can say that the words in the Bible are the embodiment of the Spirit. The life in the Word is the Spirit, and the embodiment of the Spirit is the Word. Thank God that He comes to us not only as the Spirit but also in His Word. He not only gives us the Spirit but also His Word. This is great grace to us! When we contact His Word, the Spirit enters into us.</p>
<p>When our condition is normal, every time we read the Bible, we will contact His words outwardly but receive the Spirit inwardly. Whenever we receive His Word, we also receive the Spirit. The result of receiving God as the Spirit is to receive life. If we contact God, experience God, and receive God as Spirit through the Word, we will experience Him as our life.</p>
<p>I hope that we will learn to use the Bible outside of us and to contact the Spirit within us. We are truly rich! We have the Spirit in us, and we also have the Bible in our hand. The riches in these two items are inexhaustible! For two thousand years no one has exhausted these riches; the more a person touches them, the richer they become. I have been touching them for thirty-five years, and I can testify that the more I touch them, the richer they become. The riches that we have received cannot be exhausted in our experience. We do not possess silver and gold (Acts 3:6), but we have something much more valuable; we have the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Doing All Things according to<br />
the Word and the Spirit</h2>
<p>Now that we have the Word and the Spirit, we should conduct ourselves in our daily living according to the Word and the Spirit. We should not go against either the Word or the Spirit. Christ has released us and set us free, but we should not go beyond the Word and the Spirit. Whenever we are not in agreement with either the Word or the Spirit, we should always allow the Word and the Spirit to win. We must let ourselves be defeated. We should be submissive and allow the Word and the Spirit to touch us. We must learn to continually match the Word and the Spirit in our being. It is better to be defeated and suffer a loss, even if it involves sorrow, than to offend the Word or the Spirit. If this is our attitude, we will be able to touch the Lord&rsquo;s words and receive the Spirit every day, and we will have a practical experience of God as life.</p></body></html>
