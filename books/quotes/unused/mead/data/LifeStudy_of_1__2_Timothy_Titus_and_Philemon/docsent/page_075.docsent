   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Acts 13 Paul and Barnabas turned to the Gentiles after the Jews rejected the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 46 says, "It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles" lit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. Verse 48 says, "And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reason these Gentiles could receive the word of the Lord and believe is that they were destined, even predestinated, to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, we who believe in Christ today are God's chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Titus 1:1 Paul does not speak of the faith of the believers, but of the faith of God's chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By so doing he indicates that the initiative for believing in Christ comes from God, not from us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because God has chosen us to believe in Christ, we have come to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul was an apostle according to the faith of God's chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He had this faith, and we have it also.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through faith Paul was brought into the organic union with the Triune God, and in this way he could receive the supply of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul could stand against the Roman Empire not because he was strong or capable in himself, but because he had received eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was an apostle according to this eternal life, the eternal life which he received through the faith which brought him into an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have pointed out that Paul also says that he became an apostle according to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Again and again we have seen that the truth in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus denotes the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should have not only the faith of God's chosen ones, but also the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have the faith to bring us into the organic union, and we have the full knowledge of the truth of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that we know Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually Paul's apostleship involved four factors: God's command, eternal life, faith, and the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of these four elements, Paul was one who troubled religion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was even called a pestilent fellow, a troublemaker.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of these four elements, two are on God's side the command and the eternal life and two are on our side faith and the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we first believed in the Lord Jesus, we had faith, but we did not have the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord that in His recovery we have the full knowledge of the truth!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Titus 1:2 says that eternal life was "promised before times eternal."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the promise was not given directly to the chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, the promise was made by the Father to the Son in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 17:2 seems to refer to this: "Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By receiving eternal life the believers, who were given to the Son in eternity, become His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 2:11 refers to the brothers of Christ: "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the promise of eternal life was made by the Father to the Lord Jesus in eternity, the Bible says that God chose us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God did not choose us directly; He chose us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In like manner, the promise of eternal life concerning us was given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, in the Son we now receive this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to verse 3, God not only promised eternal life before times eternal, but "in its own times has manifested His word in the proclamation."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The eternal life was promised by the Father to the Son; however, what God the Father has manifested is not eternal life, but His word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By reading verses 2 and 3 carefully, we see that the word manifested is the equivalent of the eternal life promised.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul does not say that God promised eternal life and then manifested this eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He says that God promised eternal life and then manifested His word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, God's word is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If His word is not the eternal life directly, it is at least the means of conveying eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our experience we have eternal life through the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The expression "its own times" refers to the times related to eternal life mentioned in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God promised eternal life through the Son concerning us in eternity, but the proclamation was made in different ages and at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God manifested His eternal life in His word by preaching, that is, by proclamation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This proclamation was made in Asia Minor at one time and in Europe at a different time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul here does not say that eternal life was manifested by the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, he speaks of times, the word, and the proclamation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The eternal life promised was manifested at different times by proclamation, by the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This manifestation first took place on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later the proclamation went to Antioch, Asia Minor, and Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Centuries later this proclamation reached China.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, "its own times" denotes the various times God's word is manifested in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul was entrusted with this proclamation according to the command of our Savior God.</S>
