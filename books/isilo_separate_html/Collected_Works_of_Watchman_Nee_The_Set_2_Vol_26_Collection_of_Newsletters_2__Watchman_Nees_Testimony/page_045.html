There were brothers and sisters attending this conference from twelve different provinces. Although they spoke different dialects, had different ways of living, different personal backgrounds, and different levels of spirituality, most of the people were of one mind in seeking God's eternal purpose, in pleasing God, and in expressing Christ's heart of love in the testimony of oneness. This is the first point for which we give thanks.</p><p>The brothers and sisters from the various places were not only served by us but also served us. The Lord used this to teach us, the brothers and sisters in Hangchow, a lesson so that we would know how to serve His members from now on. This is the second point for which we give thanks.</p><p>Brother Nee has been physically weak, but during this conference he showed no sign of weakness. Every time he spoke, his spirit was living and his body was strong. The audience was attentive throughout. This is the third point for which we give thanks.</p><p>The work the sisters did in serving one another surpassed us, the brothers. This is the fourth point for which we give thanks.</p><p>Our brothers were tested much this time with fatalities, physical injuries, robberies, and all manner of trials. Thank God, these did not discourage our brothers; on the contrary, our brothers really saw God's glory manifested through us. This is the fifth point for which we give thanks.</p><p>In this conference, God did not just edify us spiritually; He also made our hearts joyful because our Brother Nee was married after the conference (October 19). Elder Brother T'ien P'ing Fang from Ch'ang-ch'un was the witness, while the head of the groom's household, Mr. Nee Wen Hsiu, and the head of the bride's household, Mr. Chang Ju Lin, were the directors of the wedding. More than two hundred people attended the wedding. From now on, our Brother Nee will have the good wife God gave him to serve him. This is the sixth point for which we give thanks.</p><p>The preceding few points are a simple record of the conference in Hangchow. May all the thanks, honor, glory, and riches be to our heavenly Father forever and ever, amen.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Jan Ch'i Yu<br />January 18, 1935</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM T'ENG YUEH, YUNNAN PROVINCE</h2><p>Brother Yueh Chiao:</p><p>I received your package of books a long time ago. There were fifty-six books all together, both large and small; thank you. Those books have already been laid out in the Gospel Book Service Room in Yi Lo County for anyone to read. Brother Lee K'o San recently came here from Shun Ning. He comes to the Book Service Room every day to read the books sent by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room.</p><p>It is not easy to gain a brother in this place because many people smoke. The tobacco in Yunnan is famous for its good flavor and low price. Business and industry are not well developed in this region, so there is a lot of free time. They have nothing to do all day, so they smoke to pass the time. We have to do two kinds of work here. Before we preach the Word to them, we must first exhort them to quit smoking. If they want to quit, we help them with medicine for quitting smoking. Thank God, the brothers who come to the meetings quit smoking first and then turned to the Lord. Unfortunately, my knowledge of the Bible is very shallow, and I am very busy with official business, so I cannot lead them well. I hope I can leave my position in customs to testify for the Lord full-time. This place is too remote and communication is too difficult, so it is very inconvenient to invite Christians to come here. You can say that no one has been here before. I want to take this opportunity to work a little for the Lord here. I am sending you a check for twenty dollars to be used in the costs of sending the books by registered mail and as a small help to the cost of publication. Furthermore, I plan to print more copies of some of the smaller books put out by the Gospel Book Room. Could you advise me about this? May you have peace in the Lord. Greet Brother Nee and the other brothers for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Ts'ai Ying Ming<br />December 8, 1934</p><p>Mailing Address: Custom House, T'eng Yueh, Yunnan province</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
