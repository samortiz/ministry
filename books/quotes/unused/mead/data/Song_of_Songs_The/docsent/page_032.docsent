   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hair Signifying Consecration and Obedience</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hair is only briefly mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With Samson, hair signifies consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Keeping his hair signified that he reserved all that he had for God's use.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our consecration before God determines our power before men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The amount of consecration we have before God and the degree of the perfection and purity of the consecration determines the amount of power we will have before men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A sanctifying consecration is the basis of all strength.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Another significance of hair in the Bible is covering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A woman's hair and the Nazarite's hair convey this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It means standing in the position of obedience, covering up that which is of man, that which is natural and fleshly, and allowing God to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Most goats are white.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mount Gilead is a place with many goats and much grass Jer 50:19; Micah 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Goats are used in the Bible as sin offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The hair of the maiden is as a flock of goats beside Mount Gilead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a symbol; it means that she is well fed and ready to be offered up as an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where is our consecration and obedience manifested?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is manifested at the place where we receive God's feeding and food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both the feeding and the food are for the purpose of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is where our power lies, and this is where our obedience lies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Teeth Signifying the Power of Receiving</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The teeth are for chewing food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a matter of food itself, but a matter of receiving food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has shown us in the Bible that He has given us different kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse shows us the power of receiving different kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Symbolically speaking, the power of receiving does not belong to babes, but to grown-ups, because only grown-ups have teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why does it say "a flock of sheep"?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because only sheep eat grass.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is something within a person that is of Christ; therefore, one is able to receive God's food.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only that which matches the Christ within will take in that which comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Bible sheep's wool denotes the fleshly life, or the fleshly zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a priest entered the Holy of Holies, he was not allowed to wear anything that was made of wool Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>44:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Bible the righteousness that Christ gives to us through the Holy Spirit is symbolized by white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The natural life of the saints has been removed by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, this verse says that the maiden's teeth are like a flock that has been shorn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It means that her power of reception is no longer motivated by natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In pursuing after the Lord, in receiving His grace, and in our study of the Bible, we must not exercise fleshly zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Exercising our own strength and following our own ways is having teeth that are disapproved of by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The shorn flock is also washed; it is clean and orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The washing signifies that the goal of the maiden's pursuit is the cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"Whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means orderliness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It means that the power of reception is uniform throughout.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One does not reject some things and receive other things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One does not possess faith in spiritual things, but no faith in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If one only receives certain truths, or if he cannot have faith in material things, his teeth do not bear twins, and some of them are barren.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Bearing twins and not being barren is receiving in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our natural teeth are always in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The maiden's teeth bearing twins means that her receiving power is even and uniform throughout.</S>
