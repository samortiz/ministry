<h1 class="title">MEETING AND WORSHIPPING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>It is not easy to change the atmosphere in the churches, because we have been entrenched in old concepts for many years. Our need is to change our concept. We are not aware of the influence Christianity has upon us. For example, every believer has the concept that they should attend a worship service. They may not use the phrase <em>worship service,</em> but they have this concept. They also have the concept that a worship service consists of singing hymns, praying, listening to the Scriptures, and listening to a sermon. If we do not drop this concept, every change that we make will be superficial. For example, we can paint a podium a different color. Even though the color has changed, the nature of the podium has not changed. It seems as though we still want a meeting with singing, praying, reading the Scriptures, and one person giving a message. Hence, when we encourage everyone to participate by calling and pray-reading, we still may be changing only our method.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the influence of Christianity we do not bear responsibility in the meetings. We know that there will be some brothers to lead the meeting. Therefore, we do not come to the meeting with a sense of responsibility. Our meetings should not be led by some designated brothers. If anyone is designated to lead the meeting, it should be everyone. All the brothers and the sisters who come to the meeting should bear responsibility for the meeting. If we all have the attitude that others should bear the responsibility for the meeting, our meetings will have no impact.</p>
<p>We subconsciously have the concept that Christians do not have to bear any responsibility when they meet. Christians in the denominations have pastors who bear the responsibility for the meetings. We also have brothers, such as elders or co-workers, who bear the responsibility for our meetings. When we go to a district meeting, there are brothers who bear the responsibility. I would advise the responsible ones in the districts not to sit on the first row; instead, they should sit on the last row. If the brothers and sisters do not function, the responsible brothers should not function in their place. If the responsible brothers resign, the meetings will still continue. The meetings are not for the responsible brothers. The meetings are for all the saints. Hence, the elders and co-workers should sit in the back rows. At the end of the meeting an elder can go to the front and give the announcements. The meeting is the responsibility of the saints, not the elders.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANS FUNCTIONING MAINLY IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The concept that we attend a meeting but are not responsible for the meeting is a fundamental error. It is a ploy of Satan to render the members of the Body of Christ useless so that they cease to function. As members of the Body, we function mainly in the meetings (1 Cor. 14:26). We should never think that we have a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; function, such as sweeping the floor, cleaning the windows, or visiting the saints, that excuses us from functioning in the meetings. These are good services, but they are not our main function. Our main function is to offer up our portion in the meetings. The main function of the members of a basketball team is to play basketball, not to run errands or buy sports shoes. Running errands and buying shoes cannot compare to playing basketball. As Christians, we are members of Christ, and our most important service is to meet. The meetings are the best opportunity for us to exhibit Christ. As Christians, we are commissioned to exhibit Christ in the meetings. If our meetings do not exhibit Christ, they are a failure. Whether a local church is strong or weak depends on its meetings. If the meetings are good, the church is strong, but if the meetings are poor, the church is weak. We overlook the importance of the meetings because we have been blinded by Satan.</p>
<p>Some believers are blinded to the extent that they are indifferent toward the meetings. They think that it is good enough to fear God, love the Lord, fellowship with Him, and love others. This kind of attitude is a proof of the success of Satan&rsquo;s scheme. Everything that a Christian does on earth is for the cultivation of the meetings. A basketball team exists to play basketball. If there were no basketball games, there would be no need to have a basketball team. Similarly, if there are no meetings, there is no need to have the church. The church exists for the meetings. Our concept needs to be changed. We must understand that the meetings are the main place for Christians to function.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
