BEING TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>As serving ones in the localities, we can be compared to ones working in a construction company. In a construction company some people are engineers, some are master builders, some are skilled workers, and others carry sand and wood. We have different functions, but there is only one goal, which is to build up the mutual dwelling place of God and man in the universe.</p>
<p>We must see that all the work in the New Testament is for the one goal of building up the church, the dwelling place of God. When Peter recognized that the Lord Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord immediately told the disciples that He would build His church (Matt. 16:16, 18). When the apostles later went out to work, they were building up the eternal dwelling place of God. The apostle Paul says that they were God&rsquo;s fellow workers in order to build up His dwelling place. Eventually, when the work of God is consummated at the end of the Bible, the New Jerusalem will be manifested as the eternal dwelling place of God (Rev. 21:2-3). Therefore, we need to see that all of God&rsquo;s work, especially His work in the New Testament, is for the one goal of building His house.</p>
<p>Even our preaching the gospel and saving souls are for the building up of God&rsquo;s house. Proper gospel preaching will not hinder the building; rather, it contributes to the building. Preaching the gospel can be compared to cutting trees and mining stones, that is, to gaining the materials for the building. It would be a gross error to talk about building while our numbers decrease, that is, while the building materials are being stolen by the devil. It is useless to merely talk about building. On the one hand, we need to preserve the existing materials from being lost or stolen by Satan, but on the other hand, we also need to fight the battle in order to rescue more building materials, precious souls, from under Satan&rsquo;s usurpation. Preaching the gospel is simply to obtain materials for the building. We need to have such an understanding.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING NOT BEING A SIMPLE MATTER</h2>
<p>Those who have built a house know that it is not a simple matter. Although there is one common goal, there are numerous minute details; none of which are easy. I have participated in several projects for building meeting halls in the past. The most difficult thing is to acquire a site. More than ten years ago we wanted to build a meeting hall in a certain locality. We spent much time and effort to find a piece of land. When we were ready to purchase the property, other parties came to compete with us. They used various ways to frustrate us. Through much prayer and the exercise of wisdom, we finally acquired the land. After purchasing the land, however, we found out that a portion of the land in the center of our property belonged to someone else. It was through more prayer and negotiations that we finally obtained the entire property.</p>
<p>When we wanted to build a meeting hall in Shanghai that could hold three thousand people, we put much effort into buying the land. We spent about nine months looking for the site, and we considered at least twenty to thirty properties before we finally found the one that we wanted. However, the buying process was long and complicated. The same thing happened in Manila. Although we purchased a piece of land a few years ago in order to build a meeting hall, we have to wait because the site is currently occupied. Therefore, the first step in building a house is to obtain the site, but this step is not easy. Likewise, if we want to build up the church, we must first obtain the proper ground as the site of the building. Concerning the proper ground, we have suffered Satan&rsquo;s severe attacks and interferences.</p>
<p>After obtaining the site, we need to gather the materials for the building. Sometimes the material that we need is not available because others do not want to sell it. Besides obtaining the material, the contractors may not be very cooperative. Sometimes the contractors are cooperative, but when the work begins, the weather is not suitable. Sometimes the weather is suitable, but the building cannot proceed because the workers cannot coordinate.</p>
<p>Hence, in the physical realm building can be very difficult. It is even more difficult to build in the spiritual realm. God desires to gain a building site, building materials, and fellow workers from a fallen, mixed, and chaotic human race. He also desires to gain the cooperation of all kinds of environments so that He may build His eternal dwelling place. How difficult this must be! For the past two thousand years He has not completed this building. Although Bible students have seen a glimpse of the blueprint of God&rsquo;s building, too many problems have hindered the practical building. We should not consider the building of God to be an easy task or consider that we can build up the church simply by encouraging people to attend a conference, study the Bible, or fellowship with one another. This is not the way. God&rsquo;s building requires extraordinary work and extraordinary effort.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> </body></html>
