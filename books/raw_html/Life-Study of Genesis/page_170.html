<H2 CLASS=HEAD6>e) To Receive the Spirit</H2><P>Another reason for calling on the Lord is to receive the Spirit (Acts 2:17, 21). The best and easiest way to be filled with the Holy Spirit is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. The Spirit has already been poured out. We simply need to receive Him by calling on the Lord. We can do it anytime. If you call on the name of the Lord several times, you will be filled with the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>f) To Drink the Spiritual Water<br>and to Eat the Spiritual Food for Satisfaction</H2><P>Isaiah 55:1 says, "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price." What is the way to eat and drink the Lord? Isaiah gives us the way in verse 6 of the same chapter: "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near." Thus, the way to drink the spiritual water and to eat the spiritual food for our satisfaction is to seek the Lord and to call upon His name.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>g) To Enjoy the Riches of the Lord</H2><P>Romans 10:12 says that the Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him. The Lord is rich and rich to all who call upon Him. The way to enjoy the riches of the Lord is to call upon Him. The Lord is not only rich, but also nigh and available as mentioned in verse 8 of the same chapter because He is the life-giving Spirit. As the Spirit, He is omnipresent. At any time and in any place we may call on His name. When we call on Him, He comes to us as the Spirit, and we enjoy His riches. When you call on Jesus, the Spirit comes.</P><P>First Corinthians is a book on the enjoyment of Christ. In chapter twelve Paul tells us how to enjoy Him. The way to enjoy the Lord is to call on His name (12:3; 1:2). Whenever we say, "Lord Jesus," we drink of Him, the life-giving Spirit (v. 13). In 15:45 we are told that the Lord is now the life-giving Spirit. Whenever we call, "Lord Jesus," He comes as the Spirit. If I call a person's name, and if he is real, living, and present, then that person will come to me. The Lord Jesus is real, living, and present. He is always available. Whenever we call on Him, He comes. Even during the Old Testament times Moses said of the Lord, "For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is whenever we call upon him" (Deut. 4:7, Heb.). Whenever we call upon His name, He is nigh (Psa. 145:18). Do you want to enjoy the Lord's presence with all His riches? The best way to experience His presence with all His riches is to call on His name. Call on Him while you are driving on the freeway or while you are at work. Anywhere and anytime you call, the Lord is nigh and rich to you.</P>
