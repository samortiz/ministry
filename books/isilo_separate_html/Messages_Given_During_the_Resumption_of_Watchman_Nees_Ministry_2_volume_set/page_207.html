Mammon stands in opposition to God. Today, more people are gained by mammon than those gained by God. Perhaps of a hundred people, eighty are gained by mammon. Of the remaining twenty, eighteen to nineteen serve both God and mammon. It is difficult to find one in a hundred who truly serves God. Mammon gains more souls than God does.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Deliverance from Mammon Being<br>the Basic Qualification for One to Serve God</H2><P>Originally, we had no intention during this time to speak about mammon. We were going to look at the matter of the Body life. Later, the fellowship about the Body life led to a second problem. The first problem is individualism, and the second problem is mammon. Individualism frustrates man from serving God. Mammon also frustrates man from serving God. If a man serves mammon, not only will there be no service to God corporately, but individually that person will not be able to serve God either. We can say that deliverance from mammon is the first and the foremost condition for one to serve God. If a man is not delivered from mammon, he cannot serve God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Money Being Satan's Means<br>to Unify All Things</H2><P>All things are created by God. God is the unique source of all things; He is above all things. When men see all things, they should be moved to worship God. Today, the human mind invented atheism, and it is obviously wrong. The heavens move men to know God. "All things" are diverse and complicated. Satan wants to unify all things. There is no way to add up all things. For example, a chair and a table cannot be added together to make one unit. What is an adult plus a child plus a piece of luggage plus a bar of gold plus a piece of land? They do not add up to one unit. However, if you convert all these things into money, you can add them up. If all things cannot be unified, how can the businessmen do their accounting? With so many different units, how can one reckon their values? Money is the only means by which we can reckon all things. With money, a piece of land becomes no more a piece of land; it becomes money. Rice becomes no more rice; it becomes money. When we add together all things, we end up with a certain amount of money. In the end, Revelation 18 tells us that even the human soul can be reckoned with money. When a man sells his time to work for others, he is selling his soul. For example, when I hire a laborer, I agree with him ahead of time how much I will pay him for working eight hours. This is to buy the human soul with money. Money can buy us the human soul, and money can buy us all things. God created the earth, yet man divided it up into pieces and reckoned the value of every piece with money. If man can occupy the land on the moon, he will sell it for money also. Even for airplanes to fly over the earth, man charges people for access of the air space. Perhaps some people think that this is nothing unusual. But to us, and to the Bible, this is very strange. In six days, God created all things. Can you find out how much money "all things" are worth? Here are all sorts of things, in all fashions and colors. Yet Satan has simplified these things and unified them under money. This is why money is called in Chinese "the common goods."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_206.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_208.html">Next</a> </body></html>
