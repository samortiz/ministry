   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LONGING FOR THE GUILELESS MILK OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 2 says, As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Born through regeneration 1:3, 23 , the believers become babes who can grow in life unto further salvation, and that for God s building, by being nourished with the spiritual milk.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Guileless in verse 2 does not mean unadulterated, in contrast to less pure teachings; instead, it is guileless in contrast to the guile in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Guileless milk is milk without false purpose, without any other goal but to nourish the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word rendered of the word is logikos.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This word, in Romans 12:1 translated reasonable, is derived from the noun logos the word; hence, of the word; having the sense of pertaining to the mind in contrast to the body , to the rational faculties; hence, rational, logical, reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The milk of the word is not milk for the body, but is milk for the soul, the inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is conveyed in the word of God to nourish our inner man through the understanding of our rational mind, and it is assimilated by our mental faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As far as grammar is concerned, verse 1 is a modifier of the subject of verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have pointed out, guileless in verse 2 is in contrast to guile in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Recovery Version may be unique in using guileless milk in the translation of verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Other versions have pure milk or sincere milk.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It may be that Peter intended guileless to include the meaning of pure and sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the purpose of Peter s writing here is to show a contrast between guilelessness and the guile that proceeds out of malice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What can swallow up, or eliminate, our guile?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The nourishment contained in the guileless milk of the word is an antibiotic for guile.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Word of God there is a nourishment that is milk for our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just as our physical body is nourished with milk, so our inner being, our soul, needs to be nourished with the guileless milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This milk contains an element that can eliminate our guile.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the milk of the word is guileless milk.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 2:1 and 2, Peter indicates that, as newborn babes, we need to practice putting away all guile, and we also need to desire the guileless milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The purpose of putting away the evil root of malice is that we may long for, desire, the milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that Peter wrote this not according to doctrine, but according to his spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not have adequate experience, we shall not be able to understand what Peter is saying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you are full of malice, guile, hypocrisy, envy, and evil speaking, you will not have any appetite for the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You will not be hungry or thirsty for the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You will not have the longing, the desire, to drink the pure milk of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you want to hunger and thirst after God s word, that is, if you want to desire the drinking of the milk in the word, you need to hate your malice and abstain from speaking evil things about others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose for quite a long period of time, perhaps more than a year, a particular brother has been filled with malice.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Certain brothers, especially the elders, he does not like.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because he is full of malice and also full of guile, hypocrisies, and envyings, spontaneously he begins to speak negatively about others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He may speak evil concerning both brothers and sisters, both older ones and younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This evil speaking has its source in the malice within him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To be sure, a brother in that condition will not have any appetite for the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From experience I know that he would neither hunger nor thirst for the nourishment in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, let us suppose that this particular brother receives the mercy of the Lord one day to realize his sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Realizing his need of Christ as the sin offering and the trespass offering, he repents, confesses his sins, and prays, O Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For a long time, I have been filled with malice, and I have spoken in an evil way about others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, this shows me that sin is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Lord, even though I have been regenerated, I still have sin in me, for my fallen nature is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>O Lord, I need You as my sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I take You and apply You as my sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Oh, may the blood of the sin offering cleanse me, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I realize that my evil speaking concerning the brothers and sisters is an offense, a trespass.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lord, I am full of trespasses!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Forgive me and cleanse me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I take You not only as my sin offering, but also as my trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All day long, Lord, I want to enjoy You.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the brother prays in this way, soon he will begin to have an appetite for the milk of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will desire to come to the Word for nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He will come to the Bible not to gain the knowledge of doctrine, but to drink nourishing milk.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Spontaneously as he is reading the Bible, he will be drinking the guileless milk of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, this milk will get into his inward being and function as an antibiotic to kill the germ of malice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, this brother will begin to love all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He may say, Oh, I love the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I love all the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the saints are good, and all of them are better than I am.</S>
