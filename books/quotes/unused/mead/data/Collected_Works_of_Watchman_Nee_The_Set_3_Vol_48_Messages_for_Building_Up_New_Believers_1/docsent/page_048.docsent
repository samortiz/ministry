   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ANNULLING OF DISTINCTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fourth distinction that has been abolished in Christ is that of gender, that is, the distinction between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this world the male occupies one role and the female occupies another role.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In church administration the male also has his place and the female her place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Within the family the husband has his place and the wife has her place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, in Christ and in the new man, both the man and the woman have the same stand; there is no distinction between them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Christ, the man does not occupy a special place, nor does the woman, because Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this respect a man is no different from a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please remember that in spiritual matters there is no distinction between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have mentioned that the sisters' place in some areas of service is different from that of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this pertains only to the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today, in Christ, there is no difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A brother is saved through the life of Christ, the life of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way, a sister is saved through the life of Christ, the life of God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every case in the Bible where the Chinese version translates "sons and daughters," the original word is children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word does not differentiate between male or female even though its usage is masculine .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am born a child of God and grow up to be a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A son is male.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet this description fits both the brothers as well as the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the whole New Testament, only 2 Corinthians 6:17-18 speaks of sons and daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Therefore come out from their midst...and I will welcome you'; and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me.'"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we have believed in God and are delivered and separated from the world and its polluted and unclean influence, God will receive us like a Father, and we will be His sons and His daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a matter between God and an individual; it is not a matter of what a person is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why it says sons and daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a person suffers for God, incurs loss for His sake, and experiences hardship because of Him, God will become a Father to such a one as an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you are male, God will receive you as a son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are female, God will receive you as a daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God will receive you as His sons and daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the all-sufficient Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has everything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a matter of what a person is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It has nothing to do with what he or she is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Christ, we are all God's children, and there is no distinction between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This distinction does not exist at all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once I asked a certain craftsman in Shanghai, who was a brother in the Lord, "Brother, how are the brothers in your place doing?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He replied, "Are you asking about the male brothers or the female brothers?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This answer could not have been put better.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is one of the truest words ever spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Male brothers are brothers and female brothers are also brothers; there is no distinction in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What this brother said was absolutely correct; he was simply stating the biblical truth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we come to the Lord and touch Him, we transcend all male and female distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are beyond gender.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before the Lord and in Christ, there is no distinction between male and female.</S>
