Actually, our regeneration is our resurrection together with the Lord. This is because the death of the Lord, (i.e., our dying with Him) solved the problem of our sinful life. When the Lord resurrected (i.e., when we were resurrected with Him), He gave us a new life to commence as Christians. For this reason, the Bible says, "God..has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" (1 Pet. 1:3). Thus, every regenerated Christian is one who has been resurrected with the Lord. However, the apostle told us in Philippians 3 that a Christian should pursue to "know Him and the power of His resurrection" (v. 10). Many Christians have been regenerated and resurrected together with the Lord, but they lack the manifestation of the power of resurrection.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
