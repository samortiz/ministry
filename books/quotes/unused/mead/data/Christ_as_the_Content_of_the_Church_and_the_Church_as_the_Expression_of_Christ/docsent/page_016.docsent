   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE TABERNACLE AND ITS COVERING TYPIFYING THE CHURCH AS THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Exo 26:1, 7, 14 THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH SEEN IN THE TYPE OF THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 26:1 says, "Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shalt thou make them."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, the tabernacle was covered with ten curtains of fine twined linen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 7 says, "And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the curtains of fine linen were the curtains of goats' hair.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 14 says, "And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of porpoise skins" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this verse two coverings are mentioned: the covering of rams' skins dyed red and the covering of porpoise skins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows us that the tabernacle had four layers of covering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first layer was the ten curtains of fine twined linen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second layer was the curtains of goats' hair.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The third layer was the covering of the rams' skins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fourth layer, the last layer, was the covering of porpoise skins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These coverings have much to do with God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord's building of His dwelling place is not just a matter of having an outward pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The building of the church is dependent upon Christ being wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through the birth of life and the growth in life, a living person is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This living person does not just have an outward pattern or form.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A replica of a person may be produced by being manufactured in the way of imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This replica has the pattern, shape, and likeness of a person but not the life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The building up of the church is not merely a matter of having an outward pattern but a matter of the birth of life and the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The real pattern comes into being by the growth of life, not by organization or outward formation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A living person with an outward form comes into being by birth and by growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one manufactured or shaped him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, he was organically shaped into his present form by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same way, the building up of the church is a matter of the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every part and aspect of the tabernacle typifies either the work of Christ or Christ Himself being something to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The tabernacle typifies that by the redemptive work of Christ, He Himself has to be wrought into us as everything in life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the outer court is the altar, typifying the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By Christ's all-inclusive death on the cross, He accomplished everything needed for us to have a right relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we come to Him, confessing that we are sinners and that we have been put to an end by His death, we receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we go to the laver, signifying the cleansing, purging, purifying work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The washing of the Spirit purifies us from all defilement so that we may be pure, clean, and suitable to have Christ wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After these two items, the real building itself is seen in the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everywhere in the tabernacle there is something of wood overlaid with gold, signifying the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The human nature is overlaid with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Divinity has been wrought into and upon humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, the ark, and the boards which form the framework of the tabernacle show that Christ as the embodiment of God is wrought into us as the very essence that we may experience Him as life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord has to open our eyes and impress us with all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot look in the New Testament merely to find the outward items of the church and then try to form a church according to this pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is an imitation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is produced in the same way that a living person is produced, that is, by birth and growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A person can make a doll, but he cannot make a real man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is a real man, the new man Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one can make a church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church comes into being by a new birth in the Spirit and by the growth in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The development of the church comes into being by Christ being wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why I say that we should not try to form or organize anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many brothers do not realize what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They may ask, "If we do not form a church or organize anything, what are we doing here?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My response is that we have to eat and drink of Christ as our spiritual food and drink John 4:14; 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we feed on Him and drink of Him, the more we will be swallowed up by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot form or organize a church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church must be born of Christ in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church must be the living Body of Christ grown up in the Spirit with the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Surely there is the outward pattern, or form, but this is not produced by human manufacturing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead, the pattern and shape come out of the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The church grows with Christ, by Christ, and in Christ.</S>
