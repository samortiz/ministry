   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROBLEM OF CONTROL AND OF A SEPARATE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1976 when I was sharing on Matthew 23, I spoke strongly against the matter of control.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In February of 1984 in the elders training I spoke against the matter of control even more strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For some, however, this speaking was disregarded.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as there is control in a local church, there is the building up of hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the leading ones need to release the church to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament there is no such thing as the church of the apostles, the church of the elders, or the church of the evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament there are only three designations of the church: the church of God 1 Cor 1:2 , the church of Christ Rom 16:16 , and the church of the saints 1 Cor 14:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The elders, apostles, evangelists, preachers, and Christian workers are not the owners of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The owners of the church are God the Father, Christ the Savior, the Redeemer, and the redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The elders and the apostles are the slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May the Lord open our eyes to see this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you have seen this, you would never agree with any kind of control.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I fully realize that as long as the small groups could be established there would be no control.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Who can control the three hundred ninety-nine small groups in Taipei?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I made it clear to every group that they did not need to go to the elders to get permission because every believer has the full right to set up a meeting in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the day of Pentecost the three thousand all met in their homes, from house to house Acts 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Did these three thousand receive permission from Peter to meet in their homes?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Did they say, Apostle Peter, may I have a meeting in my home?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This would have been ugly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as you are a believer, you have the full right to open up a meeting in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You even have to be encouraged, charged, and burdened to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter did not control the saints, but Peter presented the heavenly vision to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let the vision control, let the vision direct, and let the vision govern.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The poor situation among us is due to the fact that we may have exercised so much control, yet we never labored on the word to release some vision, some revelation to the saints that they may have the heavenly vision controlling them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My burden is to release the divine revelation to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All my teachings and all my messages impart a vision to all the churches and this vision controls.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This kind of control is not human control, but a heavenly control by the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I encourage all the elders to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Turn from controlling the saints to laboring on the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some of the elders are afraid of losing their eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are trembling and fearful to keep their position and to keep the church in their locality under their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The root of the problem today is that with the elders there is the desire to keep a little empire and with the co-workers there is the temptation to do a work in the realm of the Lord s blessed recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the elders had no intention of keeping their empire there would be no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The elders would not control, they would not be afraid of losing their position, and they would like to see everybody be better than they are.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The recovery is really something unique.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you stay in the recovery, you enjoy the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you stay outside the recovery, there is nearly no blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some of the co-workers, though, like to stay in the recovery and yet do a separate work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The root of the problem is to do a work in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The entire globe is open to the Lord s recovery and we are short of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we had two hundred full-time workers going to South America, this would still not be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In like manner if we had two hundred full-time workers going to Africa or Europe, this still would not be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Who can close the door to the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord told the church in Philadelphia that He had the key of David and that He had put before them an open door which no one could shut Rev 3:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No one can shut the door to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Who opened the doors in the United States for the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I did not do it and I was not qualified or able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord did it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who opened the doors in Europe and South America?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The entire world is open to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I hate to see that we do not have that many proper persons going out to spread the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I expect and hope that many of you will be raised up to be more useful than I was.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many of you can testify that I do not keep any of the Lord s work in my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I beg you to forget about controlling others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us be the slaves serving the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not have any intention to do another work within the Lord s recovery, which already has a unique work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If there was not such a work, how could the recovery be here?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The recovery has been existing on this earth for sixty years among us and it has been existing in a prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord began His recovery among us with a small group of young Chinese natives.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord s recovery has been spreading over the entire earth and the ministry of my senior co-worker, Brother Nee, is so prevailing around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am proud of this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What can compare with that ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Who did this?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord Jesus did this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The enemy hates this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must realize that there is only one work for one recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you consider what I give as a message to be Witness Lee s work, you should stay away and forget about this work and the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If I had considered that whatever Watchman Nee said was his work, his word, I should have stayed away and gone back to North China to do my work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Why do I need to follow a man?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Anyone who tries to do another work within the realm of the recovery will suffer a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He will waste his time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you have a heart to carry out what the Lord has shown you as a vision, then do the same work as I did from my beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you realize that this is the Lord s recovery and that there is no other way for you to take, yet you want to do another work in the recovery, you will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You will damage others, damage yourself, and waste your time.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must remember that the root of the problems in the recovery are firstly that the elders want to keep an empire and that the co-workers want to do another work utilizing the realm and the blessing of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Forget about your empire and forget about your own work.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Let us come back to take the laboring way, diligently laboring together with the Lord in His work.</S>
