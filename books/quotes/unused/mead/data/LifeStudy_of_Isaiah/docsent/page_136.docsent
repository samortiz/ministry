   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 7 HIS BEING AN ETERNAL COVENANT TO ISRAEL,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EVEN THE SURE MERCIES SHOWN TO DAVID,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN RELATION TO ISRAEL'S PROSPERITY Scripture Reading: Isa 55 56; 42:6; 49:8; 54:10; Acts 13:34</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Isaiah 55 the most striking word is waters v. 1 . Water is also mentioned at the end of the first section of this book 12:3 . This indicates that in the book of Isaiah, God always considers that He is our salvation as living water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His salvation God gives Himself to us as our portion for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We live by three things: air, water, and food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Air is for our breathing, water is for our drinking, and food is for our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Spiritually speaking, of these three things, water is the most crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Air actually contains water, and water conveys spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Revelation 22:1 and 2, the tree of life food grows in the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, water and food go together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our eating should always be matched by our drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Isaiah 55 indicates that we need to enjoy our God as the living water, even as the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word waters here reveals that we may enjoy God not just in one aspect but in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The thought here is similar to that in John 7:38.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In that verse the Lord Jesus says, "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These rivers are the many flows of the different aspects of the divine life, such as love, light, grace, power, strength, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The book of Isaiah shows us that our God may become our enjoyment through our continual drinking of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we are sinners, and in order to drink of God, we need a proper, adequate, and complete redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This redemption is found in chapter fifty-three, a chapter which reveals more of the dynamic redemption of Christ than any other chapter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The dynamic redemption accomplished by Christ is the security not only to Israel but also to the seed 53:10 , which is the church as the corporate Body of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The record concerning this accomplished redemption in chapter fifty-three is followed in chapter fifty-five by the invitation to come to the waters and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The call here is like that at the end of the Bible: "The Spirit and the bride say, Come!...he who wills, let him take the water of life freely" Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The waters in these two portions of the Word are our redeeming God, the very God who accomplished redemption for us through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we will see, these waters are both the eternal covenant and the sure mercies shown to David Isa 55:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's way and God's thought v. 8 are that we would come to drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us now go on to see from chapters fifty-five and fifty-six that Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is an eternal covenant to Israel, even the sure mercies shown to David, in relation to Israel's prosperity.</S>
