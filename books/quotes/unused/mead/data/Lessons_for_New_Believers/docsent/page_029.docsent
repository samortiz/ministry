   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BURDEN OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every person who comes before God in prayer should not utter casual and empty words; rather, he should pray according to the burden and inward sense.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, the burden of prayer should not be so broad that it covers eight or ten points all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people pray as if they are reciting a book or taking attendance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of prayer is very light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order for our prayer to be weighty, our burden should not be too broad.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the most, good prayer should comprise three or four items.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The best is to pray for one or two items.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there are several items, it is better to pray for a few items and pray for the rest at a different time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This can be compared to moving five boxes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we overestimate ourselves and try to move all five at once, we will be unable to move them and may even drop them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should first move two boxes, then another two, and the last one at the end. In this way we can move all the boxes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>WAITING IN PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everyone who prays should learn to wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should never initiate anything by ourselves when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to be calm and wait before God for His instructions and initiation in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All good prayers are initiated by God, not by us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we pray, we must first stop ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our stopping is to wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are many who have difficulties in the matter of waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once they cease all activity in the midst of their prayer, their mind becomes more active.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need much exercise in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to exercise to the extent that once we kneel down before God, our whole being is calm and able to wait for His instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we have God s instruction and initiation, there will be a sense within and a word of burden.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can then start praying according to His inward burden.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>INQUIRING IN PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When coming before God, many people immediately begin to ask God for things and never inquire of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not ask God for things, but rather we should inquire of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if we want to pray for the church, we should first inquire of the Lord, saying, Lord, I have a feeling to pray for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is this Your will?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do You want me to pray for the church at this moment?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How should I pray?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Prayer that is preceded by inquiring is the best prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Inquiring in prayer and waiting in prayer are two sides of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One who waits is one who inquires.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Similarly, a person who inquires is a person who waits.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Abraham s prayer in Genesis 18 was very good; there was an aspect of waiting in his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible says that when the two angels turned and went toward Sodom, Abraham remained standing before God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While waiting, he began to intercede.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was not telling or begging; he was inquiring.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said, Will you indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was inquiring.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To inquire is to acknowledge the sovereign authority of God, that is, to acknowledge that He is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who know how to pray always inquire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Listen to the prayer of one of the psalmists in Psalm 27:4.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He says, One thing I have asked from Jehovah; / That do I seek: / To dwell in the house of Jehovah / All the days of my life, / To behold the beauty of Jehovah, / And to inquire in His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was inquiring in the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, in the books of Samuel, David had several prayers in which he inquired of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Asking for things does not require any learning, but inquiring requires a great deal of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>TELLING</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is the need of telling in our prayer in addition to asking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To tell is to speak to God concerning our feelings; to ask is to request from God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are these different aspects of prayer that require our exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>FAITH IN PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to learn to have faith in inquiring, telling, and even asking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The most crucial thing in order to have faith is to be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not analyze, but simply believe in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God s word is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After prayer, we may sometimes have a word within from the Bible that clearly tells us that God has heard us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are also other times when we pray to the extent that our inner sense tells us that God has heard our prayer, although there is not an explicit word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we sense that the burden within has been discharged, and there is no further problem in the matter of our request, we should believe.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not analyze, doubt, or worry, because this will only cause us to lose faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If a burden is still present after we pray, we should pray again.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should pray until the burden has been lifted and is no longer with us, until we have peace within and no longer feel the need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In such a condition, we should believe that God has heard our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to learn to simply believe in God s word and in the feeling within.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>GIVING THANKS IN PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who know how to pray always give a considerable amount of thanks in their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is unreasonable to ask without thanking.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We always thank someone who agrees to do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We not only thank him when he has accomplished the task, but we even thank him when he merely agrees to do the task.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Consequently, there should be thanksgiving in every prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Once we have peace within and the burden has been lifted, we should give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should say, Thank You, Lord, that I can tell You what concerns me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I have peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I believe You have heard my prayer and answered my petition.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should not wait until our prayer is fulfilled to give thanks; we should begin giving thanks even before it is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Each time we sense peace within as we pray, we should give thanks.</S>
