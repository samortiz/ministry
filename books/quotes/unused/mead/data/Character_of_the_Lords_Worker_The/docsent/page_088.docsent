   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers and sisters, when we are free, we have to learn to relax our muscles.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While we are sleeping, all of our limbs should be relaxed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should be able to stretch our capacity when there is the need for it, and when we do, we should be able to handle more stress than the strongest men.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our body has to obey us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we cannot be under stress all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our muscles and nerves often need relaxation and rest; we have to find opportunity to allow our body to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is one way the body balances itself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not find time to rest, we will push ourselves beyond the limit and go to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not men of extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to trust in the Lord regarding our body, yet at the same time we have to follow natural laws and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a very basic lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to learn to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we learn to let go, we will find it easier to rest and sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Experienced ones have told us that counting the number of times one breathes can help a person to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we are asleep, our breathing is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It may not be that easy to control our sleep, but it is easy to control our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can count the number of times we breathe, and we should not breathe quickly, but slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can learn to adjust our breathing to the sleeping mode.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our mind should be set not on sleeping but on breathing, on counting the number of breaths.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, we control our breathing to the speed we would breathe in our sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After a while, we will go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people are able to go to sleep with this method.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In our sleep we breathe slowly and deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By controlling our breathing, making it slow and deep, we can induce sleep for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We often need to count only up to a few hundred and then we are asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to believe that the body God has created for us is good enough to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to trust in God, and we also have to trust in God's law in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has created a head for us that will go to sleep, and we should be able to go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should try to relax our whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will give us rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are not able to rest, we will be constantly under tension, day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a condition will not sustain us to accomplish many things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may be sick; we may be bound by more than one illness, but if we take care of our body a little more, we will save ourselves from many worries.</S>
