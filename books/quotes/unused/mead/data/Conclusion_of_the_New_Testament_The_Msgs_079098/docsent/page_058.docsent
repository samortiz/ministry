   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Infusing His according-to-God Mind into Them in Their Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the Spirit works in the believers by helping them in their weakness and by interceding for them with groanings, He infuses His according-to-God mind into them in their prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to God" Rom 8:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whereas Ephesians 4:23 speaks of the spirit of the mind, this verse speaks of the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spirit of the mind is for renewing, and the mind of the Spirit is for interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, it is difficult to say to whose mind Paul is referring in Romans 8:27, because the Spirit is mingled with our spirit and the Spirit is interceding within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In our groaning there is the groaning of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit groans in our groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may even say that it is the Spirit's groaning groaned by us, expressed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, it is actually our groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same principle, in verse 27 we have the Spirit's mind, but now the Spirit's mind is one with our mind because our mind is set on the spirit v. 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes we are burdened to pray, but do not know what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At such times we may groan, "O Lord, O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is our groaning because it is uttered by us, yet that groaning begins from the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It begins in our spirit and comes out of the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not merely a sound of groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Within our groaning there is a mind because there is a thought or meaning in this groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the mind is involved, but whose mind is it?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not merely the Spirit's mind; it is the Spirit's mind mingled with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our mind is set on the spirit, making our mind one with the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 8:27 says that He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whose heart is mentioned here?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Surely this is not the heart of the Spirit; this must be our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God searches our hearts, yet He knows what is the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This proves that the mind here is not the independent mind of the Spirit; it is the mind of the Spirit mingled with our mind and becoming a part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is our heart and the Spirit's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God searching our heart knows the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that our mind is one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit's mind is one with our mind, and our mingled mind even becomes a part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Testament revelation gives us a clear view of such a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our mind can be set on the spirit, making our mind one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the Spirit's mind is one with our mind, and this mingled heart, this mingled mind, becomes a part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now when we groan, our groaning is not a religious prayer but an aspiration from the depths of our being, where the mingling of divinity with humanity is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the result of the Spirit's work of infusing His according-to-God mind into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>42.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the Means for Them to Guard the Good Deposit</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit working in us is the means for us to guard the good deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul charged Timothy: "Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us" 2 Tim 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This deposit consisted in that which was committed and entrusted to Timothy, the healthy words which he received from Paul, not only for himself but also for others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During the years Timothy was with Paul, many truths were deposited into him by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, there was within Timothy a good deposit, a deposit that he was to guard by means of the indwelling Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From the time we were saved we have received many things from God as a deposit, like a deposit in a bank.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Within us, and especially within our spirit, we have a divine deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's life, God's Spirit, and all the precious truths we have seen in the Lord's recovery have been deposited into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How can we guard this deposit?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can guard this deposit only through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we act, behave, and have our life in the Spirit, all that has been deposited into us will be guarded.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if we neglect the Spirit and walk in the flesh and according to our mind, we shall be the same as the nations, who are apart from God Eph 4:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If this is our situation, there will not be any guarding of the good things that have been deposited into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to guard the good deposit by the Spirit, who is working within us to keep us in the divine fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we are preserved in fellowship with the Triune God, we shall have an intensified care for all the truths that have been deposited into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, guarding the good deposit through the Holy Spirit requires that we exercise our spirit.</S>
