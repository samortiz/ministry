   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Their Measure</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the prescription for the ointment recorded in Exodus 30, definite quantities are designated for each ingredient.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But in the prescription for the incense, no quantities whatever are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the meaning of this?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that Christ is immeasurable, unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With this incense there is no measurement, no weight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the entire universe there are no means available to weigh Christ, there is no scale large enough to measure Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ephesians tells us that Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may have studied modern science can you tell how long is the length, how high is the height, or how broad is the breadth?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The answer is this: the length is just Christ, the height is just Christ; the length is as long as Christ; the height is as high as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It says furthermore regarding the incense that all the ingredients must be in like proportion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This simply means that Christ is balanced in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In all that He is, in all His being and in all that He does, He is so balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are all unbalanced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes a brother is so humble, but he is also rather slow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who are humble always have an amount of slowness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not like the slowness; we like the speed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But with those who are quick, there is always an amount of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Neither are balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Take a good look at the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels: He is so balanced; every part is in right proportion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is immeasurable, but balanced; He is unlimited, but so fine and equal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No human words can adequately explain Him, but we have such a picture from which we may learn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Seasoned, Ground, and Burnt</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All four ingredients of the incense when mingled together must be seasoned with salt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Salt is not one of the main elements, but something added to season the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is the meaning of this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a type of Christ s nature, a nature which is incorruptible, a nature which remains forever the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All that Christ is, all that Christ does, is a kind of incense before God; His fragrance is unchangeable and incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is nothing in the universe like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With this incense there is no need of refrigeration it is seasoned with salt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In salt there is corruption-killing power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In typology it signifies the keeping and killing power of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The death of Christ has such power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would offer this incense to God, we must grind or beat it into small pieces, even to powder v. 36 . Finally, it must be burnt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In summary, the incense must be seasoned, ground, and burnt.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes it seems that we have some experiences of Christ, but they do not remain long; they are here today and gone tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because they are not seasoned with salt.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Three days ago brother so-and-so may have given a marvelous testimony, but tonight when he is speaking, there is a clear sense of oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His experience has not been seasoned with salt.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes you may sense that the testimony given by a brother is good, but there is no beating, no grinding.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His experience of Christ is good, but it has never been broken into pieces or ground into powder.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What do I mean by this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose a sister has a real experience of Christ and in the meeting relates it with a long speech.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose then that while she is speaking one of the brothers interrupts her and asks her to abbreviate her testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If so, she may really be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She may say, If they treat me like that, I will never come to the meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She has had a good experience of Christ, but she has not been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How could our experiences of Christ become a sweet fragrance to God?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They require the beating, the breaking, and eventually the burning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When our experiences pass through all of these processes, they become a sweet savor to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We not only need to experience the essence of what Christ is and does, but our experiences of this Christ must be seasoned, beaten, ground, and burnt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sometimes when others give testimonies, we sense that they are good, but they are stretched and raw.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are incense, but they are not burnt.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Anything after being burnt is reduced; it is not so great in form or in quantity, neither is it so fine in quality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is reduced to ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whatever we offer to God will be consumed, but it will be so fragrant to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The experiences of Christ are indeed good and fragrant to us, but they need to be burnt that they may be fragrant to God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we would have a proper church life, this is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not just that we all have some experiences of Christ and bring them to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may do that and we should do that, but we still need the seasoning, the breaking, and the burning; otherwise, the more experiences of Christ we have, the more of a problem we will be to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only when we are seasoned, broken, and burnt, will the church be built up, and we will have the fragrance of burnt incense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We will have a little heap of ashes, not much in form or quantity, and not even so good in quality, but so sweet and fragrant to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This kind of incense must be the content of our praises and our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not just that we are so happy; so we come to the meeting to rejoice and to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need firstly the real experiences of Christ with all the ingredients of the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need secondly the seasoning, the breaking, and the burning of this incense to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the incense we should offer to God in His tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The tabernacle of the congregation in verse 36 should be the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the way for us to meet, and this is the way to be built up together by meeting one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Experience is indispensable for the burning of the incense the experiences of Christ, seasoned, beaten and burnt.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These must be offered not in our home, but in the tent of meeting for the building up of the local church, God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May the Lord unveil these things to us.</S>
