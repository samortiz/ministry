   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FORTY-SIX THE FIRSTFRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter twelve we have seen a clear vision of a universal woman bearing a man-child and confronting a great dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all have been deeply impressed with this sign.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter thirteen we saw two beasts Antichrist and the false prophet, both of whom collaborate with the dragon, Satan, to oppose God and to hinder the completion of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Following this, we have more crucial matters in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we not only see the firstfruit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-5 , but the things that follow the rapture of the firstfruit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>6-13 : the preaching of the eternal gospel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>6-7 , the fall of religious Babylon v. 8 , the warning against the worship of the beast and his image and against the mark vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>9-11 , and the martyrdom during the great tribulation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition, chapter fourteen covers the harvest vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>14-16 and the great winepress vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>17-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter fourteen has four main categories: the rapture of the firstfruit; the things following the rapture of the firstfruit; the harvest, which is the reaping of the majority of the believers; and the great winepress, which is the reaping of the evil people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, this chapter reveals how everyone living on earth at the end time will be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Everyone on earth falls into one of two categories: those who are the people of God and those who are not the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The people of God are composed of Christians and Israelites, the God-fearing Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Israel is not covered in this chapter, because it was already covered in chapter seven with the vision of the sealing of the one hundred forty-four thousand chosen Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This chapter unfolds God s dealing with the Christian portion of His people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Among this part of His people, there are also two main sections: the firstfruit, those who ripen early, and the harvest, those who ripen later.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Between the rapture of the firstfruit and the rapture of the harvest, four main things will occur: the preaching of the eternal gospel; the fall of Babylon the great, that is, religious Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church; the warning against the worship of the beast; and the great martyrdom during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the harvest, the situation among the Christians will be cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But those who are not God s people will still be on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are not considered as the wheat in God s field, but as grapes in the evil field.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These grapes will be gathered into the great winepress and trodden by the Lord Jesus vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that time the whole earth will be cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, chapter fourteen is a very significant chapter, revealing how the situation of everyone on earth will be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is wise, righteous, and sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By His wisdom, righteousness, and sovereignty He will deal with everyone on earth in the proper way and at the proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is prophesied in the Bible is simply a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not have the details.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the Lord had given us all the details of the things to come, the Bible would have thousands of pages, and we would not be able to carry it around.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We thank the Lord for His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have pointed out that all the world powers from Babylon to the coming revived Roman Empire with the ten kingdoms are represented by the huge image Nebuchadnezzar saw in a dream Dan 2:31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The head signifies Babylon; the breast and arms, Medo-Persia; the belly and the thighs, Greece; and the two legs, the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is a historical fact that the Roman Empire was divided into two sections signified by the legs of the image.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The period indicated by the ankle is ambiguous.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Presently we are living in this ambiguous period.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A gap was created by the termination of the Roman Empire in A.D. 476, but during this time that gap is being filled in by the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the close of this long interval, the Roman Empire will be revived and consummate in the ten kingdoms signified by the ten toes of the image.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to Daniel 2, these ten kingdoms will be smashed by a stone cut without hands vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This stone is Christ, who will come from the heavens to smite the entire image, including everything from Nebuchadnezzar to the last Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In His wisdom God has used the image of the human body to give a clear picture of the various stages of the worldly powers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the way and the principle of prophecy in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In a sense, the prophecy in the Bible is very brief.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The principle is the same with respect to the rapture of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is a difference between the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have covered this matter of the rapture in messages twenty-nine and thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Based upon the principle of these two kinds of rapture, we come now to the firstfruit.</S>
