   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 10 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 John 2:20 And you have an anointing from the Holy One...</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rom 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Compound Ointment continued</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The record concerning the compound ointment in Exodus 30 is extremely significant....The revelation concerning the compound ointment was not given in chapter one of Exodus...but toward the end of chapter thirty, after God s dwelling place the tabernacle and the priesthood God s serving ones had been revealed....</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Exodus 30:26-28, 30 make it very clear that the compound ointment was strictly for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>109 Where are you concerning the enjoyment of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are you before the revelation of the tabernacle and the priesthood, or after?...This ointment can be enjoyed only after God s dwelling place and the body of serving ones have come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not for God s chosen people to enjoy apart from God s dwelling and His priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>110 ...This indicates that the compound Spirit is for God s building and for His priesthood....Only those who are for the building of God and the priesthood of God can have the enjoyment of the compound, all-inclusive, processed Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the ingredients, all the rich elements, of the compound Spirit are for God s house and God s priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>111</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First John 2:20 says that we have an anointing from the Holy One, and verse 27 says that this anointing abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the anglicized form of the Greek word Christos, which means the anointed One....As soon as we believed in Him, He as the Spirit entered our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now He is within our spirit to anoint us, paint us, with the element of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more this painting goes on, the more the element of the Triune God is transfused into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>112 Remember, God s desire is to add Himself into us, to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While the Holy Spirit is anointing us, He kills the negative things in our being, and He purifies and cleanses us with all that Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>113 Today we all are under the anointing of the compound Spirit with Christ s divinity, humanity, all-inclusive death, and wonderful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the Spirit as the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>114</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit His Work</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we shall go on to one aspect of the Spirit s work... in the believers for the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>115</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Freeing the Believers by His Law of Life</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>from the Law of Sin and Death</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Romans 8:2... law does not denote a commandment but a principle that operates automatically and spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A law is a natural regulation, a constant and unchanging rule.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every kind of life has such a law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The law of a certain life is the innate ability of that life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This ability is inborn, spontaneous, automatic, constant, and instant.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>116 A grain of wheat grows out wheat, and a peach tree brings forth peaches because there is a life law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>117 There is no need to teach a peach tree to bring forth peaches because there is a law of life in that plant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the same way, there is a law in our fallen human life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need for anyone to teach us to lie or to commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have an evil life with an evil law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We praise the Lord that today we have another law, the law of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>118 Since by regeneration we have received the life of God, we have naturally received from the life of God the most high and surpassing law of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>119 With this life is the divine law that sets us free from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>120</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is the way to give this divine law the proper opportunity and environment?...In order to let the Lord grow in us and let the divine law work within us, we must love the Lord, but we must also stop ourselves from trying to do anything....We should pray, Lord, I love You, but Lord, I stop.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not stop loving, but we stop doing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>121</S>
